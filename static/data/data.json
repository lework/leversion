This\r\n\"advanced\" configuration gives the operator the ability to configure readiness and liveness to handle taking pods out\r\nof the pool of pods that can serve traffic.\r\n\r\n(#6794, @seth-epps)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Update to Gateway API v1.2.1\r\n\r\nGateway API CRD compatibility has been updated to release v1.2.1.\r\n\r\nFull release notes for Gateway API v1.2.0 can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0), and v1.2.1 [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- The HTTP compression algorithm can now be configured using the `compression.algorithm` field in the configuration file or the `spec.envoy.listener.compression.algorithm` field in the `ContourConfiguration` CRD. The available values are `gzip` (default), `brotli`, `zstd`, and `disabled`. (#6546, @chaosbox)\r\n- Fixed a bug where follower Contour instance occasionally got stuck in a non-ready state when using `--watch-namespaces` flag. (#6614, @tsaarni)\r\n- Contour, support http and https as AppProtocol in k8s' services (#6616, @Krast76)\r\n- Added conditions `reset-before-request`, `envoy-ratelimited` and `http3-post-connect-failure` for `httpproxy.spec.routes.retryPolicy.retryOn`, see Envoy [documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.32.0/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-retry-on) for more details. (#6772, @tsaarni)\r\n- `HTTPProxy.spec.routes.requestRedirectPolicy.statusCode` now supports 303, 307 and 308 redirect status codes in addition to 301 and 302. (#6789, @billyjs)\r\n- Adds a new configuration option `strip-trailing-host-dot` which defines if trailing dot of the host should be removed from host/authority header before any processing of request by HTTP filters or routing. (#6792, @saley89)\r\n- Updates kind node image for e2e tests to Kubernetes 1.32. Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.32, 1.31 and 1.30. (#6834, @skriss)\r\n- Fixed a memory leak in Contour follower instance due to unprocessed LoadBalancer status updates. (#6872, @tsaarni)\r\n- Add support for the SECP521R1 curve, enabling the use of EC certificates with 521-bit private keys in the xDS gRPC interface between Envoy and Contour. (#6996, @tsaarni)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.34.0.

(#7019, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n\r\n## xDS server type fields in config file and ContourConfiguration CRD and legacy `contour` xDS server are removed\r\n\r\nContour now uses a go-control-plane-based xDS server.\r\nThe legacy `contour` xDS server that pre-dates `go-control-plane` has been removed.\r\nSince there is now only one supported xDS server, the config fields for selecting an xDS server implementation have been removed.\r\n\r\n(#6568, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## useEndpointSlices feature flag removed\r\n\r\nAs of v1.29.0, Contour has used the Kubernetes EndpointSlices API by default to determine the endpoints to configure Envoy with, instead of the Endpoints API.\r\nThe Endpoints API is also deprecated in upstream Kubernetes as of v1.33 (see announcement [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/24/endpoints-deprecation/)).\r\nEndpointSlice support is now stable in Contour and the remaining Endpoint handling code, along with the associated `useEndpointSlices` feature flag, has been removed.\r\nThis should be a no-op change for most users, only affecting those that opted into continuing to use the Endpoints API and possibly also disabled EndpointSlice mirroring of Endpoints.\r\n\r\n(#7008, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.31.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.30 through 1.32.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

While kOps has always followed the version-skew policy, there was an edge case:\r\nnodes that were added by an autoscaler during a rolling-update would not always follow the version-skew policy.\r\nWe recommend trying the new kops reconcile command, see [docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md) for more

The old `--config` parameter has been removed. Use the `--config-file` parameter instead. Configuration can be provided in json, yaml or any other format that viper supports.\n\nThe following fields can be dynamically changed -\n1. `instance-poll-time`\n2. `prevent-cross-cell-failover`\n3. `snapshot-topology-interval`\n4. `reasonable-replication-lag`\n5. `audit-to-backend`\n6. `audit-to-syslog`\n7. `audit-purge-duration`\n8. `wait-replicas-timeout`\n9. `tolerable-replication-lag`\n10. `topo-information-refresh-duration`\n11. `recovery-poll-duration`\n12. `allow-emergency-reparent`\n13. `change-tablets-with-errant-gtid-to-drained`\n\nTo upgrade to the new version of the configuration file, first switch to using the flags in your current deployment before upgrading. Then you can switch to using the configuration file after upgrade.\n\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-config-file-changes\"/>VTGate</a>\n\nThe Viper configuration keys for the following flags has been changed to match their flag names. Previously they had a discovery prefix instead of it being part of the name.\n\n| Flag Name                                        | Old Configuration Key                            | New Configuration Key                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| `discovery_low_replication_lag`                  | `discovery.low_replication_lag`                  | `discovery_low_replication_lag`                  |\n| `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` | `discovery.high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` | `discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving` |\n| `discovery_min_number_serving_vttablets`         | `discovery.min_number_serving_vttablets`         | `discovery_min_number_serving_vttablets`         |\n| `discovery_legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     | `discovery.legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     | `discovery_legacy_replication_lag_algorithm`     |\n\nTo upgrade to the newer version of the configuration keys, first switch to using the flags in your current deployment before upgrading. Then you can switch to using the new configuration keys after upgrade.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"vtorc\"/>VTOrc</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"stall-disk-recovery-vtorc\"/>Stalled Disk Recovery</a>\n\nVTOrc can now identify and recover from stalled disk errors.\nVTTablets test whether the disk is writable and they send this information in the `FullStatus` RPC response to VTOrc.\nIf the disk is not writable on the primary tablet, VTOrc will attempt to recover the cluster by promoting a new primary.\nThis is useful in scenarios where the disk is stalled and the primary vttablet is unable to accept writes because of it.\n\nTo opt into this feature, `--enable-primary-disk-stalled-recovery` flag has to be specified on VTOrc, and `--disk-write-dir` flag has to be specified on the vttablets.\n`--disk-write-interval` and `--disk-write-timeout` flags can be used to configure the polling interval and timeout respectively.\n\n#### <a id=\"key-range-vtorc\"/>KeyRanges in `--clusters_to_watch`</a>\nVTOrc now supports specifying keyranges in the `--clusters_to_watch` flag. This means that there is no need to restart a VTOrc instance with a different flag value when you reshard a keyspace.\n\nFor example, if a VTOrc is configured to watch `ks/-80`, then it would watch all the shards that fall under the keyrange `-80`.\nIf a reshard is performed and `-80` is split into new shards `-40` and `40-80`, the VTOrc instance will automatically start watching the new shards without needing a restart.\nIn the previous logic, specifying `ks/-80` for the flag would mean that VTOrc would watch only 1 (or no) shard.\nIn the new system, since we interpret `-80` as a key range, it can watch multiple shards as described in the example.\n\nUsers can continue to specify exact keyranges. The new feature is backward compatible.\n\n---\n### <a id=\"new-default-versions\"/>New Default Versions</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"mysql-8-0-40\"/>MySQL 8.0.40</a>\n\nThe default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `8.0.30` to `8.0.40`.\nThis change was merged in [#17552](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17552).\n\nVTGate also advertises MySQL version `8.0.40` by default instead of `8.0.30`. If that is not what you are running, you can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the desired version.\n\n>  \u26a0\ufe0f Upgrading to this release with vitess-operator:\n>\n> If you are using the `vitess-operator`, considering that we are bumping the MySQL version from `8.0.30` to `8.0.40`, you will have to manually upgrade:\n>\n> 1. Add `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` to your extra cnf in your YAML file.\n> 2. Apply this file.\n> 3. Wait for all the pods to be healthy.\n> 4. Then change your YAML file to use the new Docker Images (`vitess/lite:v22.0.0`).\n> 5. Remove `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` from your extra cnf in your YAML file.\n> 6. Apply this file.\n>\n> This is the last time this will be needed in the `8.0.x` series, as starting with MySQL `8.0.35` it is possible to upgrade and downgrade between `8.0.x` versions without needing to run `innodb_fast_shutdown=0`.\n\n#### <a id=\"debian-bookworm\"/>Docker `vitess/lite` images with Debian Bookworm</a>\n\nThe docker build system now uses Debian Bookworm instead of Debian Bullseye for the `vitess/lite` images. This change was merged in [#17552](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17552).\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"new-support\"/>New Support</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"efficient-json-replication\"/>More Efficient JSON Replication</a>\n\nIn [#7345](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17345) we added support for [`--binlog-row-value-options=PARTIAL_JSON`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_value_options). You can read more about [this feature added to MySQL 8.0 here](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/efficient-json-replication-in-mysql-8-0/).\n\nIf you are using MySQL 8.0 or later and using JSON columns, you can now enable this MySQL feature across your Vitess cluster(s) to lower the disk space needed for binary logs and improve the CPU and memory usage in both `mysqld` (standard intrashard MySQL replication) and `vttablet` ([VReplication](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vreplication/)) without losing any capabilities or features.\n\n#### <a id=\"last-insert-id\"/>`LAST_INSERT_ID(x)`</a>\n\nIn [#17408](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17408) and [#17409](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17409), we added the ability to use `LAST_INSERT_ID(x)` in Vitess directly at vtgate. This improvement allows certain queries\u2014like `SELECT last_insert_id(123);` or `SELECT last_insert_id(count(*)) ...`\u2014to be handled without relying on MySQL for the final value.\n\n**Limitations**:\n- When using `LAST_INSERT_ID(x)` in ordered queries (e.g., `SELECT last_insert_id(col) FROM table ORDER BY foo`), MySQL sets the session\u2019s last-insert-id value according to the *last row returned*. Vitess does not guarantee the same behavior.\n\n#### <a id=\"max-idle-connections\"/>Maximum Idle Connections in the Pool</a>\n\nIn [#17443](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17443) we introduced a new configurable max-idle-count parameter for connection pools. This allows you to specify the maximum number of idle connections retained in each connection pool to optimize performance and resource efficiency.\n\nYou can control idle connection retention for the query server\u2019s query pool, stream pool, and transaction pool with the following flags:\n\u2022\t--queryserver-config-query-pool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the query pool.\n\u2022\t--queryserver-config-stream-pool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the stream pool.\n\u2022\t--queryserver-config-txpool-max-idle-count: Defines the maximum number of idle connections retained in the transaction pool.\n\nThis feature ensures that, during traffic spikes, idle connections are available for faster responses, while minimizing overhead in low-traffic periods by limiting the number of idle connections retained. It helps strike a balance between performance, efficiency, and cost.\n\n#### <a id=\"query-logs\"/>Filtering Query logs on Error</a>\n\nThe `querylog-mode` setting can be configured to `error` to log only queries that result in errors. This option is supported in both VTGate and VTTablet.\n\n---\n\n#### <a id=\"multiquery\"/>MultiQuery RPC in vtgate</a>\n\nNew RPCs have been added to VTGate that allow users to pass multiple queries in a single sql string. The behavior is the same as that of MySQL: the RPCs will return multiple result sets in the same order as the queries until and unless an error is encountered. The new RPCs are `ExecuteMulti` and `StreamExecuteMulti`. \n\nA new flag `--mysql-server-multi-query-protocol` has also been added that makes the server use this new implementation. This flag is set to `false` by default, so the old implementation is used by default. The new implementation is more efficient and allows for better performance when executing multiple queries in a single RPC call.\n\n---\n\n#### <a id=\"create-procedure\"/>Unsharded `CREATE PROCEDURE` support</a>\n\nUntil now Vitess didn't allow users to create procedures through VTGate. They had to be created by running a DDL directly against the underlying MySQL. In this release, we have started adding support for running `CREATE PROCEDURE` statements through VTGate for unsharded keyspaces. Not all constructs of procedures are currently supported in the parser, so there are still some limitations which will be addressed in future releases.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"optimization\"/>Optimization</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"prepared-statement\"/>Prepared Statement</a>\nPrepared statements now benefit from Deferred Optimization, enabling parameter-aware query plans. \nInitially, a baseline plan is created at prepare-time, and on first execution, a more efficient parameter-optimized plan is generated. \nSubsequent executions dynamically switch between these plans based on input values, improving query performance while ensuring correctness.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"rpc-changes\"/>New VtctldServer RPC</a>\n\n`GetTransactionInfo` RPC has been added to `VtctldServer` and `TabletManagerClient` interfaces. These RPCs can be used to read the state of an unresolved distributed transaction. This can be useful in debugging what went wrong and how to fix the problem.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"reparents-prefer-not-backing-up\"/>Prefer not promoting a replica that is currently taking a backup\n\nEmergency reparents now prefer to not promote replicas that are currently taking backups with a backup engine other than\n`builtin`. Note that if there's only one suitable replica to promote, and it is taking a backup, it will still be\npromoted.\n\nFor planned reparents, hosts taking backups with a backup engine other than `builtin` are filtered out of the list of\nvalid candidates. This means they will never get promoted - not even if there are no other candidates.\n\nNote that behavior for `builtin` backups remains unchanged: a replica that is currently taking a `builtin` backup will\nnever be promoted, neither by planned nor by emergency reparents.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"semi-sync-monitor\"/>Semi-sync monitor in vttablet</a>\n\nPrimary VTTablets now monitor the semi-sync status of their underlying MySQL instance .\nWe've observed cases where a brief network disruption can cause the primary to get stuck indefinitely waiting for semi-sync ACKs.\nIn rare scenarios, this can also block reparent operations and render the primary unresponsive.\nMore information can be found in the issues [#17709](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/17709) and [#17749](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/17749).\n\nTo address this, the primary VTTablets continuously monitor their semi-sync status. If the primary MySQL gets stuck waiting for semi-sync ACKs, the monitor generates synthetic writes to unblock it. If this fails, VTOrc is notified of the issue and it will initiate an emergency reparent operation.\n\nThe monitoring interval can be adjusted using the `--semi-sync-monitor-interval` flag, which defaults to 10 seconds.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"new-errors-fatal-tx\"/>Wrapped fatal transaction errors</a>\n\nWhen a query fails while running in a transaction, due to the transaction no longer being valid (e.g. PRS, rollout, primary down, etc.), the original error is now wrapped in a `VT15001` error.\n\nWhen a query produce a `VT15001` error, VTGate will try to rollback and clear the transaction.\nAny new queries on the same connection will fail with a `VT09032` error, until a `ROLLBACK` is received\nto acknowledge that the transaction was automatically rolled back and cleared by VTGate.\n\n`VT09032` is returned to clients to avoid applications blindly sending queries to VTGate thinking they are still in a transaction.\n\nThis change was introduced by [#17669](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17669).\n\n\n---\n\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor Changes</a>\n\n### <a id=\"topo-read-concurrency-changes\"/>`--topo_read_concurrency` behaviour changes\n\nThe `--topo_read_concurrency` flag was added to all components that access the topology and the provided limit is now applied separately for each global or local cell _(default `32`)_.\n\nAll topology read calls _(`Get`, `GetVersion`, `List` and `ListDir`)_ now respect this per-cell limit. Previous to this version a single limit was applied to all cell calls and it was not respected by many topology calls.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"minor-changes-vttablet\"/>VTTablet</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"flags-vttablet\"/>CLI Flags</a>\n\n- `twopc_abandon_age` flag now supports values in the time.Duration format (e.g., 1s, 2m, 1h). \nWhile the flag will continue to accept float values (interpreted as seconds) for backward compatibility, \n**float inputs are deprecated** and will be removed in a future release.\n\n- `--consolidator-query-waiter-cap` flag to set the maximum number of clients allowed to wait on the consolidator. The default value is set to 0 for unlimited wait. Users can adjust  this value based on the performance of VTTablet to avoid excessive memory usage and the risk of being OOMKilled, particularly in Kubernetes deployments.\n\n#### <a id=\"reloading-vttablet-acl\"/>ACL enforcement and reloading</a>\n\nWhen a tablet is started with `--enforce-tableacl-config` it will exit with an error if the contents of the file are not valid. After the changes made in [#17485](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17485) the tablet will no longer exit when reloading the contents of the file after receiving a SIGHUP. When the file contents are invalid on reload the tablet will now log an error and the active in-memory ACLs remain in effect.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin\n\n#### <a id=\"updated-node\"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v22.13.1 (LTS)\n\nBuilding `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v22.13.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v20 to v22 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.13.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.\nFull details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.13.1.\n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/22.0/22.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 475 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @L3o-pold, @akagami-harsh, @anirbanmu, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthmis, @arthurschreiber, @beingnoble03, @c-r-dev, @corbantek, @dbussink, @deepthi, @derekperkins, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @garfthoffman, @gmpify, @gopoto, @harshit-gangal, @huochexizhan, @jeefy, @jwangace, @kbutz, @lmorduch, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @maxenglander, @mcrauwel, @mounicasruthi, @niladrix719, @notfelineit, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shailpujan88, @shanth96, @shlomi-noach, @siadat, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @twthorn, @vitess-bot, @vmg, @wiebeytec, @wukuai\n\n", "created_at": "2025-04-29T13:04:37Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v1.0.0 \"Oriental Omnidroid\"", "tag_name": "v1.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v1.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 1.0.0 is live \ud83c\udf89 StepActions are GA and Git resolvers enhancements \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v1.0.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v1.0.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v1.0.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v1.0.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v1.0.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attestation\r\n\r\nThe Rekor UUID for this release is `108e9186e8c5677a3c232a877172a3c7967bdcb84afa4bc0a3819fe35e8796e324bbc364356d4349`\r\n\r\nObtain the attestation:\r\n```shell\r\nREKOR_UUID=108e9186e8c5677a3c232a877172a3c7967bdcb84afa4bc0a3819fe35e8796e324bbc364356d4349\r\nrekor-cli get --uuid $REKOR_UUID --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq .\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify that all container images in the attestation are in the release file:\r\n```shell\r\nRELEASE_FILE=https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v1.0.0/release.yaml\r\nREKOR_UUID=108e9186e8c5677a3c232a877172a3c7967bdcb84afa4bc0a3819fe35e8796e324bbc364356d4349\r\n\r\n# Obtains the list of images with sha from the attestation\r\nREKOR_ATTESTATION_IMAGES=$(rekor-cli get --uuid \"$REKOR_UUID\" --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq -r '.subject[]|.name + \":v1.0.0@sha256:\" + .digest.sha256')\r\n\r\n# Download the release file\r\ncurl \"$RELEASE_FILE\" > release.yaml\r\n\r\n# For each image in the attestation, match it to the release file\r\nfor image in $REKOR_ATTESTATION_IMAGES; do\r\n  printf $image; grep -q $image release.yaml && echo \" ===> ok\" || echo \" ===> no match\";\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Any special upgrade notice\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: fix: resolve Git Anonymous Resolver excessive memory usage (#8677)\r\n\r\nRemoteResolutions using the Git Resolver now use the `git` binary instead of  the Golang library `go-git` to shallow-clone, shallow-fetch, then checkout the provided repository at the given revision.

This means vmagents with `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` will re-shard series after the upgrade, which may result into temporary higher churn rate and memory usage on remote destinations.\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: all the VictoriaMetrics components: mask `authKey` value from log messages. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5973) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [dashboards/per-tenant-statistic](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/dashboards/clusterbytenant.json): add panel for showing churn rate generated by each tenant on short time-window. The panel should make temporary spikes in churn more visible.\r\n* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add additional metric name stats to TSDB Status API response. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6145) for details and this [doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#tsdb-stats).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): dynamically upgrade to [VM remote write protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol) or downgrade to Prometheus protocol in runtime. This solves the problem of choosing the wrong protocol if remote destination was unavailable on vmagent start. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8462) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): use consistent hashing for data distribution for remote write when `remoteWrite.shardByURL` is enabled. It helps to minimize re-sharding when removing or adding new remote write destinations. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8546) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce log noise from remote write retries by throttling warning messages to one per 5 seconds. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8723) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add command-line flag `-search.logSlowQueryStats`. This flag is available only in VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/). See the following [docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/query-stats) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): enhance  `/api/v1/status/metric_names_stats` with `match_pattern` regex support. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6145) for details and related [docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#track-ingested-metrics-usage)\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add helpful hints to the unexpected EOF error message in the write concurrency limiter. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8704) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): log client network errors (EOFs, timeouts) during handshake as warnings, since they are not actionable from server point of view.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add `Requests count` and `Last request` columns to Cardinality Explorer to [show metric usage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#track-ingested-metrics-usage). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6145).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui relabeling playground](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#relabeling): enforce strict validation for `Labels` text area: it now accepts only labels enclosed in curly braces `{__name__=\"name\", label=\"value\"}`. See related [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8584).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: all the VictoriaMetrics components: properly detect `cgroupv2` [CPU limits](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#cpu). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8808) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly init [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) version for `linux/arm` and non-CGO buids. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6019) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): remote write client sets correct content encoding header based on actual body content, rather than relying on configuration. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8650).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): correctly update the `debug` param for recording rule when updating the rule group.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): properly set the rule group id in `/rules` and `/alerts` APIs. Previously, the group id was not set, preventing rules from being toggled by group in the vmalert UI. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8773).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup/) and [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): properly configure s3 client with if `configFilePath` is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8668) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup/), [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore/), [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager/): enable support of HTTP/2 for connections to S3-compatible storage endpoints. It was disabled in [v1.115.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.115.0) and could lead to connection errors with some S3-compatible storage providers.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix [metric query stats API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#track-ingested-metrics-usage) to correctly handle metric names longer than 256 bytes, respecting the `-maxLabelValueLen` flag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8759) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support `identity` value in `Content-Encoding` HTTP header. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8649).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): fix timeseries with empty timestamp and value in Datadog sketches API. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8649).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): restore write concurrency limiter for data ingestion. The limiter was unintentionally removed in [v1.115.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.115.0) and potentially could lead to increased memory usage in certain scenarios. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8742).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vmstorage` and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): allow using `-downsampling.period=filter:0s:0s` to skip downsampling for time series that match the specified `filter`. See [this doc](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix duplicated series in the legend on the Raw Query page when deduplication is disabled. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8688).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): respect `-http.pathPrefix` flag when requesting `/flags` API endpoint in vmui.

This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...) or by directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE/RKE1) will reach end of life on **July 31, 2025**. Rancher 2.12.0 and later will no longer support provisioning or managing downstream RKE1 clusters. We recommend replatforming RKE1 clusters to RKE2 to ensure continued support and security updates. Learn more about the transition [here](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021518).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** [Rancher-Istio](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/istio) will be deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the [SUSE Application Collection](https://apps.rancher.io) build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in [this announcement](https://forums.suse.com/t/deprecation-of-rancher-istio/45043)\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Review the Install/Upgrade Notes before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\nRancher v2.11.1 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. To learn more about Rancher Prime, see our page on the [Rancher Prime Platform](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher-platform).\r\n\r\nFor more information on new features in the general minor release see the [v2.11.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.0).\r\n\r\n## Changes Since v2.11.0\r\n\r\nSee the full list of [changes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/compare/v2.11.0...v2.11.1).\r\n\r\n## Security Fixes for Rancher Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following Rancher security issues:\r\n\r\n- An issue was found when using [Continuous Delivery with Fleet](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/fleet) where Fleet does not validate a server's certificate when connecting through SSH. This can allow for a main-in-the-middle-attack against Fleet. The fix provides a new `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` value for the `fleet` Helm chart. The default value is set to `true` (opt-in) for Rancher v2.9 - v2.11 for backward compatibility. The default value will be set to `false` (opt-out) for Rancher v2.12 and later, and Fleet v0.13 and later.\r\n  - If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `true`, then not finding any matching `known_hosts` entry for an SSH host will not lead to any error.\r\n  - If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `false`, then strict host key checks are enabled. When enabled, the checks ensure that when using SSH, Fleet rejects connection attempts to hosts not matching any entry found in (decreasing order of precedence):\r\n    - A secret referenced by name in a `GitRepo` which is located in the same `GitRepo's` namespace.\r\n      - If no such secret name is provided in a `gitcredential` secret located in the same namespace.\r\n    - A new `known-hosts` ConfigMap, created during the Fleet chart installation time and located in the namespace `cattle-fleet-system`.\r\n  For more information, see [CVE-2025-23390](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpc-q899-67p8).\r\n- A vulnerability was found where users could create a project and then gain access to arbitrary projects. As a fix, a new field has been added to projects called the `BackingNampespace`, which represents the namespace created for a project containing all resources needed for project operations. This includes resources such as ProjectRoleTemplateBindings, project-scoped secrets and workloads.\r\n  - The field is populated automatically during project creation and is formatted as `<clusterID>-<project.Name>`. For example, if your project is named `project-abc123` in a cluster with ID `cluster-xyz789`, then the project will have the `BackingNampespace`: `cluster-xyz789-project-abc123`. Existing projects will not be migrated and only newly created projects will have the new namespace naming convention.\r\n  For more information, see [CVE-2025-22031](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8h6m-wv39-239m).\r\n- A vulnerability was found where users with permission to create a service in the Kubernetes cluster where Rancher is deployed can take over the Rancher UI, display their own UI, and gather sensitive information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is set to `remote`. This release introduces a patch, and the malicious user can no longer serve their own UI. If users can't upgrade, please make sure that only trustable users have access to create a service in the local cluster. For more information, see [CVE-2025-32198](https://github.com/rancher/steve/security/advisories/GHSA-95fc-g4gj-mqmx).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) or in Rancher's [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories) repo.\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n\r\n### Rancher Kubernetes API\r\n\r\nRancher v2.8.0 introduced the Rancher Kubernetes API (RK-API). Our new RK-API\r\nlets you manage Rancher in the same way you manage Kubernetes. You can\r\nnow use the RK-API to interact with Rancher CRDs via\r\nKubernetes tooling. This includes convenient documentation via the\r\n`kubectl explain` command. A limited set of our most widely-used CRDs are\r\nalready supported, and our team is working to add more features on a\r\ncontinuous basis. For more information on RK-API, see the [RK-API quick start](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/api/quickstart) and [reference guide](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/api/api-reference).\r\n\r\nNote that while the [previous v3 Rancher API](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/api/v3-rancher-api-guide) is still available:\r\n\r\n- The v3 API is considered an internal API and is **not officially supported**.\r\n- No new features will be added to the v3 Rancher API going forward.\r\n- Customers should plan to re-write any automation built using this API to the new RK-API.\r\n\r\nSupport for UI plugins for cluster and node drivers based on the legacy Ember\r\nUI has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. These UI plugins should be migrated to the new UI Extensions mechanism. Follow this link for more [UI Extensions information](https://extensions.rancher.io/).\r\n\r\n## Frameworks\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixes an infinite loop caused when a certain watch operation was interrupted after some uptime (normally the watcher timeout). This prevents CPU and memory increase due to the rapid executions of the affected code. See [#49667](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/49667).\r\n\r\n## Observability and Backup\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- This release fixes a bug where when the Prometheus Federator pod is deleted, an install Helm job is triggered and the project monitor is recreated, and as a consequence data is lost. The fix introduces new values to the `prometheus-federator` chart. These values are important during pod startup and default values are provided. In case of a timeout error occurring during pod initialization you may need to adjust the values under [namespaceRegistration](https://github.com/rancher/prometheus-federator/blob/main/charts/prometheus-federator/values.yaml#L249) as documented in the chart itself. See [#48175](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48175).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.11.1\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.11.1](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.11.1)\r\n- RKE - [v1.8.2](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.8.2)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.32.3 (Default)\r\n- v1.31.7\r\n- v1.30.11\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.32.3 (Default)\r\n- v1.31.7\r\n- v1.30.11\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.28 and v1.29 are no longer supported. Before upgrading to Rancher v2.11.0, ensure all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.30 or later. See [#48628](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48628).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Replaced instances of v-tooltip with v-clean-tooltip to fix an issue where the UI did not sanitize cluster description inputs, allowing the possibility of changes to a cluster (local or downstream) description to cause a stored XSS attack. For more information, see [CVE-2024-52281](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-2v2w-8v8c-wcm9) and [#12564](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12564).\r\n  - The v2.11.0 release removed the data collection feature, which removed the [Rancher legacy telemetry](https://github.com/rancher/telemetry) and the subsequent `Opt-out of Telemetry` setting during set-up. Part of the legacy telemetry has been replaced with the SCC registration process for Prime, and the most important deployment metric is still tracked via the `system-charts` registry analysis. Going forward, telemetry will be gathered SUSE-wide. For more information, see [#12639](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12639).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Generic Kubernetes imported clusters now use the v3 management cluster object (`cluster.management.cattle.io`) for both the initial creation and the updates (POST and PUT API calls respectively). See [#13151](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/13151).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2/K3s Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - etcd snapshots are now populated to Rancher by listing the `etcdsnapshotfile.k3s.cattle.io` resources in the downstream cluster instead of periodically scraping the CLI and `rke2/k3s-etcd-snapshots` configmap. See [#44452](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44452#issuecomment-2762057052).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - CLI commands corresponding to the multi-cluster app legacy feature are no longer available. See [#48252](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48252).\r\n  - The deprecated subcommand `globaldns` was removed from the Rancher CLI. See [#48129](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48129).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - The `Restricted Admin` role has been removed. Existing users with the `Restricted Admin` role will have privileges associated with this role revoked upon upgrade. See [#47875](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47875).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Continuous Delivery (Fleet)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Fleet now honors custom certificate authority (CA) bundles [configured](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/helm-chart-options#additional-trusted-cas) in Rancher.\r\n\r\n    This prevents you from needing to copy your CA bundles to all `GitRepos` and/or Helm secrets referenced by those `GitRepos`. Instead, you can configure those bundles directly through a single secret already known by Rancher, which Fleet will transparently use as a fallback option.\r\n\r\n    See the [Fleet documentation](https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-add#using-custom-ca-bundles) and [fleet#2750](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/2750).\r\n\r\n  - Since the move from StatefulSet to a Deployment and the introduction of leader election for the agents, agent failover has improved. When failover has been tested by shutting down a node with a fleet agent, we observed the pods from that node to stay in the `terminating` state. We want to make sure that it is clear to our users, that this is not a problem of Fleet, nor is it Fleet related. This is how Kubernetes behaves when the node becomes unreachable. Failover works correctly, even if those pods are kept in the `terminating` state. See [fleet#3096](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/3096) and [kubernetes/kubernetes#72226](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72226).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - The Catalog v1, Multi-Cluster App (MCA) legacy feature has been removed. If upgrading from a previous Rancher version to v2.11 then the MCA associated CRD's and their instances will still exist in the cluster and can be manually deleted by using the following command:\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    kubectl delete crds catalogs.management.cattle.io catalogtemplates.management.cattle.io catalogtemplateversions.management.cattle.io templates.management.cattle.io templateversions.management.cattle.io templatecontents.management.cattle.io clustercatalogs.management.cattle.io projectcatalogs.management.cattle.io multiclusterapps.management.cattle.io multiclusterapprevisions.management.cattle.io apps.project.cattle.io apprevisions.project.cattle.io\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - `rancher-alerting-drivers` app now uses `rancher/kuberlr-kubectl`, improving how alerts are sent and received. See [#48849](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48849).\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#13655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/13655).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - After deleting a Namespace or Project in the Rancher UI, the Namespace or Project remains visible. As a workaround, refresh the page. See [#12220](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12220).\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2:**\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete.

timeout defaulting when identical values are present in timeout settings. (#15617, @skonto)\r\n\r\n### Uncategorized\r\n\r\n- Add the ability to use mountPropagation for volumeMounts, gated under kubernetes.podspec-volumes-mount-propagation (#15758, @elijah-rou)\r\n- Adding support for CSI (Container Storage Interface) volumes. This feature allows users to mount CSI-compatible storage volumes into their Knative service containers. It enables integration with enterprise storage solutions and cloud provider storage services that implement the CSI specification. The feature is behind the flag `kubernetes.podspec-volumes-csi`. (#15815, @mwritescode)\r\n- Autoscaling: ignore ScaleDownDelay if the revision is not reachable (#15831, @scottjmaddox)\r\n- Bump go-containerregistry to address issues with tag to digest resolution on EKS (#15754, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix golangci exclude config (#15775, @dsimansk)\r\n- Kubernetes min version is now v1.31 (#15774, @dprotaso)\r\n- Minimum Kubernetes version is now v1.31 (#15777, @dprotaso)\r\n- Support exec readiness probes for sidecar containers (#15773, @flomedja)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- github.com/containerd/log:

(ongoing)\r\n\r\nCurrently, we ask developers to set up their Java code mappings manually (because the SDK cannot determine it):\r\nhttps://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/source-context/#setting-up-code-mappings\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many stack traces do not contain in-app frames, thus, many Sentry features are not available (e.g. SCM linking, suspect commit).\r\n\r\nThis tracks using the code mappings derivation system to automatically add the code mappings and stack trace rules to mark in-app frames as such.\r\n\r\nThis will automatically enable the following Sentry features :\r\n- Suspect Commits\r\n- GitHub pull request comments\r\n- Auto-assignments (if Codeowners imported)\r\n- Stack trace linking\r\n- Code coverage (if the customer also has an account)\r\n\r\nThis will only be available to customers with the GitHub integration installed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the system

"https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.1.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "body": "RabbitMQ 4.1.0 is a new feature release.\r\n\r\nSee Compatibility Notes below to learn about **breaking or potentially breaking changes** in this release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nSome key improvements in this release are listed below.\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queue Throughput and Parallelism Improvements\r\n\r\nQuorum queue log reads are now offloaded to channels (sessions, connections).\r\n\r\nIn practical terms this means improved consumer throughput, lower interference of publishers\r\non queue delivery rate to consumers, and improved CPU core utilization by each quorum queue\r\n(assuming there are enough cores available to the node).\r\n\r\n### Initial Support for AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions\r\n\r\nSupport for the `properties` and `application-properties` filters of [AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 Working Draft 09](https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=66227).\r\n\r\nAs described in the [AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/12/13/amqp-filter-expressions) blog post,\r\nthis feature enables multiple concurrent clients each consuming only a subset of messages from a stream while maintaining message order.\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags Quality of Life Improvements\r\n\r\nGraduated (mandatory) [feature flags](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/feature-flags) several minors ago has proven that they could use some user experience improvements.\r\nFor example, certain required feature flags will now be enabled on node boot when all nodes in the cluster support them.\r\n\r\nSee core server changes below as well as the [GitHub project dedicated to feature flags improvements](https://github.com/orgs/rabbitmq/projects/4/views/1)\r\nfor the complete list of related changes.\r\n\r\n### rabbitmqadmin v2\r\n\r\n[`rabbitmqadmin` v2](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin-ng) is a major revision of the\r\noriginal CLI client for the RabbitMQ HTTP API.\r\n\r\nIt supports a much broader set of operations, including health checks, operations\r\non federation upstreams, shovels, transformations of exported definitions,\r\n(some) Tanzu RabbitMQ HTTP API endpoints, `--long-option` and subcommand inference in interactive mode,\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes and Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\n### Initial AMQP 0-9-1 Maximum Frame Size\r\n\r\nBefore a client connection can negotiate a maximum frame size (`frame_max`), it must authenticate\r\nsuccessfully. Before the authenticated phase, a special lower `frame_max` value\r\nis used.\r\n\r\nWith this release, the value was increased from the original 4096 bytes to 8192\r\nto accommodate larger [JWT tokens](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/oauth2).\r\n\r\nClients that do override `frame_max` now must use values of 8192 bytes or greater.\r\nWe recommend using the default server value of `131072`: do not override the `frame_max`\r\nkey in `rabbitmq.conf` and do not set it in the application code.\r\n\r\n### Node.js `amqplib` Must Be Upgraded\r\n\r\n[`amqplib`](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/) is a popular client library that has been using\r\na low `frame_max` default of `4096`. Its users must [upgrade to a compatible version](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0107)\r\n(starting with `0.10.7`) or explicitly use a higher `frame_max`.\r\n\r\n`amqplib` versions older than `0.10.7` will not be able to connect to\r\nRabbitMQ 4.1.0 and later versions due to the initial AMQP 0-9-1 maximum frame size\r\nincrease covered above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### MQTT\r\n\r\n * The default MQTT [Maximum Packet Size](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901086) changed from 256 MiB to 16 MiB.\r\n\r\n   This default can be overridden by [configuring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) `mqtt.max_packet_size_authenticated`.\r\n   Note that this value must not be greater than `max_message_size` (which also defaults to 16 MiB).\r\n\r\n### etcd Peer Discovery\r\n\r\nThe following `rabbitmq.conf` settings are unsupported:\r\n* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert`\r\n* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.dh`\r\n* `cluster_formation.etcd.ssl_options.dhfile`\r\n\r\n## Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\nThis release [requires Erlang 26.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) and supports Erlang 27.x.\r\n\r\n[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang#erlang-repositories) explains\r\nwhat package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x and 27.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Release Artifacts\r\n\r\nArtifacts are distributed via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases).\r\n\r\n[Community RabbitMQ image](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq) has a tag, `4.1`, that is\r\nperiodically updated to the latest patch in these series.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrading to 4.1.0\r\n\r\n### Documentation guides on upgrades\r\n\r\nSee the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) for documentation on upgrades and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)\r\nfor release notes of individual releases.\r\n\r\nThis release series supports upgrades from `4.0.x` and `3.13.x`.\r\n\r\n[Blue/Green Deployment](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/blue-green-upgrade)-style upgrades are avaialble for migrations\r\nfrom RabbitMQ `3.12.x` series.\r\n\r\n### New Required Feature Flags\r\n\r\nNone. The required feature flag set is the same as in `4.0.x`.\r\n\r\n### Mixed version cluster compatibility\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ 4.1.0 nodes can run alongside `4.0.x` nodes. `4.1.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster\r\nupgrade to 4.0.0 or a later patch release in the new series.\r\n\r\nWhile operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes will be covered in future updates.\r\nOnce all nodes are upgraded to 4.1.0, these irregularities will go away.\r\n\r\nMixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended\r\nperiods of time (no more than a few hours).\r\n\r\n### Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures\r\n\r\nThis version does not require any additional post-upgrade procedures\r\ncompared to other versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nThis section can be incomplete and will be expanded as 4.1 approaches its release candidate stage.\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue log reads are now offloaded to channels (sessions, connections).\r\n\r\n   In practical terms this means improved consumer throughput, lower interference of publishers\r\n   on queue delivery rate to consumers, and improved CPU core utilization by each quorum queue\r\n   (assuming there are enough cores available to the node).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12713](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12713)\r\n\r\n * Feature flag quality of live improvements.\r\n\r\n   Certain required feature flags will now be automatically required on node boot\r\n   and do not have to be explicitly enabled before an upgrade.\r\n   This does not apply to all feature flags, however.\r\n\r\n   GitHub project: [#4](https://github.com/orgs/rabbitmq/projects/4/views/1).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#12466](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12466), [#12444](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12444),\r\n                  [#12447](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12447)\r\n\r\n * `properties` and `appliation-properties` filters of [AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 Working Draft 09](https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=66227)\r\n    when consuming from a stream via AMQP 1.0. String prefix and suffix matching is also supported.\r\n\r\n    This feature adds the ability to RabbitMQ to have multiple concurrent clients each consuming only a subset of messages while maintaining message order.\r\n    It also reduces network traffic between RabbitMQ and clients by only dispatching those messages that the clients are actually interested in.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#12415](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12415)\r\n\r\n * Larger (up to 8192 bytes) [JWT tokens](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/oauth2) now can be used by AMQP 0-9-1 clients.\r\n\r\n   Before a client connection can negotiate a maximum frame size (`frame_max`), it must authenticate\r\n   successfully. Before the authenticated phase, a special lower `frame_max` value\r\n   is used.\r\n\r\n   Clients that do override `frame_max` now must use values of 8192 bytes or greater.\r\n   We recommend using the default server value of `131072`: do not override the `frame_max`\r\n   key in `rabbitmq.conf` and do not set it in the application code.\r\n\r\n   [`amqplib`](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/) is a popular client library that has been using\r\n   a low `frame_max` default of `4096`. Its users must [upgrade to a compatible version](https://github.com/amqp-node/amqplib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0107)\r\n   (starting with `0.10.7`) or explicitly use a higher `frame_max`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13541](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13541)\r\n\r\n *  AMQP 1.0 connections that use OAuth 2.0 now can renew their JWT tokens\r\n    This allows clients to set a new token proactively before the current one [expires](/docs/oauth2#token-expiration), ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.\r\n    If a client does not set a new token before the existing one expires, RabbitMQ will automatically close the AMQP 1.0 connection.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#12599](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12599)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 filters now have capped complexity: filtering on more than 16 properties\r\n   won't be possible. This is a protection mechanism recommended in the AMQP 1.0 spec.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13196](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13196)\r\n\r\n * Support for Multiple Routing Keys in AMQP 1.0 via `x-cc` Message Annotation.\r\n\r\n   AMQP 1.0 publishers now can set multiple routing keys by using the `x-cc` message annotation.\r\n   This annotation allows publishers to specify a [list](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-list)\r\n   of routing keys ([strings](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-string)) for more flexible message distribution,\r\n   similar to the [CC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/sender-selected) header in AMQP 0.9.1.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12559](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12559)\r\n\r\n * Support field `dynamic` of AMQP 1.0 [source](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-source) and [target](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-target).\r\n\r\n   This allows AMQP clients to dynamically create [exclusive queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues#exclusive-queues), which can be useful for RPC workloads.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13231](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13231)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue checkpoint algorithm was tweaked to take checkpoints more frequently, thus\r\n   clearing older segment files more aggressively.\r\n\r\n   Workloads that use larger messages should continue following [the documented recommendations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues#performance-tuning-large-messages) to\r\n   avoid large disk space footprint of segment files.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13622](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13622)\r\n\r\n * Previously a node that was a cluster member but then was [reset](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/clustering#restarting-with-hostname-changes) could not\r\n   rejoin the cluster if the [schema data store](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) was Mnesia.\r\n\r\n   Now the reset node will try to leave the cluster and retry rejoining again.\r\n   This was already the case for Khepri.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13643)\r\n\r\n * Nodes will now fall back to system CA certificate list (if available) when no CA certificate\r\n   is explicitly configured.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @LoisSotoLopez.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#10519](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10519), [#12564](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12564)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0-9-1 connections now dynamically adjust their TCP socket buffers.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13363](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13363)\r\n\r\n * Peer discovery resilience improvements.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#12801](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12801), [#12809](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12809)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue's [continuous membership reconciliation mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues#replica-reconciliation) (CMR) efficiency\r\n   and resilience improvements.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13703](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13703)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0-9-1 connections now produce more specific error messages when an incorrect data is sent\r\n   by the client during connection negotiation.\r\n\r\n   For example, when a [TLS-enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl) client connects to a non-TLS port, or an HTTP GET request is sent to the AMQP port.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13559](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13559)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 connections now use a higher pre-authentication maximum allowed frame limit size by default.\r\n   This means that [larger JWT tokens can be accepted](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/troubleshooting-oauth2) without any configuration.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13542](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13542)\r\n\r\n * Plugins now can mark queues and streams as protected from deletion by applications.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13525](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13525)\r\n\r\n * Internal API changes needed by a future version of the [message deduplication

[#13374](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13374)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue leadership transfer could take several seconds longer than necessary to complete.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13190](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13190)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue follow replica's last index could lag behind that of the leader.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13328](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13328)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 0-9-1 channel exception generator could not handle entity names (say, queue or stream names)\r\n   that contained non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\n   This affected applications that use passive queue declarations, such as the Shovel plugin.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @bpint.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12888](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12888)\r\n\r\n * Reintroduced transient flow control between classic queue replicas and AMQP 0-9-1 channels,\r\n   MQTT connections.\r\n\r\n   Flow control between these specific parts of the core were unintentionally\r\n   removed in `4.0.0` together with classic queue mirroring.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @gomoripeti.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12907](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12907)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 connections with a higher consumption rate could set the incoming window field\r\n   on the flow frame to a negative value, which resulted in an exception that affected the consumer.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#12816](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12816)\r\n\r\n * In rare cases quorum queue could end up without an elected leader because\r\n   chosen candidate replica was not verified for aliveness.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @Ayanda-D.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#12727](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12727), [#10423](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/10423), [#12701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/12701)\r\n\r\n * When a new replica is added to a quorum queue, the node that handles this request will now wait\r\n   the operation to complete. Previously an early return could result in confusing `cluster_change_not_permitted`\r\n   errors for subsequent operations, for example, an addition of another replica.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12837](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12837)\r\n\r\n * In a mixed version 4.0/3.13 cluster, dead lettering a message could fail.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12933](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12933)\r\n\r\n * In very rare cases, RabbitMQ could fail to notify stream consumers connected to follower replicas\r\n   about newly committed offsets as quickly as it usually happens for consumers connected to the stream leader.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12785](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12785)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Default cluster formation timeout with [Khepri](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) now matches that of Mnesia (5 minutes by default).\r\n\r\n   Discovered and reported by @evolvedlight.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13195](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13195)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues could return a list of members (replicas) with duplicates in some cases.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13168](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13168)\r\n\r\n * Classic queues with priorities could run into an exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13088](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13088)\r\n\r\n\r\n### MQTT Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * The default MQTT [Maximum Packet Size](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901086) changed from 256 MiB to 16 MiB.\r\n\r\n   This default can be overridden by [configuring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) `mqtt.max_packet_size_authenticated`.\r\n   Note that this value must not be greater than `max_message_size` (which also defaults to 16 MiB).\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmqctl force_reset` is **deprecated** as it is incompatible with Khepri,\r\n   which will become the default metadata store in RabbitMQ by 4.2.0.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13217](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13217)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * New major version of `rabbitmqadmin`, a CLI tool that targets RabbitMQ's HTTP API, has matured.\r\n   Unlike its predecessor, the tool is distirbuted via GitHub as as a standalone native binary.\r\n\r\n   There are minor command line interface changes and a slightly different configuration file\r\n   format ([TOML](https://toml.io/en/) instead of `ini`).\r\n\r\n   Documentation guide: []().\r\n\r\n   GitHub repository: [`rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin-ng`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin-ng)\r\n\r\n * New health check for detecting quorum queues without an elected leader.\r\n\r\n   ```shell\r\n   #

A comparable \"mega health check\"\r\n   has long been deprecated in CLI tools and was made a no-op in `4.0.0`.\r\n\r\n   This endpoint was using a [deprecated feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/deprecated-features): a classic non-exclusive transient (non-durable) queue.\r\n\r\n   See [Health Checks](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#health-checks) for modern focused alternatives.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13047](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13047)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Static assets served by the management UI now have a `control-cache` header set\r\n   to make sure that browsers reload them between upgrades.\r\n\r\n   UI code now tries to track version changes to perform a forced reload of the entire page.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12749](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12749)\r\n\r\n * Connection pages now display detailed AMQP 1.0 session and link information:\r\n\r\n   1. Link names\r\n   2. Link target and source addresses\r\n   3. Link flow control state\r\n   4. Session flow control state\r\n   5. Number of unconfirmed and unacknowledged messages\r\n   6. Busy incoming links are now highlighted\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#12670](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12670), [#13093](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13093)\r\n\r\n * The management UI now shows if a feature flag has a migration function (in other words, it may take time to be enabled),\r\n   if it is experimental and whether it is supported or not. To enable an experimental feature flag,\r\n   a user must to tick checkboxes to confirm they know what they are doing.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12643)\r\n\r\n * Feature flags are now enabled using asynchronous requests in the management UI.\r\n   This means that feature flags that perform data migrations (which can take some time)\r\n   won't block the browser tab.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12643](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12643)\r\n\r\n * The HTTP API and management UI now can use a [separate chain of authentication and authorization backends](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control).\r\n\r\n   This means that a separate list of backends can now be used for the messaging protocol clients and the HTTP API access.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @aaron-seo.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13465](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13465)\r\n\r\n * The UI now provides a dark theme.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @efimov90.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#13545](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13545), [#3478](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3478)\r\n\r\n * New health check commands help detect quorum queues without an elected leader.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   # verifies all quorum queues across all virtual hosts\r\n   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/all-vhosts/\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   # verifies all quorum queues in the given virtual host\r\n   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/vhost/{vhost}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   # verifies a subset of quorum queue that match the pattern across all virtual hosts\r\n   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/all-vhosts/pattern/{pattern}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   # verifies a subset of quorum queue that match the pattern in the given virtual host\r\n   GET /health/checks/quorum-queues-without-elected-leaders/vhost/{vhost}/pattern/{pattern}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Note that the values in the path must be percent-encoded, including the pattern.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13571](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13571)\r\n\r\n * Web app tab title now changes depending on the selected top-level tab.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13512](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13512)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Fixes a false positive that incorrectly reported deprecated feature use, specifically\r\n   the use of non-exclusive transient classic queues.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12840](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12840)\r\n\r\n * Nodes will fail to boot if `rabbit.credit_flow_default_credit` (an `advanced.config`-only, rarely used setting)\r\n   is set to an incompatible pair of values.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @JimmyWang6.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13046](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13046)\r\n\r\n * When a logged in user's JWT token was refreshed, the user identity displayed in the UI was changed.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12818](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12818)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stream Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Stream replication connections now can be configured to use IPv6 using `advanced.config`:\r\n\r\n   ```erl\r\n   [\r\n     {osiris, [\r\n        {replica_ip_address_family, inet6}\r\n     ]}\r\n   ].\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When a connection of one or more consumers in a [Single Active Consumer](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams#single-active-consumer) group failed,\r\n   the group could try to activate (promote) one of the consumers are are no longer online. In practical terms\r\n   this means that other consumers were not getting any deliveries.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13657](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13657)\r\n\r\n * A TCP connection to the stream protocol port that sent no data (e.g. a TCP load balancer check)\r\n   produced a harmless but scary looking exception in the log.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13674)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 AuthN and AuthZ Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations\r\n\r\n * The OAuth 2 plugin now requires several values to be explicitly configured by the user\r\n   and will not provide any defaults.\r\n\r\n   The affected identity providers are Azure Entra (n\u00e9 Azure AD) and auth0.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12235](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12235)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Scope aliases now can be configured in `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   ```ini\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.admin = tag:administrator configure:*/*\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.developer = tag:management configure:*/* read:*/* write:*/*\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ```ini\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.alias = api://administrator\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.1.scope = tag:administrator configure:*/*\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.alias = api://developer\r\n   auth_oauth2.scope_aliases.2.scope = tag:management configure:*/* read:*/* write:*/*\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12210](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12210)\r\n\r\n * Support for more complex JWT token structures, such as those sometimes used by Keycloak.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12324](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12324), [#13216](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13216)\r\n\r\n * [OpenID Discovery Endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest) now can be configured. This is particularly relevant for\r\n   Azure Entra (n\u00e9 Azure AD) users.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12211](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12211)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * JWT token refreshes will no longer affect the identity shown in the management UI.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12598](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12598)\r\n\r\n\r\n### LDAP Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * The `in_group_nested` query now uses case-insensitive matching, which is more typical of the LDAP tooling.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13629](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13629)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Exchange federation now can be used with MQTTv5 consumers.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13115](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13115)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Queue federation could cause a deadlock in a quorum queue replica process.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12713](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12713)\r\n\r\n * Federation status command and HTTP API endpoint could run into an exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13701)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * New Shovel metric: the number of forwarded messages.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13626](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13626)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * AMQP 0-9-1 channel exception generator could not handle entity names (say, queue or stream names)\r\n   that contained non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\n   This affected applications that use passive queue declarations, such as the Shovel plugin.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @bpint.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12888](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12888)\r\n\r\n * The shutdown sequence of Shovel connections and AMQP 1.0 sessions is now safer.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2596](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2596)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Event Exchange Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * The `rabbitmq_event_exchange` plugin now can be configured to internally publish AMQP 1.0 instead of AMQP 0.9.1 messages to the `amq.rabbitmq.event` topic exchange.\r\n\r\n   This allows AMQP 1.0 consumers to receive event properties containing complex types such as [lists](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-list)\r\n   or [maps](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-map), for example queue arguments for the `queue.created`\r\n   event or client provided properties for the `connection.created` event.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12714](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12714)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AWS Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Avoids an exception during automatic removal of cluster members that are\r\n   no longer returned by peer discovery (an [opt-in feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/cluster-formation#node-health-checks-and-cleanup)).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12809](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12809)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * This plugin was significantly reworked to further reduce the probability of\r\n   two (or more) clusters being formed in a small percentage of cases when\r\n   the entire cluster was started for the first time.\r\n\r\n   The plugin no longer relies on the Kubernetes API and instead will try to join\r\n   the first (indexed at `0`) node as the seed node.\r\n\r\n   This change is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13050](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13050)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n *

Consul Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `cluster_formation.registration.enabled` is a new configuration setting that allows the backend to skip registration.\r\n\r\n   This is useful when Consul is used for peer discovery but a different tool such as Nomad\r\n   is used to keep track of the services and their registration, unregistration.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by

See [Parameter settings for limiting the number of namespaces in the appld+cluster dimension](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_64-parameter-settings-for-limiting-the-number-of-namespaces-in-the-appldcluster-dimension) and [Limitation on the number of configuration items in a single namespace](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_65-limitation-on-the-number-of-configuration-items-in-a-single-namespace).\r\n\r\n### Cluster-Level Permission Control Support\r\nUsers can now configure editing and publishing permissions for namespaces based on cluster granularity.

In previous versions of Packer, the\n      data sources were evaluated first, then the local variables were, making\n      it impossible to have a datasource that referenced a local variable as\n      part of its configuration.\n      This change introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to evaluate those\n      resources, instead of the phased approach of old, which makes the order\n      of evaluation not dependent on the type of resource, but instead of the\n      detected dependencies between them.\n      **Note**: While we are confident this should be robust enough for general\n      use, we do recognise that it is possible some users might encounter issues.\n      To give those users a way to continue using the old evaluation method, we\n      introduced a `-use-sequential-evaluation` command-line flag to the build,\n      validate, console and inspect subcommands, to force using the sequential\n      evaluation approach for those entities.\n      [GH-13155](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13155)\n\n* core/hcp: support for uploading SBOMs to HCP Packer.\n      Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) are a standardised way to export the various\n      software packages linked to an artifact. As some users have expressed a\n      need to produce and access those for images they build, we now add the\n      feature to Packer itself.\n      While the generation of the SBOM itself is not done directly by\n      Packer, instead we recommend using known scanners to produce them, we add\n      the capacity to upload this SBOM file to HCP Packer, and link it to a\n      build artifact.\n      [GH-13171](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13171)\n\n* core: support for alternate serialisation formats for plugin communication.\n      Packer relies on plugins to do most of the actual workload related to\n      building and provisioing artifacts, while Packer is mostly an orchestrator\n      for those plugins to perform their work.\n      This separation of concerns implies that both entities have to\n      communicate on multiple occasions during the course of a build.\n      Before v1.12.0 of Packer, and v0.6.0 of the plugin SDK, we used Gob to\n      do most of the serialisation for those steps.\n      This is however a bit of a problem recently, as go-cty, the library we\n      use for dynamic objects lifted from HCL templates, dropped support for\n      this a while back.\n      Therefore now, we introduce an alternative: protobuf/msgpack, which are\n      both usable and maintained by the projects around Packer, so we can begin\n      our transition away from gob with this change.\n      **Note**: as with the introduction of the DAG for locals/datasources, this\n      is a feature that we are reasonably confident you will not encounter bugs\n      with, however we cannot rule-out this possibility, therefore we introduce\n      a new environment variable: `PACKER_FORCE_GOB`, which if set to '1', forces\n      the use of Gob instead of protobuf/msgpack.\n      [GH-13120](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13120)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* hcl2/json: add `aws_secretsmanager_raw` funcion.\n      When using the AWS secretsmanager function with a non-text secret, one could\n      only get a secret once at a time.\n      This could get cumbersome if wanting to get multiple through one request,\n      which led people to encode their JSON/Object secrets as a big base64\n      encoded string that they could get once, and then manipulate through JSON\n      functions.\n      While the workaround works, it is one extra layer of manipulations to do so,\n      therefore a new function to always get the raw textual version of a secret\n      is now added to Packer.\n      [GH-13242](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13242)\n* hcl2: add `alltrue` and `anytrue` functions.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL functions `alltrue` and\n      `anytrue`, which returns whether or not a collection only consists of\n      `true` values, or if any is.\n      [GH-13237](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13237)\n* hcl2: add `strcontains` function.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL function `strcontains`,\n      which returns whether or not a string contains a substring within it.\n      [GH-13217](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13217)\n      [GH-13222](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13222)\n* datasource/http: Support other methods than GET.\n      The HTTP datasource used to always use GET requests for getting data\n      from a remote HTTP server, which was not always enough since some endpoints\n      may only support other methods. This change allows for most of the HTTP\n      methods to perform those requests.\n      [GH-13190](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13190)\n* hcl2: add `base64gzip` function.\n      In some cases, small blobs may need to be kept in memory, and injected in\n      a template somewhere else, but if the blob needs to be minimised, the\n      base64gzip function can be invoked to compress the blob and expose it\n      as a valid HCL2 string for use later.\n      [GH-13142](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13142)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n\n* hcl2: Fix duplicate error messages on top-level HCL violations.\n      A parsing quirk for HCL templates caused Packer to produce the same parsing\n      error multiple times if the error was caused by a top-level violation.\n      [GH-13245](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13245)\n* build: Include LC_UUID in Darwin binaries.\n      A change in how Apple authorises a plugin to access the network caused\n      Packer to break on recent (14.7 and above) macOS versions, as Packer uses\n      the local network to communicate with plugins.\n      The fix is to include an additional UUID into the metadata of the produced\n      binary, so it is authorised by macOS to use the local network, which prompts\n      an update to the version of Go used for building Packer (1.22.9), as it is\n      when this addition is supported by an LDFLAG.\n      [GH-13214](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13214)\n* hcl2: Don't error on empty bucker slug.\n      As reported by members of our community, using a hcp_packer_registry\n      block without a bucket slug, even if provided by external means, would cause\n      Packer to fail with an invalid bucket slug error. This is most definitely\n      a bug, which is addressed in this release.\n      [GH-13210](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13210)\n* hcp: fix bug when trying to extract HEAD SHA from empty Git repo.\n      [GH-13165](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13165)\n\n### SECURITY:\n\n* Bump to go-crypto v0.31.0\n      [GH-13233](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13233)\n\n### NOTES:\n\n* docs: fix UUIDv4 example. A community user has found discrepancies in the\n      UUIDv4 examples which were used in our docs, as they do not match the\n      standard.\n      [GH-13229](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13229)\n* hcl2: fix slice initialisation method during variable evaluation phase.\n      [GH-13175](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13175)\n\n", "created_at": "2025-01-22T15:13:57Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "KubeEdge v1.20.0 release", "tag_name": "v1.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/releases/tag/v1.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge", "body": "See [CHANGELOG-1.20.md](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md) for details.", "created_at": "2025-01-21T12:40:26Z", "project": "KubeEdge", "repo": "kubeedge/kubeedge", "type": "Edge", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.0", "tag_name": "v1.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/bfenetworks/bfe/releases/tag/v1.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/bfenetworks/bfe", "body": "### Added\r\n\r\n- Support building docker images for multiple architectures\r\n- Support WASM to allow dynamic plugin\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Upgrade versions of some third-paty modules for security reasons\r\n- Fix format issue in bfe_http/request_test.go\r\n- Temporarily remove some test cases using legacy test data\r\n- mod_tcp_keepalive: fix broken unit tests\r\n- http2: close connections when receiving too many headers\r\n- Fix readloop goroutine leak\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- The previous experimental dynamic plugin is deprecated", "created_at": "2025-01-19T13:56:01Z", "project": "BFE", "repo": "bfenetworks/bfe", "type": "Load Balancing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.35.0", "tag_name": "v1.35.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.35.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

before you upgrade\r\n\r\n- Action required\r\n  Change `kubeadm_patches` format to use an array of inline patch instead of patch files.\r\n  See [the example](roles/kubernetes/kubeadm_common/defaults/main.yml) for new format. (#11521, @VannTen)\r\n - Action required\r\n  Removes the generation of static tokens for every node in the cluster when `kube_token_auth: true` (#11567, @VannTen)\r\n - Action required\r\n  The `kubelet_node_{config_extra_args,custom_flags}` are removed. Use `kubelet_{config_extra_args,custom_flags}` in `<your_inventory>/group_vars/kube_node.yml`.\r\n  The `{kube,system}_master_{cpu,memory,ephemeral-storage,pid}` are removed. Use the `{kube,system}_{cpu,memory,ephemeral-storage,pid}` variables in `<your_inventory>/group_vars/kube_control_plane.yml.\r\n  `kubelet_custom_flags` can no longer be a string, an array is required. (#10643, @VannTen)\r\n - Action required\r\n  `k8s_cluster` group is now automatically defined, it can be removed from your inventory if you're not using it for group_vars (#11559, @VannTen)\r\n - Action required\r\n  `kubeadm_ignore_preflight_errors` is introduced to ignore specific preflight checks from kubeadm. The previous was effectively `all`, so some errors might surface during upgrade, in which cases, users should add the ones they choose to ignore to that variable.
