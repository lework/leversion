Upgrading kops to 1.18.0 (or the latest versions of the 1.15, 1.16, 1.17 or 1.18 series) and running `kops update` followed by a `kops rolling-update` will fix the issue.  Please see [the advisory](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/advisories/etcd-manager-certificate-expiration/) for the full details.\r\n\r\n---\r\nkops 1.18.0 is the first stable release in the 1.18 series of kops, offering support for kubernetes 1.18.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/releases/1.18-NOTES.md) for the full list of changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Release notes for kops 1.18 series\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n* **The default image has been updated to Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)**. Consequently, the SSH user changed to `ubuntu` and the Linux kernel changed to version 5.4.\r\n\r\n* To address the [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) of IPv4 only clusters being susceptible to MitM attacks via IPv6 rogue router advertisements, the affected components have been upgraded as follows:\r\n    * Docker version 19.03.11 - [CVE-2020-13401](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/v19.03.11)\r\n    * CNI plugins 0.8.6 - [CVE-2020-10749](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/tag/v0.8.6)\r\n    * Calico 3.15.1 - [CVE-2020-13597](https://www.projectcalico.org/security-bulletins/)\r\n    * Weave Net 2.6.5 - [CVE-2020-11091](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/security/advisories/GHSA-59qg-grp7-5r73)\r\n\r\n* Support for [RHEL 8](../operations/images.md#rhel-8) and [CentOS 8](../operations/images.md#centos-8) has been added.\r\n\r\n* Support for Amazon Linux 2 has been improved and will work with the default Docker version.\r\n\r\n* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md) has been added and can be selected as an alternate container runtime for Kubernetes. Enable by using the `--container-runtime containerd` flag when creating a cluster or by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd`.\r\n\r\n* Rolling updates now support surging and parallelism within an instance group. For details see [the documentation](../operations/rolling-update.md).\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use AWS networking natively through the AWS ENI IPAM mode. Kops can also run a Kubernetes cluster entirely without kube-proxy using Cilium's BPF NodePort implementation.\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use a dedicated etcd cluster managed by etcd-manager for synchronizing agent state instead of CRDs.\r\n\r\n* The Terraform target now supports Terraform 0.12 syntax (HCL2) by default. See the Required Actions item below.\r\n\r\n* New clusters in GCE are configured to run the [metadata-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metadata-proxy) by default. The proxy runs as a DaemonSet and lands on nodes with the nodeLabel `cloud.google.com/metadata-proxy-ready: \"true\"`. If you want to enable metadata-proxy on an existing cluster/instance group, add that nodeLabel to your instancegroup specs (`kops edit ig ...`) and run `kops update cluster`. When the changes are applied, the proxy will roll out to those targeted nodes.\r\n\r\n* GCE has a new flag: `--gce-service-account`. This takes the email of an existing GCP service account and launches the instances with it. This setting applies to the whole cluster (ie: it is not currently designed to support Instance Groups with different service accounts). If you do not specify a service account during cluster creation, the default compute service account will be used which matches the prior behavior.\r\n\r\n* Google API client libraries updated from v0.beta to v1.\r\n\r\n* Support for [NodeLocalDNS cache](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cluster_spec/#node-local-dns-cache).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker versions 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 has been removed because of the [dockerproject.org shut down](https://www.docker.com/blog/changes-dockerproject-org-apt-yum-repositories/). Those affected must upgrade to a newer Docker version.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename some resources in their state file in order to prepare for Terraform 0.12 support. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the CoreOS OS distribution has been removed. Users should consider Flatcar as a replacement.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Debian 8 (Jessie) OS distribution has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Docker `health-check` service is now disabled by default. It shouldn't be needed anymore, but it can still be enabled by setting `spec.docker.healthCheck: true`. It is recommended to also check [node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) and [draino](https://github.com/planetlabs/draino) as replacements. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Lyft CNI plugin default subnet tags changed from from `Type: pod` to `KubernetesCluster: myclustername.mydns.io`. Subnets intended for use by the plugin will need to be tagged with this new tag and [additional tag filters](https://github.com/lyft/cni-ipvlan-vpc-k8s#other-configuration-flags) may need to be added to the cluster spec in order to achieve the desired set of subnets.\r\n\r\n* Support for basic authentication has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and will be [removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89069) in Kubernetes 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for static tokens has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and later. To re-enable, see the [Security Notes for Kubernetes](../security.md). We intend to remove support entirely in a future kops version, so file an issue with your use case if you need this feature. \r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the \"Legacy\" etcd provider has been removed for Kubernetes versions 1.18 and higher. Such clusters will need to migrate to the default \"Manager\" etcd provider. To migrate, see the [etcd migration documentation](../etcd3-migration.md).\r\n\r\n* A controller is now used to apply labels to nodes.  If you are not using AWS, GCE or OpenStack your (non-master) nodes may not have labels applied correctly.\r\n\r\n* The `kops.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API has been removed. Users of `kops replace` will need to supply v1alpha2 resources.\r\n\r\n* Please see the notes in the 1.15 release about the apiGroup changing from kops to kops.k8s.io\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename resources in their terraform state file in order to support Terraform 0.12.\r\n  Terraform 0.12 [no longer supports resource names starting with digits](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html#pre-upgrade-checklist). In Kops, both the default route and additional VPC CIDR associations are affected. See [#7957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/7957) for more information.\r\n  * The default route was named `aws_route.0-0-0-0--0` and will now be named `aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0`.\r\n  * Additional CIDR blocks associated with a VPC were similarly named the hyphenated CIDR block with two hyphens for the `/`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16`. These will now be prefixed with `cidr-`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16`.\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```\r\n  KOPS_FEATURE_FLAG=-Terraform-0.12 kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform <0.12\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Observe any aws_route or aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association resources being destroyed and recreated\r\n  # Run these commands as necessary. The exact names may differ; use what is outputted by terraform plan\r\n  terraform state mv aws_route.0-0-0-0--0 aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0\r\n  terraform state mv aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16 aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n  Kops will now output Terraform 0.12 syntax with the normal workflow:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform 0.12. This plan should be a no-op\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Users that need the Docker `health-check` service will need to explicitly enable it:\r\n```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    docker:\r\n      healthCheck: true\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. This is required for newer versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n  To enable the Pod priority feature, follow these steps:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    kubelet:\r\n      featureGates:\r\n        PodPriority: \"true\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If a custom Kops build was used on a cluster, a kops-controller Deployment may have been created that should get deleted.\r\n  Run `kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment kops-controller` after upgrading to Kops 1.16.0-beta.1 or later.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.9 and 1.10 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## All changes from v1.18.0-beta.2 to v1.18.0\r\n\r\n\r\n* Use stable names for GH workflow jobs [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9552](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9552)\r\n* Use fixed UID for etcd user and restrict to legacy provider [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#9581](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9581)\r\n* Promote Ciprian & John to approvers [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9590](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9590)\r\n* Prefer nodes with \"master\" role for Calico Typha pods [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9609](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9609)\r\n* Docs helptext [@olemarkus](https://github.com/olemarkus) [#9333](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9333)\r\n* Add Ubuntu 20.04 support for Docker 18.06.3 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9616](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9616)\r\n* Calico: Upgrade the \"k8s-ec2-srcdst\" controller to version v0.3.0 [@seh](https://github.com/seh),[@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9647](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9647)\r\n* Update Calico to v3.15.1 for k8s 1.16+ [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9656](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9656)\r\n* Prefer nodes with \"master\" role for Canal Typha pods [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9663](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9663)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/releases/1.18-NOTES.md) for the full list of changes. \r\n", "created_at": "2020-08-02T20:16:01Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.15.0 \"Ragamuffin R2-D2\"", "tag_name": "v0.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 Cloud Events, `Run` CRD,  more variables and better docs \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.15.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.15.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.15.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.15.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.15.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n\r\nNone this time.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Use cloud event native retries for cloud event pipeline resource (#3003)\r\nCloud events sent via `CloudEventPipelineResource` now use retries with backoff.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Add pipeline run support for cloud events (#2938)\r\nAdd cloud events for pipeline runs via the  configuration option `default-cloud-events-sink`.\r\nWhen the default sink is setup, cloud events are sent, else they're disabled.\r\n\r\nSend cloud events (when enabled) from the pipeline run and controller, for all non-error\r\nevents that are already notified via k8s events.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Add Default TaskRun Workspace Bindings to config-default (#2930)\r\nUsers can now set a default `Workspace` configuration for any `Workspaces` that a Task declares but that a TaskRun does not explicitly provide.

volumes ([#7130](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7130)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would sometimes HTML-escape special characters in its CLI output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman start --attach --interactive` command would print the container ID of the container attached to when exiting ([#7068](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/7068)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman run --ipc=host --pid=host` would only set `--pid=host` and not `--ipc=host` ([#7100](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7100)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--publish` argument to `podman run`, `podman create` and `podman pod create` would not allow binding the same container port to more than one host port ([#7062](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7062)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where incorrect arguments to `podman images --format` could cause Podman to segfault.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman rmi --force` on an image ID with more than one name and at least one container using the image would not completely remove containers using the image ([#7153](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7153)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where memory usage in bytes and memory use percentage were swapped in the output of `podman stats --format=json`.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat events endpoints would fail if no filters were specified ([#7078](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7078)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `CgroupVersion` field in responses from the compat Info endpoint was prefixed by \"v\" (instead of just being \"1\" or \"2\", as is documented).\r\n", "created_at": "2020-07-31T19:54:09Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time":

easier creation of Consul Agent tokens. [[GH-7970](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/7970)]\n* agent: Added Consul client agent automatic configuration utilizing JWTs for authorizing the request to generate ACL tokens, TLS certificates and retrieval of the gossip encryption key.

[[GH-7628](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/7628)]\n* agent: new configuration options allow ratelimiting of the agent-cache: `cache.entry_fetch_rate` and `cache.entry_fetch_max_burst`. [[GH-8226](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8226)]\n* cli: Output message on success when writing/deleting config entries. [[GH-7806](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/7806)]\n* connect: Append port number to expected ingress hosts [[GH-8190](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8190)]\n* dns: Improve RCODE of response when query targets a non-existent datacenter. [[GH-8102](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8102)],[[GH-8218](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8218)]\n* version: The `version` CLI subcommand was altered to always show the git revision the binary was built from on the second line of output. Additionally the command gained a `-format` flag with the option now of outputting the version information in JSON form. **NOTE** This change has the potential to break any parsing done by users of the `version` commands output. In many cases nothing will need to be done but it is possible depending on how the output is parsed. [[GH-8268](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8268)]\n\nBUGFIXES:\n\n* agent: Fixed a bug where Consul could crash when `verify_outgoing` was set to true but no client certificate was used. [[GH-8211](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8211)]\n* agent: Fixed an issue with lock contention during RPCs when under load while using the Prometheus metrics sink. [[GH-8372](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8372)]\n* auto_encrypt: Fixed an issue where auto encrypt certificate signing wasn't using the connect signing rate limiter. [[GH-8211](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8211)]\n* auto_encrypt: Fixed several issues around retrieving the first TLS certificate where it would have the wrong CN and SANs. This was being masked by a second bug (also fixed) causing that certificate to immediately be discarded with a second certificate request being made afterwards. [[GH-8211](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8211)]\n* auto_encrypt: Fixed an issue that caused auto encrypt certificates to not be updated properly if the agents token was changed and the old token was deleted. [[GH-8311](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8311)]\n* connect: fix crash that would result if a mesh or terminating gateway's upstream has a hostname as an address and no healthy service instances available [[GH-8158](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8158)]\n* connect: Fixed issue where specifying a prometheus bind address would cause ingress gateways to fail to start up [[GH-8371]](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/8371)\n* gossip: Avoid issue where two unique leave events for the same node could lead to infinite rebroadcast storms [[GH-8343](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8343)]\n* snapshot: **(Consul Enterprise only)** Fixed a regression when using Azure blob storage.\n* xds: version sniff envoy and switch regular expressions from 'regex' to 'safe_regex' on newer envoy versions [[GH-8265](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8265)]\n\n", "created_at": "2020-07-30T22:08:52Z", "project": "Consul", "repo": "hashicorp/consul", "type": "Discovery", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.10.0rc4", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/3900f82d00b652a76d4f529f6b98d12968bd2bd9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.10.0rc4", "created_at": "2020-07-30T21:17:16Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "2.1.121", "tag_name": "v2.1.121", "html_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/v2.1.121", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx", "body": "To install jx 2.1.121 see the [install guide](https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/)\n\n### Linux\n\n```shell\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v2.1.121/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv \nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n```shell\nbrew tap jenkins-x/jx\nbrew install jx\n```\n## Changes\n\n### Chores\n\n* Make the linter happy by using an interface (Andrew Bayer)\n* add \"make mod\" target for Lighthouse to call (Andrew Bayer)\n* Switch to lighthouse.git for lighthouse config pkg (Andrew Bayer)\n\n", "created_at": "2020-07-30T17:10:40Z", "project": "JenkinsX", "repo": "jenkins-x/jx", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.7.0", "tag_name": "0.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/0.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kuma", "body": "We are happy to announce the general availability of Kuma 0.7!

The old default was \u201cdiscoverygateway\u201d. To use the old gateway, specify the flag in the command line. Anyone already using the flag will see no change; to use the new gateway, remove the -gateway_implementation flag. The new gateway is simpler and uses a new healthcheck module with no loss of functionality. #6155\r\n\r\n* VTGate: VTGate incorrectly returned Warning Code field name as Type. This has now been fixed. Code or scripts that depend on the incorrect behavior might break.  #6437\r\n\r\n* VReplication: The \"-cell\" parameter to MoveTables has been renamed to \u201c-cells\u201d, since it now accepts multiple comma-separated cells or cellsAliases. The parameter specifies which cells can provide tablets as the source for vreplication streams. #6456\r\n\r\n* VTGate: The possibility of sending OpenTracing trace spans through query comments has been changed. The old way of doing it was severely broken, so our assumption is that no-one has successfully been using this feature. Still, this is an API change, and we are reporting it as a breaking change. #6463\r\n\r\n* VTTablet has been refactored to be generally more responsive to state changes and its environment: #6131 #6139 #6241 #6263 #6311 #6345 #6348 #6384 #6396 #6432 #6461\r\n\r\n    * Some initialization parameters are now mandatory: init_keyspace, init_shard and init_tablet_type. The flow where you could issue a vtctlclient InitTablet and then invoke vttablet without those init parameters is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n    * Consequently vtctl's InitTablet and UpdateTabletAddrs are deprecated.\r\n\r\n    * demote_master_type is deprecated: Now that init_tablet_type is mandatory, that value can act as the demote_master_type. There is no need for a separate flag.\r\n\r\n    * VTTablet will publish the discovered MySQL port on startup, and will not update it during the life of the process. There is no known use case where a MySQL port is expected to change. So, there is no need to keep polling MySQL for its port.\r\n\r\n    * Decouple enable_replication_watcher from disable_active_reparents. Currently, vttablet attempts to fix replication only if enable_replication_watcher is true and disable_active_reparents is false. This behavior has changed to depend only on the disable_active_reparents flag.\r\n\r\n    * Transitioning from a serving type to SPARE used to go through a brief lameduck period specified by the serving_state_grace_period (default 0). This has been removed. The transition will now happen immediately even if a grace period is specified.\r\n\r\n    * It was possible to enable health reporting and heartbeat at the same time. Performing the two at the same time is not useful. As of this release, enabling heartbeat automatically disables the polling mode of checking for replica health.\r\n\r\n    * The ACL rules used to be reported on the vttablet status page. The design was using an incorrect framework. This has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Build: make targets \"build_web\" and \u201cembed_static\u201d have been removed. Instead there are new targets \u201cweb_bootstrap\u201d, \u201cweb_build\u201d and \u201cweb_start\u201d #6473\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* The following vtctl commands have been deprecated. Deprecated commands will continue to work until the next release (8.0).  #6428 #6345 #6461\r\n\r\n    * StartSlave -> Replaced with StartReplication\r\n\r\n    * StopSlave -> Replaced with StopReplication\r\n\r\n    * ChangeSlaveType -> Replaced with ChangeTabletType\r\n\r\n    * InitTablet\r\n\r\n    * UpdateTabletAddrs\r\n\r\n* Various vtctl commands had a flag called \"-wait_slave_timeout\". It has been replaced with \u201c-wait_replicas_timeout\u201d. Scripts using the old flag will continue to work until the next major release (8.0).  #6428\r\n\r\n* Helm charts: The current helm charts have not been keeping up with the forward progress in vitess, and there has been no maintainer for it. Additionally, the operator has pulled ahead of what the helm charts could do. The operator can also be functionally more versatile than the helm charts because custom code can be written to manage complex workflows. To maintain focus and velocity in the project, we are deprecating the helm charts. #6439\r\n\r\n* Consul: The usage of Consul has been problematic for vitess users. The main difficulty comes from the fact that it's non-trivial for a multi-cell deployment. Due to this, we want to discourage the use of consul as a topo server, and are deprecating support for it. #6440\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n### VTGate / MySQL compatibility\r\n\r\n* Handle non-keyword tokens FORMAT, TREE and VITESS. (This was broken by #6110) #6445\r\n\r\n* When using user-defined variables that have not been initialized first, a non-fatal panic occurs and the connection is dropped. #6294 #6308\r\n\r\n* Setting system variable panics vtgate. #6162 #6163\r\n\r\n* regression: USE does not work from MySQL client. #6153 #6157\r\n\r\n* USE does not return an error if a keyspace doesn't exist. #3060 #6157\r\n\r\n* Dotted table names are not escaped properly in lookup vindex flow. #6142 #6145\r\n\r\n* Produce correct error code (1105 instead of 1062) when inserting duplicates into consistent_lookup vindex. #6144\r\n\r\n* Rewriting expressions fail when used as function parameters. #6281\r\n\r\n* Rollback after error clobbers updates. #6285\r\n\r\n* Queries should not be wrapped into transactions if **autocommit=1** is set. #6264\r\n\r\n* Prepared statements with bind variables in column specification produce \u2018missing bind var\u2019 error. #6287 #6298\r\n\r\n* Prepared statement queries returning NULL results are not  parsed. #6240 #6249\r\n\r\n* DEFAULT function not working with status column. #6221 #6224\r\n\r\n* VTGate panic kills connection when selecting database() when using OLAP workload. #6200 #6205\r\n\r\n* Wrong column value can be inserted due to parameterization variable confusion. #6266 #6270\r\n\r\n* Fix owned table name formatting and duplicate error code in consistent lookup. #6145\r\n\r\n* Support for case-insensitive user defined variables. #6225\r\n\r\n* Fix performance regression on VTGate. #6203\r\n\r\n* Return NULL for non-existent user-defined variables. #6308\r\n\r\n* MySQL connection closing should not inflate query counts. #6226\r\n\r\n* show vitess_shards intermittently returns empty list. #5038 #5189\r\n\r\n* Protect insert lookup queries from bind variable name clashes #6328\r\n\r\n* CAST/CONVERT should work correctly #6304\r\n\r\n* Allow charset introducers for vindex columns #6301\r\n\r\n* Fix panic from EXPLAIN #6204\r\n\r\n* Handle special comments that start with ! #6186\r\n\r\n* Fix panic with uppercase types #6140\r\n\r\n* Allow \u2018$\u2019 in identifiers #6136\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Etcd query timeout because auto-committable transactions are not properly rolled back. #6258 #6299\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Fixed race in schema engine during notification of schema changes. #6268\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Reloading ACL config was throwing misleading error messages.his has now been fixed and the error messages improved. #6309\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Panic during backup caused an error in the pgzip library has been fixed by contributing a fix to pgzip and upgrading to a new release that includes the fix. #6189\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Improvement of error handling by retrying while uploading to S3. #6182 #6395 #6405\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: builtinbackupengine was uploading a manifest despite errors from S3. Error collection during backup has been fixed to address this. #6349 #6350\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Fix dba connection leak in LockTables. #6424\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Fix connection pool leak in schema engine. #6426\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Fix regression where a heartbeat interval flag setting of 1s would have resulted in an internal value of 1000s #6356 #6357\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Fix panic from binlog_streamer when \u2018-watch_replication_stream\u2019 is set., #6253\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Add context to MysqlDaemon schema functions. This lets us handle disconnected RPCs instead of the client hanging forever. #6243\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: fix panic from txlogz #6238\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Add back support for millisecond values for flags that was dropped when yaml config was introduced #6250\r\n\r\n* Vtctld UI: Change all external links in vitess to use https #6170 #6169\r\n\r\n* Ensure SrvVSchema gets rebuilt for all cells #6276\r\n\r\n* Fix MariadbGTIDSet multi-domain support #6184\r\n\r\n* mysqlctl: Fix connection leak during killConnection() #6245\r\n\r\n* Fix release script to install examples in the correct directory #6159\r\n\r\n* examples/operator: fix port-forward command #6418\r\n\r\n* VStream client: should send current position events immediately #6391 #6397\r\n\r\n## Functionality Added or Changed\r\n\r\n### VTGate/ MySQL compatibility\r\n\r\n* Transactions on read-only replicas are now supported. Start a transaction by first choosing the desired tablet_type (\"use keyspace@replica\"), then issuing a \u201cBEGIN\u201d statement. Internally, this will issue a \u201cSTART TRANSACTION READ ONLY\u201d on the underlying database. This is only available if using the new gateway_implementation of tabletgateway (which is now the default).  #6166 #6244\r\n\r\n* Create better plans for NULL comparisons. Instead of using a SelectScatter, now vtgate will produce empty results when the predicate is a comparison against literal NULLs. #6133 #6425\r\n\r\n* Support IN, NOT IN and equality (=) with null values #6152 #6146\r\n\r\n* Add EXPLAIN support for vtgate plans. View the produced vtgate query plan by using explain format=vitess #6110\r\n\r\n* Allow users to perform savepoint related constructs. #6355 #6404 #6412 #6414\r\n\r\n* Added support for user-level advisory lock functions like get_lock and release_lock. This is considered experimental and will be improved in future releases based on user feedback. #6367 #6370 #6470\r\n\r\n* Allow users to change system variable settings at session level using set statements. This is a major change that was merged later in the development cycle. It is considered experimental and there may be edge cases. #6107 #6459 #6472 #6488\r\n\r\n* \"ignore_nulls\" option to lookup vindexes #6147 #6222:  There are situations where the \"from\" columns of a lookup vindex can be null. Such columns cannot be inserted in the lookup due to the uniqueness constraints of a lookup. The new \u201cignore_nulls\u201d option of the lookup vindex allows you to accommodate null values in rows. Such rows can still be found through other means, like the primary vindex.\r\n\r\n* Add support for row_count() function. #6174 #6179\r\n\r\n* XOR Operator is now supported. #6369 #6371\r\n\r\n* Allow 'binary' for character_set_results. It is equivalent to null. #6237\r\n\r\n* Improve logging by adding keyspace, table, and tablet_type. #6282\r\n\r\n* VTGate now takes in optional flags for \u2018max_payload_size\u2019 and \u2018warn_payload_size\u2019. A payload size above the warning threshold will only produce a warning. A payload size that exceeds \u2018max_payload_size\u2019 will result in an error. The default behavior is not to check payload size, which is backwards-compatible. #6143 #6375\r\n\r\n* A new comment directive (\u2018/*vt+ IGNORE_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE=1 */) has been added to provide the ability to override the payload size checking per query. #6143\r\n\r\n* A new comment directive (\u2018/*vt+ IGNORE_MAX_MEMORY_ROWS=1 */) has been added to provide the ability to ignore the \"-max_memory_rows\" setting per query. #6430\r\n\r\n* Support \u2018select * from information_schema.processlist\u2019. #6310\r\n\r\n* Support batch lookup queries for integer and binary types. Other types will continue to require one query per row. #6420\r\n\r\n* Support system settings at session level. #6149\r\n\r\n* Prepare for future features by adding reserved connections. This is the ability for a connected client to have a dedicated connection instead of using the connection pool. #6303 #6313 #6402 #6441 #6451\r\n\r\n* Allow charset introducers with vindex column values. #6236 #6314\r\n\r\n* Support Union All between different shards. #6351\r\n\r\n* Exclude KeyspaceId(s) from plan cache key.This improves the cache hit rate. #6233\r\n\r\n* Reload TLS config on SIGHUP. #6215\r\n\r\n* Drop vindex DDL. #6151\r\n\r\n* show vitess_tablets now reports master_term_start_time. We ensure that this is reported correctly after reparents. #6135 #6292 #6293\r\n\r\n* Allow parenthesized selects #6342\r\n\r\n* Support DO statements #6239\r\n\r\n* Support calling database() inside other functions #6291\r\n\r\n* Support IN, NOT IN and equality (=) with null values #6152 #6146\r\n\r\n### VReplication\r\n\r\n* VStream Copy extends the VStream API to allow streaming of the contents of databases or tables. Earlier you had to specify a position to start streaming events from. #6277\r\n\r\n* VReplication workflows now accept \"-cells\" as an option. This can be a comma-separated list of cells or cellsAliases. The source tablet for vreplication will be chosen randomly among the tablets that belong to the specified cells/cellsAliases. If the option is not provided, we default to the cell that is local to the vreplication target. #6442, #6456 #6465\r\n\r\n* Schema Versioning. Tablets now have a schema tracker that can be enabled to store schema versions as DDLs are applied. The _vt.schema_version table contains the schema with the corresponding ddl and gtid position when the ddl was applied. The tracked schemas are used by the new Historian service to provide vstreams with the correct schema while streaming old events. #6300 #6164 #6278 #6399 #6411 #6435 #6448\r\n\r\n* Support for specifying multiple external sources to facilitate migration into vitess.\r\n\r\n* Foreign Keys are now supported on the target database during vreplication. In the copy phase we disable FK checks and re-enable them once the replication phase starts. #6284\r\n\r\n* Materialize: added a drop_constraint option during table copy to strip constraints while creating target tables #6422\r\n\r\n* Materialize: optimizations while creating target tables resulting in a significant improvement in performance when moving a large number of tables from an external MySQL instance #6207, #6251\r\n\r\n* DropSources: Added \u2018-rename_tables\u2019 option to rename the source tables rather than dropping them entirely. #6383\r\n\r\n* Savepoints: Vreplication streams are not able to handle savepoint events in the binlog. #6438\r\n\r\n* Add keyspace, shard and workflow labels to VReplicationSecondsBehindMaster metrics #6279\r\n\r\n* Correct command line help for MigrateServedTypes, MigrateServedFrom and SwitchWrites #6187\r\n\r\n* VExec and Workflow commands have been added to vtctld as a layer above VReplicationExec. They allow listing/stopping/starting/deleting workflows and ability to run custom queries on the _vt.vreplication table for all shards in a workflow. #6410\r\n\r\n### Point-in-time Recovery\r\n\r\nIn the 4.0 release we introduced functionality to recover a keyspace into a snapshot based on a specified time. That feature only allowed you to restore a backup, but did not have the ability to automatically replay binlogs up to the specified time. The feature has now been completed so that true point-in-time recovery is possible. This is currently only supported for MySQL compatible installations, not MariaDB. #4857 #6267 #6408\r\n\r\n### Healthcheck\r\n\r\n* VTGate can now use a new healthcheck that is logically simpler while providing the same functionality. This is the default. The older healthcheck has been deprecated but is still available to use if desired by setting \"-gateway_implementation=discoverygateway\" #5750 #6155\r\n\r\n* VTCombo has been migrated to use the new healthcheck #6302\r\n\r\n* VTExplain has been migrated to use new healthcheck #6460\r\n\r\n### MiniVitess\r\n\r\nA docker container that can be used to bring up a self-contained vitess cluster, which can automatically resolve and self-configure to meet an external MySQL cluster. While this might sound very similar to VTCombo and vttestserver, it is not quite the same. \r\n\r\nMiniVitess spins up in docker. Given a MySQL server hostname, schema name & credentials, it runs an automated topology analysis via orchestrator, identifying the cluster members. It proceeds to bring up distinct tablet for each server and opens up vtgate connections. #6377\r\n\r\n### Examples / Tutorials\r\n\r\n* Vitess operator example #6154\r\n\r\n* Region sharding example #6209 #6275\r\n\r\n* Change local example to use new command DropSources #6178\r\n\r\n* Are-you-alive example now makes it easier to test multiple endpoints #6202\r\n\r\n* Local docker tutorial added to website\r\n\r\n* Simplified helm chart for examples (however, helm is now deprecated) #6168\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n* vtctlclient ListAllTablets now shows the MasterTermStartTime. This is shown as \"<null>\" for read-only tablet types. In case of an old master that has not yet updated the topo record, TabletType will be reported as \u201cunknown\u201d #6135\r\n\r\n* New debug handlers have been added to enable/disable golang block and mutex profiling. #6137\r\n\r\n* Vitessdriver: Allow overriding driver name. Default stays as \"vitess\" #6138\r\n\r\n* VTCombo: add options to allow starting MySQL within VTCombo. Note that vttestserver provides similar functionality. #6265\r\n\r\n* Disable foreign key checks during preflight schema change tests #4696\r\n\r\n* Fix labels for opentsdb #6289\r\n\r\n* Allow empty shards when running ValidateSchemaKeyspace behind flag \u2018-skip-no-master\u2019 #6216\r\n\r\n* Death by SIGPIPE on stdout/stderr can be avoided by setting the new flag \u2018catch-sigpipe\u2019 #6297\r\n\r\n* Prepared Statement support added when using special vitess construct of use `<keyspace>:<shard>` by adding GetField support in engine plan execute #6132\r\n\r\n* GTIDSet Union #6180\r\n\r\n* Add relay log position and file based positions to ReplicationStatus #6217\r\n\r\n* Function that can find errant GTIDs #6296\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Add StopReplicationMode to StopReplicationAndGetStatus RPC #6335\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: DemoteMaster RPC returns full status instead of string representation of current position #6365\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: WaitForPosition RPC can now accept either file-based or GTID-based positions #6374\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* Fix links to local example and sample client in vitessdriver godoc #6254\r\n\r\n* Flag documentation has been improved #6261\r\n\r\n* All flags are now documented in the [program reference](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/programs/) on the website.\r\n\r\n## Build Environment Changes\r\n\r\n* golangci-lint now runs as a pre-commit hook and CI check #6385 #6406\r\n\r\n* CI test for region_sharding example #6275\r\n\r\n* Removed staticcheck as a pre-commit hook because it is included in golangci-lint #6416\r\n\r\n* Faster unit tests #6415\r\n\r\n* Consul-api version upgraded to 1.8.0 #6358\r\n\r\n* Upgrade pgzip to v1.2.4 #6189\r\n\r\n* Upgrade log4j2 version to 2.13.3 #6403\r\n\r\n* Upgrade netty version to 4.1.48.Final #6317\r\n\r\n* Upgrade tcnative version to 2.0.30.Final #6317 \r\n\r\n* Add docker_local target to Makefile and a docker/local/run.sh script #6393\r\n\r\n* Only check for k3s on Linux #6353\r\n\r\n* UI build tooling was broken, it has now been fixed. #6473\r\n\r\n## Functionality Neutral Changes\r\n\r\n* Refactor table filtering logic #6242 #6259\r\n\r\n* VTGate: Replace Sprintf with string concatenation in normalizer, this reduces CPU usage on benchmarks #6127\r\n\r\n* VTTablet: Reduce the number of packets sent from vttablet to MySQL #6130\r\n\r\n* Fixed flakiness in External Connector Test: fixed race #6201\r\n\r\n* Fixed flakiness in Message Test: test had not been updated after jitter functionality was added #6283\r\n\r\n* Fix flakiness in TestConnectTimeout #6188\r\n\r\n* Fix TLS test for Go 1.13+ #6185\r\n\r\n* Fixed linter errors #6416 #6364 #6307\r\n\r\n* More dollar-sign tests #6363 \r\n\r\n* VTExplain: use DiscoveryGateway (and old healthcheck) until migration can be completed #6248\r\n\r\n* Deprecated RPCs from 6.0 have been deleted #6380\r\n\r\n* Update references to orchestrator repo to point to openark instead of github #6360\r\n\r\n* Terminology: deprecate or replace references to \"slave\" with \u201creplica\u201d except where referring to actual sql commands or fields returned from MySQL. #6428 #6392 #6379\r\n\r\n* Terminology: replace user-facing references to \"slave\" with \u201creplica\u201d or \u201creplication\u201d in UI #6481\r\n\r\n* Fix log format - use Infof instead of Info #6413\r\n\r\n* Cleanup temp files used in tests #6400\r\n\r\n* Add unit test for func stringMapToString #6280\r\n\r\n* Check errors in etcd2topo unit test #6128\r\n\r\n* Unit test for atomic.go #6120\r\n\r\n* Unit test for ResolveIPv4Addrs #6230\r\n\r\n* Enabled set statement tests #6167\r\n\r\n* Replaced VTTablet ExecuteBatch api call with Execute for autocommit query. #6407 #6431\r\n\r\n* Fixed flaky TestQueryPlanCache #6454\r\n\r\n* Fix test compile errors #6434\r\n\r\n* Scatter_conn unit test using new healthcheck #6458\r\n\r\n* Test that vtexplain works with healthcheck #6252\r\n\r\n* Tests: Removed error check that caused spurious test failures #6462\r\n\r\n* More test cases for IGNORE_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE #6467\r\n\r\n* VSCopy Test: Mods/bug fixes/test logging to make test repeatable/debuggable, fix flakiness #6341 #6235\r\n\r\n* Cleanup scatter conn #6257\r\n\r\n* Simplify vtgate executor #6256\r\n\r\n* Add tests for SHOW COLUMNS #6192\r\n\r\n* Added fuzzer #6175\r\n\r\n* Simplified TxPool and ConnPool code #6150\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2020-07-28T12:42:25Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Teleport 4.3.2", "tag_name": "v4.3.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v4.3.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport", "body": "This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n* Reverted base OS in container images to Ubuntu.

It contains a couple of backports\r\nfrom the `3.8.x` branch.\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ `3.7.x` series are out of general support and covered by the [limited extended support policy](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html) only.\r\n\r\nPlease consider [upgrading](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) to [RabbitMQ `3.8.x`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html).\r\n\r\n### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\nThis release [**no longer supports Erlang/OTP 20.3**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbitmq-users/G4UJ9zbIYHs/qCeyjkjyCQAJ).\r\nErlang `21.3+` is now a **hard requirement** checked on node startup.\r\n\r\nMake sure a [supported Erlang version](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) is used before upgrading.\r\n[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains\r\nwhat package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\n#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x or later** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.\r\nSince CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,\r\nRabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.\r\n\r\n#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log\r\n\r\nSee [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade\r\nand compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.\r\n\r\nSee the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades\r\nand [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nAny questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the\r\n[RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * More peer discovery errors are retried.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1627](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1627)\r\n\r\n * Initial Erlang/OTP 24 compatibility.\r\n\r\n   Erlang/OTP 24 is expected to ship in mid-2021. While RabbitMQ 3.7 will be [out of support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html) by then,\r\n   some initial compatibility work was backported to this branch due to contious integration on Erlang/OTP master.\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * One-off connections periodically used by exchange federation links now handle timeouts in certain\r\n   operations gracefully. This avoids unnecessary link disruption and restarts in certain environments.\r\n   The default interval has also been bumped from 30s to 90s.\r\n\r\n   In environments with stable topologies the interval can be significantly increased to decrease connection\r\n   churn, simplify monitoring and in general conserve some resources:\r\n\r\n   ``` erlang\r\n   %% advanced.config\r\n   [\r\n    {rabbitmq_federation, [\r\n        %% 86400 seconds or 24 hours\r\n        {internal_exchange_check_interval, 86400000}\r\n    ]}\r\n   ].\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#107](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/pull/107)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source code archives\r\n\r\n**Warning**: The source code archive provided by GitHub only contains the source of the broker,\r\nnot the plugins or the client libraries.

Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes. \r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup. \r\n \r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper. \r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11.

One tier includes 100% traces at a short (an hour or less) TTL. Later are normal sampling, either via a rate limit or low percentage. Some sites even have a tier that never expires. In such setups, there is tension. For example, the 100% tier is great for customer support as they can always see traces. However, the traces can expire in the middle of the incident! who wants a dead link?! Even normal trace storage is typically bounded by 3-7 day TTL. This becomes troublesome in issue trackers like Jira as the link is again, not permanent.\r\n\r\nThis problem is not as simple as it sounds. For example, it might seem correct to add tiering server-side. However, not all storage even support a TTL concept! Plus, multi-tiered storage is significantly more complex to reason with at the code abstraction vs the HTTP abstraction. @drolando from Yelp detailed these pros and cons, as well false starts [here](https://github.com/openzipkin/openzipkin.github.io/wiki/Favorite-trace).\r\n\r\nThe ultimate solution by Daniele, and adopted by the Zipkin team in general, was to leverage HTTP as opposed to bind to specific implementation code. In other words, everything is handled in the browser. This allows the archive target to not only be Zipkin, but anything that speaks its format including clones and vendors.\r\n\r\nYou can now set the following properties to add an \"Archive Trace\" button\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nZIPKIN_UI_ARCHIVE_POST_URL=https://longterm/api/v2/spans\r\nZIPKIN_UI_ARCHIVE_URL=https://longterm/zipkin/trace/{traceId}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are intentionally different as some vendors have a different read back expression than zipkin, even when their POST endpoint is the same.\r\n\r\nWhen you click archive, you'll see a message like below confirming where the trace went, in case you want to copy/paste it into your favorite issue tracker.\r\n\r\n<img height=\"200\" alt=\"archive\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3317638/77031832-fc10f200-695f-11ea-8b3d-910cb18b2d3f.png\">\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @drolando for making this feature a reality, as well @anuraaga @jcchavezs @jeqo @shakuzen and @tacigar who gave feedback that led to the polished end state.\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Elasticsearch Credentials\r\n\r\nOur Elasticsearch storage component has supported properties based changes to credentials since inception. While few knew about it, this didn't imply env variables, as file based always worked. Even with this flexibility, those running a non-buffered transport (like Kafka) would drop data when there's a password change event. This is incidentally routinely the case as HTTP and gRPC are quite common span transports. @basvanbeek noticed that even though the server restarts quickly (seconds or less), this drop is a bad experience. It is becoming commonplace for file-based updates to push out through services like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), and the restart gap could be tightened.\r\n\r\n@hanahmily stepped in to make reading passwords more dynamic, something pretty incredible to do for a first-time committer! At the end of 2 weeks of revisions, Gao landed a very simple option that covers the requirements, closing the auth-fail gap to under a second.\r\n\r\n* ES_CREDENTIALS_FILE: An absolute path of the file.\r\n* ES_CREDENTIALS_REFRESH_INTERVAL: Refresh interval in seconds.\r\n\r\nThanks very much to @anuraaga and @jorgheymans for all the feedback and teamwork to get this together.\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n\r\n* @jorgheymans added instructions for running lens [behind a reverse proxy](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-lens#running-behind-a-reverse-proxy)\r\n* @tacigar @anuraaga @drolando fixed a few UI glitches\r\n* `ES_ENSURE_TEMPLATES=false` is now available for sites who manage Elasticsearch schema offline\r\n* `ZIPKIN_UI_DEPENDENCY_ENABLED=false` is now available for sites who will never run zipkin-dependencies", "created_at": "2020-04-15T06:05:40Z", "project": "Zipkin", "repo": "openzipkin/zipkin", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.2", "tag_name": "1.7.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/releases/tag/1.7.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel", "body": "In this version, we've brought breaking changes about the slot SPI mechanism. The slot chain builder SPI has been deprecated (legacy classes were reserved for compatibility). Now Sentinel will take `ProcessorSlot` itself as SPI. Note that the slot might be stateful, so Sentinel will still build different new slot chains for each resource.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a new Logger SPI mechanism is introduced for flexible logging extension. The default RecordLog implementation is still based on `java.util.logging`, and developers could introduce dependencies of logging integration module to adapt to existing logging libraries (e.g. slf4j). See [here](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Logs#record-log) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Features / Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Add SOFARPC adapter module
