See [crio.conf.5.md](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/docs/crio.conf.5.md#crioimage-table) for more details. (#7082, @saschagrunert)\n\n#### Uncategorized\n - Adds debug log to identify when a relabel was not requested (#6961, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Failure in a PostStop hook does not prevent proper termination of a container anymore. (#7037, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug where network metrics collection is broken with systemd cgroup driver and dropped infra containers. (#6873, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug where sending information to cadvisor is stalled on taking the container's state lock (#7034, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug where the PostStop runtime handler hooks weren't being called when a container exited gracefully (#7085, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug where the `cpu-quota.crio.io` annotation was not propagated to the pod cgroup, meaning cpu quota was not disabled for the container (#6937, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug with cpu quota annotation that manifests like:\n  `pod with cpu-quota.crio.io: disable fails with error: set CPU CFS quota: invalid slice name: /kubepods.slice`\n  Fix a bug where stopped containers break cpu load balancing being disabled (#7012, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fixed bug where CRI-O runs with umask of `0`. (#6851, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Updating pause image to 3.9 (#6987, @sohankunkerkar)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Added\n- github.com/checkpoint-restore/go-criu/v4:

Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n> For the definition of stable or latest release, please check [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).\r\n\r\n  - [v2 Data Engine based on SPDK - Preview](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5751)\r\n    > **Please note that this is a preview feature, so should not be used in any production environment. A preview feature is disabled by default and would be changed in the following versions until it becomes general availability.**\r\n    \r\n    In addition to the existing iSCSI stack (v1) data engine, we are introducing the v2 data engine based on SPDK (Storage Performance Development Kit). This release includes the introduction of volume lifecycle management, degraded volume handling, offline replica rebuilding, block device management, and orphaned replica management. For the performance benchmark and comparison with v1, check the report [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.5.0/spdk/performance-benchmark/).\r\n\r\n  - [Longhorn Volume Attachment](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3715)\r\n    Introducing the new Longhorn VolumeAttachment CR, which ensures exclusive attachment and supports automatic volume attachment and detachment for various headless operations such as volume cloning, backing image export, and recurring jobs.\r\n\r\n  - [Cluster Autoscaler - GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5238)\r\n    Cluster Autoscaler was initially introduced as an experimental feature in v1.3. After undergoing automatic validation on different public cloud Kubernetes distributions and receiving user feedback, it has now reached general availability.\r\n\r\n  - [Instance Manager Engine & Replica Consolidation](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5208)\r\n    Previously, there were two separate instance manager pods responsible for volume engine and replica process management. However, this setup required high resource usage, especially during live upgrades. In this release, we have merged these pods into a single instance manager, reducing the initial resource requirements.\r\n\r\n  - [Volume Backup Compression Methods](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5189)\r\n    Longhorn supports different compression methods for volume backups, including lz4, gzip, or no compression. This allows users to choose the most suitable method based on their data type and usage requirements.\r\n\r\n  - [Automatic Volume Trim Recurring Job](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5186)\r\n    While volume filesystem trim was introduced in v1.4, users had to perform the operation manually. From this release, users can create a recurring job that automatically runs the trim process, improving space efficiency without requiring human intervention.\r\n\r\n  - [RWX Volume Trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5143)\r\n    Longhorn supports filesystem trim for RWX (Read-Write-Many) volumes, expanding the trim functionality beyond RWO (Read-Write-Once) volumes only.\r\n\r\n  - [Upgrade Path Enforcement & Downgrade Prevention](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5131)\r\n    To ensure compatibility after an upgrade, we have implemented upgrade path enforcement. This prevents unintended downgrades and ensures the system and data remain intact.\r\n\r\n  - [Backing Image Management via CSI VolumeSnapshot](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5005)\r\n    Users can now utilize the unified CSI VolumeSnapshot interface to manage Backing Images similar to volume snapshots and backups.\r\n\r\n  - [Snapshot Cleanup & Delete Recurring Job](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3836)\r\n    Introducing two new recurring job types specifically designed for snapshot cleanup and deletion. These jobs allow users to remove unnecessary snapshots for better space efficiency.\r\n\r\n  - [CIFS Backup Store](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3599) & [Azure Backup Store](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1309)\r\n    To enhance users' backup strategies and align with data governance policies, Longhorn now supports additional backup storage protocols, including CIFS and Azure.\r\n\r\n  - [Kubernetes Upgrade Node Drain Policy](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3304)  \r\n    The new Node Drain Policy provides flexible strategies to protect volume data during Kubernetes upgrades or node maintenance operations. This ensures the integrity and availability of your volumes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before installing Longhorn v1.5.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher App Marketplace, Kubectl, and Helm.

Backwards compatibility with older OpenTelemetry Collector versions can be achieved through the following flags:\r\n  * `prometheus.query.normalize-calls`: If true, normalizes the \"calls\" metric name. e.g. \"calls_total\".\r\n  * `prometheus.query.normalize-duration`: If true, normalizes the \"duration\" metric name to include the duration units. e.g. \"duration_milliseconds_bucket\".\r\n\r\n#### New Features\r\n* [Cassandra] Add Configuration.Close() to ensure TLS cert watcher is closed ([@kennyaz](https://github.com/kennyaz) in [#4515](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4515))\r\n* Add *.kerberos.disable-fast-negotiation option to Kafka consumer ([@pmuls99](https://github.com/pmuls99) in [#4520](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4520))\r\n* Support Prometheus normalization for specific metrics related to OpenTelemetry compatibility ([@albertteoh](https://github.com/albertteoh) in [#4555](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4555))\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements\r\n\r\n* Add readme for memstore plugin ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [283bdd9](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/commit/283bdd93cbb4a467842625d8eb320722fcb83494))\r\n* Pass a wrapper instead of `opentracing.Tracer` to ease migration to OTEL in the future [part 1] ([@afzalbin64](https://github.com/afzalbin64) in [#4529](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4529))\r\n* [hotROD] Add OTEL instrumentation to customer svc ([@afzal442](https://github.com/afzal442) in [#4559](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4559))\r\n* [hotROD] Replace gRPC instrumentation with OTEL ([@afzal442](https://github.com/afzal442) in [#4558](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4558))\r\n* [hotROD]: Upgrade `redis` service to use native OTEL instrumentation ([@afzal442](https://github.com/afzal442) in [#4533](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4533))\r\n* [hotROD] Fix OTEL logging in HotRod example ([@albertteoh](https://github.com/albertteoh) in [#4556](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4556))\r\n* [hotrod] Reduce span exporter's batch timeout to let the spans be exported sooner ([@GLVSKiriti](https://github.com/GLVSKiriti) in [#4518](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4518))\r\n* [tracegen] Add options to generate more spans and attributes for additional use cases ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [#4535](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4535))\r\n* Build improvement to rebuild jaeger-ui if the tree does not match any tag ([@bobrik](https://github.com/bobrik) in [#4553](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4553))\r\n* [Test] Fixed a race condition causing unit test failure by changing the logging  ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [#4546](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4546)) resolves [#4497](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/4497)\r\n\r\n\r\n### UI Changes\r\n\r\n* UI pinned to version [1.31.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v1310-2023-07-05).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-07-06T20:38:11Z", "project": "Jaeger", "repo": "jaegertracing/jaeger", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "23.6.2", "tag_name": "23.6.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.6.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry", "body": "### Escalating Issues V1 (ongoing)\n\nThis will allow marking an issue as archived until escalating.\n\nBy: @scttcper (#51765, #51852, #52048, #51766, #51735, #51671, #51158, #51185, #51187)\n\n### Grouping Release (2023-01-01 config)\n\nAdded new language/platform specific stack trace grouping enhancements rules that should make the default grouping experience better.

See [#41113](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41113) for more details. See the upstream Kubernetes [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Docker 23.0 Support\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\nSupport for Docker 23.0 has been added. See [#40731](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40731) for more details. See the upstream Docker [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/23.0/) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Improved Install Process for Kubernetes v1.25 and Above\r\n\r\nRancher versions 2.7.2 through 2.7.4 require users to set `global.cattle.psp.enabled` to `false` to install on Kubernetes versions 1.25 and above. Rancher will now attempt to detect if a cluster is running a Kubernetes version where PSPs are not supported, and default usage of PSPs to `false` if it can determine that PSPs are not supported in the cluster. Users can still manually override this by explicitly providing `true` or `false` for this value. Rancher will still use PSPs by default in clusters which support PSPs, such as clusters running Kubernetes versions 1.24 or lower.\r\n\r\nIf you install Rancher with PSPs enabled on a cluster which doesn't support PSPs, such as by overriding this value to `true` when installing the chart, you may experience issues when attempting to uninstall Rancher, which can leave resources behind. In these cases, you should run the [Rancher cleanup tool](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cleanup) to remove any left-over artifacts of Rancher, and complete the uninstall process. See [#41455](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41455) for more details.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n<!-- team/mapps -->\r\n- Increased the refresh time to 6 hours when updating the Rancher charts Helm repository. This mitigates timeout errors on git.rancher.io during Rancher releases. See [#40805](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40805).\r\n- You can now select Okta groups from the **Member Roles** dropdown under **Cluster Settings**. See [#38029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38029) for more details.\r\n- Added customization support for scheduling fields and resource limits for the cluster agent, and for the cluster's Fleet agent. You can use this feature to modify cluster tolerations, affinity rules, and resource requirments. See [#41035](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41035) and the [Rancher documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-server-configuration) (under *Cluster Agent Configuration and Fleet Agent Configuration* for your respective Kubernetes distribution).\r\n\r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- The Advanced Worker now supports the `management` and `rancher` stores, and  handles socket management and event processing within a Web Worker . See [#8837](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8837).\r\n- You can view a list of resources for projects with a single request by filtering by one or more projects or namespaces. See [#7618](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7618).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Disabled a feature that caused a significant memory increase in both Rancher and downstream clusters. See [#41379](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41379).\r\n<!-- team/area2, area/harvester, area/provisioning-v2 -->\r\n- Fixed an issue where, during an upgrade of RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the first node would be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling was disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n<!-- team/area1, area/ingress, area/server-chart -->\r\n- Added the `--set service.type: NodePort` Helm setting. This resolves an issue where clusters that used the default GKE ingress but didn't use VPC-native mode were incompatible with `cattle-system/rancher`. See [#16061](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16061).\r\n- Fixed an issue where, when removing finalizers from a provisioning cluster object, there was a race condition between adding the finalizers back and the generating framework that deletes the generated `rkecluster`, `rkecontrolplane`, `cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io` and `machinedeployment`s. See [#41887](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41887).\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\n- The `v1.24.14+k3s1`, `v1.25.10+k3s1`, and `v1.26.5+k3s1` K3s versions added in Rancher v2.7.5 fix an issue where Ingress wasn't working on certain K3s clusters following an upgrade. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/7586#issuecomment-1555414626) for earlier Kubernetes versions. See [#41582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41582). \r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Rancher now installs the same pinned version of the rancher-webhook chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Note that restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions ideally need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n- The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n- When you edit RKE1 clusters with defined Cluster agent or Fleet agent configurations, removing these values and adding new ones to the same section results in the new values not being saved. Editing the cluster and setting the new values again will correctly apply the change. See [#9003](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9003).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n<!-- team/rke2 -->\r\n- When you upgrade a Windows RKE2 cluster, the upgrade gets stuck on the Windows node and is unable to complete. Some logs indicate that RKE2 is unable to restart because the process is currently being used. See [#41868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41868).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter (such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later), upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0, which supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command, to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the privileged flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n- The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s now respects the `managedBy` annotation. Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround in its initial release to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false` since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n- Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n- Privilege escalation is now disabled by default when creating deployments. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n- Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n  - Rancher now aggregates the changed counts and only send a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n  - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, causing significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n- When provisioning downstream clusters, the cluster name must now conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n- In previous versions, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging, instead of Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some  necessary actions within Azure AD. This will cause errors.\r\n- Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters. The default behavior has been changed, so that if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.5\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.6](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.6)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.26.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.9\r\n- v1.24.13\r\n- v1.23.16\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.26.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.10\r\n- v1.24.14\r\n- v1.23.17\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Major Issues\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.7.2, a webhook will now be installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher >= v2.7.2 to a version < v2.7.2, you'll experience an issue where the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after Rancher version < v2.7.2 is running) to remove the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE and RKE2:**\r\n    - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n    - The `fleet-agent` pod fails to deploy on an upgraded RKE2 Windows Custom cluster. See [#993](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/993).\r\n  - **RKE2 and K3s:**\r\n    - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).\r\n    - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n        - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n        - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - Clusters are in an `Updating` state even when it contains nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020029) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n    - If you have downstream private GKE clusters, you might experience issues when interacting with the resources that the webhook validates, such as namespaces. This can cause problems with activities where Rancher needs to interact with those resources, such as when you install charts. As a [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142#issuecomment-1505624756), add a firewall setting to allow traffic to the webhook. See [#41142](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Authentication:**\r\n    - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after configuring another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup annotation with the unlocked value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. During an upgrade, this is a benign error and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - - When enabling some custom node drivers, the Cloud Credential creation page does not show the correct default fields and has an uneditable foo key. See [#8563](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8563).\r\n  - You need to force-refresh the Rancher UI after initial Rancher setup, to trigger the prompt to accept the self-signed certificate. As a workaround, visit the Rancher portal, accept the self-signed certificate, and go through the setup process. Once done, go to the address bar of your browser and click the lock icon. Select the option to allow you to receive certificate errors for the Rancher website. You'll then be prompted again to accept the new certificate. See [#7867](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7867).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n  - Remove legacy feature multi-cluster app. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-06-29T02:19:26Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.6.1", "tag_name": "v2.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.6.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "This release introduces several bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n* Set replicas: 1 automatically when HA is not enabled https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/4079\r\n* Fix dashboard panic when exec delete action by finish_time https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/4100", "created_at": "2023-06-28T07:50:08Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v18.1.2", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ceph/ceph/commits/a5c951305c2409669162c235d81981bdc60dd9e7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ceph/ceph", "body": "18.1.2\n\nSigned-off-by: Ceph Release Team <ceph-maintainers@ceph.io>", "created_at": "2023-06-27T19:59:59Z", "project": "Ceph", "repo": "ceph/ceph", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3.1.2", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openvswitch/ovs/commits/91677744752e67b147aa9ac6b0bef528bb4a1afe", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs", "body": "Set release date for 3.1.2.\n\nAcked-by: Eelco Chaudron <echaudro@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Maximets <i.maximets@ovn.org>", "created_at": "2023-06-27T14:30:44Z", "project": "Ovs", "repo": "openvswitch/ovs", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess v17.0.0", "tag_name": "v17.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v17.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "# Release of Vitess v17.0.0\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n### Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- **[Major Changes](#major-changes)**\r\n  - **[Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [Default Local Cell Preference for TabletPicker](#tablet-picker-cell-preference)\r\n    - [Dedicated stats for VTGate Prepare operations](#dedicated-vtgate-prepare-stats)\r\n    - [VTAdmin web migrated from create-react-app to vite](#migrated-vtadmin)\r\n    - [Keyspace name validation in TopoServer](#keyspace-name-validation)\r\n    - [Shard name validation in TopoServer](#shard-name-validation)\r\n    - [Compression CLI flags removed from vtctld and vtctldclient binaries](#remove-compression-flags-from-vtctld-binaries)\r\n    - [VtctldClient command RestoreFromBackup will now use the correct context](#vtctldclient-command-restorefrombackup-will-now-use-the-correct-context)\r\n    - [VTTablet Restore Metrics](#vttablet-restore-metrics)\r\n  - **[New command line flags and behavior](#new-flag)**\r\n    - [Builtin backup: read buffering flags](#builtin-backup-read-buffering-flags)\r\n    - [Manifest backup external decompressor command](#manifest-backup-external-decompressor-command)\r\n    - [Throttler config via topo enabled by default](#throttler-config-via-topo)\r\n  - **[New stats](#new-stats)**\r\n    - [Detailed backup and restore stats](#detailed-backup-and-restore-stats)\r\n    - [VTtablet Error count with code](#vttablet-error-count-with-code)\r\n    - [VReplication stream status for Prometheus](#vreplication-stream-status-for-prometheus)\r\n  - **[Online DDL](#online-ddl)**\r\n    - [--cut-over-threshold DDL strategy flag](#online-ddl-cut-over-threshold-flag)\r\n  - **[VReplication](#vreplication)**\r\n    - [Support for MySQL 8.0 `binlog_transaction_compression`](#binlog-compression)\r\n    - [Support for the `noblob` binlog row image mode](#noblob)\r\n  - **[VTTablet](#vttablet)**\r\n    - [VTTablet: Initializing all replicas with super_read_only](#vttablet-initialization)\r\n    - [Vttablet Schema Reload Timeout](#vttablet-schema-reload-timeout)\r\n    - [Settings pool enabled](#settings-pool)\r\n  - **[VTGate](#vtgate)**\r\n    - [StreamExecute GRPC API](#stream-execute)\r\n    - [Insert Planner Gen4](#insert-planner)\r\n  - **[Deprecations and Deletions](#deprecations-and-deletions)**\r\n    - [Deprecated Flags](#deprecated-flags)\r\n    - [Deprecated Stats](#deprecated-stats)\r\n    - [Deprecated `vtgr`](#deprecated-vtgr)\r\n    - [Deprecated `k8stopo`](#deprecated-k8stopo)\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"major-changes\"/>Major Changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"tablet-picker-cell-preference\"/>Default Local Cell Preference for TabletPicker\r\n\r\nWe added options to the `TabletPicker` that allow for specifying a cell preference in addition to making the default behavior to give priority to the local cell *and any alias it belongs to*. We are also introducing a new way to select tablet type preference which should eventually replace the `in_order:` hint currently used as a prefix for tablet types. The signature for creating a new `TabletPicker` now looks like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewTabletPicker(\r\n\tctx context.Context,\r\n\tts *topo.Server,\r\n\tcells []string,\r\n\tlocalCell, keyspace, shard, tabletTypesStr string,\r\n\toptions TabletPickerOptions,\r\n) (*TabletPicker, error) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere ctx, localCell, option are all new parameters.\r\n\r\n`option` is of type `TabletPickerOptions` and includes two fields, `CellPreference` and `TabletOrder`.\r\n- `CellPreference`: \"PreferLocalWithAlias\" (default) gives preference to vtgate's local cell, or \"OnlySpecified\" which only picks from the cells explicitly passed in by the client\r\n- `TabletOrder`: \"Any\" (default) for no ordering or random, or \"InOrder\" to use the order specified by the client\r\n\r\nSee [PR 12282 Description](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12282) for examples on how this changes cell picking behavior.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgr-default-tls-version\"/>Default TLS version changed for `vtgr`\r\n\r\nWhen using TLS with `vtgr`, we now default to TLS 1.2 if no other explicit version is configured. Configuration flags are provided to explicitly configure the minimum TLS version to be used.\r\n\r\n`vtgr` is now deprecated as part of `v17.0.0`, please see [the deprecation notice](#deprecated-vtgr).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"dedicated-vtgate-prepare-stats\">Dedicated stats for VTGate Prepare operations\r\n\r\nPrior to v17 Vitess incorrectly combined stats for VTGate `Execute` and `Prepare` operations under a single stats key (`Execute`). In v17 `Execute` and `Prepare` operations generate stats under independent stats keys.\r\n\r\nHere is a (condensed) example of stats output:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"VtgateApi\": {\r\n    \"Histograms\": {\r\n      \"Execute.src.primary\": {\r\n        \"500000\": 5\r\n      },\r\n      \"Prepare.src.primary\": {\r\n        \"100000000\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"VtgateApiErrorCounts\": {\r\n    \"Execute.src.primary.INVALID_ARGUMENT\": 3,\r\n    \"Execute.src.primary.ALREADY_EXISTS\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"migrated-vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin web migrated to vite\r\n\r\nPreviously, VTAdmin web used the Create React App framework to test, build, and serve the application. In v17, Create React App has been removed, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used in its place. Some of the main changes include:\r\n- Vite uses `VITE_*` environment variables instead of `REACT_APP_*` environment variables\r\n- Vite uses `import.meta.env` in place of `process.env`\r\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is used in place of Jest for testing\r\n- Our protobufjs generator now produces an es6 module instead of commonjs to better work with Vite's defaults\r\n- `public/index.html` has been moved to root directory in web/vtadmin\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"keyspace-name-validation\">Keyspace name validation in TopoServer\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, it was possible to create a keyspace with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations.\r\n\r\nKeyspace names are restricted to using only ASCII characters, digits and `_` and `-`. TopoServer's `GetKeyspace` and `CreateKeyspace` methods return an error if given an invalid name.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"shard-name-validation\">Shard name validation in TopoServer\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, it was possible to create a shard name with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations.\r\n\r\nShard names are restricted to using only ASCII characters, digits and `_` and `-`. TopoServer's `GetShard` and `CreateShard` methods return an error if given an invalid name.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"remove-compression-flags-from-vtctld-binaries\">Compression CLI flags remove from vtctld and vtctldclient binaries\r\n\r\nThe CLI flags below were mistakenly added to `vtctld` and `vtctldclient` in v15. In v17, they are no longer present in those binaries.\r\n\r\n * `--compression-engine-name`\r\n * `--compression-level`\r\n * `--external-compressor`\r\n * `--external-compressor-extension`\r\n * `--external-decompressor`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"VtctldClient-RestoreFromBackup\">VtctldClient command RestoreFromBackup will now use the correct context\r\n\r\nThe VtctldClient command `RestoreFromBackup` initiates an asynchronous process on the specified tablet to restore data from either the latest backup or the closest one before the specified backup-timestamp.\r\nPrior to v17, this asynchronous process could run indefinitely in the background since it was called using the background context. In v17 [PR#12830](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12830),\r\nthis behavior was changed to use a context with a timeout of `action_timeout`. If you are using VtctldClient to initiate a restore, make sure you provide an appropriate value for action_timeout to give enough\r\ntime for the restore process to complete. Otherwise, the restore will throw an error if the context expires before it completes.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-restore-metrics\">VTTablet Restore Metrics\r\n\r\nAs part of the VTTablet Sidecar Schema Maintenance Refactor in v16.0.0, we dropped the `local_metadata` table from the sidecar database schema. This table was storing a couple of metrics related to restores from backup.\r\nThey have now been re-introduced as metrics that can be accessed from `/debug/vars`.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"Vttablet-TxThrottler\">Vttablet's transaction throttler now also throttles DML outside of `BEGIN; ...; COMMIT;` blocks\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, `vttablet`'s transaction throttler (enabled with `--enable-tx-throttler`) would only throttle requests done inside an explicit transaction, i.e., a `BEGIN; ...; COMMIT;` block.\r\nIn v17 [PR#13040](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13037), this behavior was being changed so that it also throttles work outside of explicit transactions for `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/LOAD` queries.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-flag\"/>New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"builtin-backup-read-buffering-flags\"/>Backup --builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size and --builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size\r\n\r\nPrior to v17 the builtin Backup Engine does not use read buffering for restores, and for backups uses a hardcoded write buffer size of `2097152 bytes`.\r\n\r\nIn v17 these defaults may be tuned with, respectively `--builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size` and `--builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size`.\r\n\r\n- `--builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size`:  read files using an IO buffer of this many bytes. Golang defaults are used when set to `0`.\r\n- `--builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size`: write files using an IO buffer of this many bytes. Golang defaults are used when set to `0`. (default `2097152`)\r\n\r\nThese flags are applicable to the following programs:\r\n\r\n- `vtbackup`\r\n- `vtctld`\r\n- `vttablet`\r\n- `vttestserver`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"manifest-backup-external-decompressor-command\" />Manifest backup external decompressor command\r\n\r\nAdd a new builtin/xtrabackup flag `--manifest-external-decompressor`. When set the value of that flag is stored in the manifest field `ExternalDecompressor`. This manifest field may be consulted when decompressing a backup that was compressed with an external command.\r\n\r\nThis feature enables the following flow:\r\n\r\n 1. Take a backup using an external compressor\r\n    ```\r\n     Backup --compression-engine=external \\\r\n            --external-compressor=zstd \\\r\n            --manifest-external-decompressor=\"zstd -d\"\r\n    ```\r\n 2. Restore that backup with a mere `Restore` command, without having to specify `--external-decompressor`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"throttler-config-via-topo\" />vttablet --throttler-config-via-topo\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in v16 and defaulted to `false`. In v17 it defaults to `true`, and there is no need to supply it.\r\n\r\nNote that this flag overrides `--enable-lag-throttler` and `--throttle-threshold`, which now give warnings, and will be removed in v18.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New stats\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"detailed-backup-and-restore-stats\"/>Detailed backup and restore stats\r\n\r\n##### Backup metrics\r\n\r\nMetrics related to backup operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet.\r\n\r\n- `BackupBytes`\r\n- `BackupCount`\r\n- `BackupDurationNanosecond`\r\n\r\nDepending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a backup may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Reading files from disk.\r\n* Compressing files.\r\n* Uploading compress files to cloud object storage.\r\n\r\nThese operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.\r\n\r\n##### Restore metrics\r\n\r\nMetrics related to restore operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet:\r\n\r\n- `RestoreBytes`\r\n- `RestoreCount`\r\n- `RestoreDurationNanoseconds`\r\n\r\nDepending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a restore may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Downloading compressed files from cloud object storage.\r\n* Decompressing files.\r\n* Writing decompressed files to disk.\r\n\r\nThese operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.\r\n\r\n##### Vtbackup metrics\r\n\r\nVtbackup exports some metrics which are not available elsewhere:\r\n\r\n- `DurationByPhaseSeconds`\r\n\r\nVtbackup fetches the last backup, restores it to an empty mysql installation, replicates recent changes into that installation, and then takes a backup of that installation.\r\n\r\n`DurationByPhaseSeconds` exports timings for these individual phases.\r\n\r\n##### Example\r\n\r\n**A snippet of vtbackup metrics after running it against the local example after creating the initial cluster**\r\n\r\n(Processed with `jq` for readability.)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n

implementation during the backup phase.\r\n* `DurationByPhaseSeconds[\"CatchUpReplication\"]` measures how long it took to catch-up replication after the restore phase.\r\n* `DurationByPhaseSeconds[\"RestoreLastBackup\"]` measures to the duration of the restore phase.\r\n* `RestoreDurationNanoseconds[\"-.-.Restore\"]` also measures to the duration of the restore phase.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-error-count-with-code\"/>VTTablet error count with error code\r\n\r\n##### VTTablet Error Count\r\n\r\nWe are introducing new error counter `QueryErrorCountsWithCode` for VTTablet. It is similar to existing [QueryErrorCounts](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vttablet/tabletserver/query_engine.go#L174) except it contains errorCode as additional dimension.\r\nWe will deprecate `QueryErrorCounts` in v18.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vreplication-stream-status-for-prometheus\"/>VReplication stream status for Prometheus\r\n\r\nVReplication publishes the `VReplicationStreamState` status which reports the state of VReplication streams. For example, here's what it looks like in the local cluster example after the MoveTables step:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"VReplicationStreamState\": {\r\n  \"commerce2customer.1\": \"Running\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, this data was not available via the Prometheus backend. In v17, workflow states are also published as a Prometheus gauge with a `state` label and a value of `1.0`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# HELP vttablet_v_replication_stream_state State of vreplication workflow\r\n# TYPE vttablet_v_replication_stream_state gauge\r\nvttablet_v_replication_stream_state{counts=\"1\",state=\"Running\",workflow=\"commerce2customer\"} 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet\"/>VTTablet\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-initialization\"/>Initializing all replicas with super_read_only\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent SUPER privileged users like `root` or `vt_dba` from producing errant GTIDs on replicas, all the replica MySQL servers are initialized with the MySQL\r\nglobal variable `super_read_only` value set to `ON`. During failovers, we set `super_read_only` to `OFF` for the promoted primary tablet. This will allow the\r\nprimary to accept writes. All of the shard's tablets, except the current primary, will still have their global variable `super_read_only` set to `ON`. This will make sure that apart from\r\nMySQL replication no other component, offline system or operator can write directly to a replica.\r\n\r\nReference PR for this change is [PR #12206](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12206)\r\n\r\nAn important note regarding this change is how the default `init_db.sql` file has changed.\r\nThis is even more important if you are running Vitess on the vitess-operator.\r\nYou must ensure your `init_db.sql` is up-to-date with the new default for `v17.0.0`.\r\nThe default file can be found in `./config/init_db.sql`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-schema-reload-timeout\"/>Vttablet Schema Reload Timeout\r\n\r\nA new flag, `--schema-change-reload-timeout` has been added to timeout the reload of the schema that Vttablet does periodically. This is required because sometimes this operation can get stuck after MySQL restarts, etc. More details available in the issue https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13001.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"settings-pool\"/>Settings Pool\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in v15 and it enables pooling the connection with modified connection settings.\r\nTo know more what it does read the [v15 release notes](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v15.0.0) or the [blog](https://vitess.io/blog/2023-03-27-connection-pooling-in-vitess/) or [docs](https://vitess.io/docs/17.0/reference/query-serving/reserved-conn/)\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"online-ddl\"/>Online DDL\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"online-ddl-cut-over-threshold-flag\" />--cut-over-threshold DDL strategy flag\r\n\r\nOnline DDL's strategy now accepts `--cut-over-threshold` (type: `duration`) flag.\r\n\r\nThis flag stand for the timeout in a `vitess` migration's cut-over phase, which includes the final locking of tables before finalizing the migration.\r\n\r\nThe value of the cut-over threshold should be high enough to support the async nature of vreplication catchup phase, as well as accommodate some replication lag. But it mustn't be too high. While cutting over, the migrated table is being locked, causing app connection and query pileup, consuming query buffers, and holding internal mutexes.\r\n\r\nRecommended range for this variable is `5s` - `30s`. Default: `10s`.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"noblob\"/>Support for the `noblob` binlog row image mode \r\n\r\nThe `noblob` binlog row image is now supported by the MoveTables and Reshard VReplication workflows. If the source \r\nor target database has this mode, other workflows like OnlineDDL, Materialize and CreateLookupVindex will error out.\r\nThe row events streamed by the VStream API, where blobs and text columns have not changed, will contain null values \r\nfor those columns, indicated by a `length:-1`.\r\n\r\nReference PR for this change is [PR #12905](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12905)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"binlog-compression\"/>Support for MySQL 8.0 binary log transaction compression\r\n\r\nMySQL 8.0 added support for [binary log compression via transaction (GTID) compression in 8.0.20](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysql-8-0-20-replication-enhancements/).\r\nYou can read more about this feature here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log-transaction-compression.html\r\n\r\nThis can \u2014 at the cost of increased CPU usage \u2014 dramatically reduce the amount of data sent over the wire for MySQL replication while also dramatically reducing the overall\r\nstorage space needed to retain binary logs (for replication, backup and recovery, CDC, etc). For larger installations this was a very desirable feature and while you could\r\ntechnically use it with Vitess (the MySQL replica-sets making up each shard could use it fine) there was one very big limitation \u2014 [VReplication workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vreplication/)\r\nwould not work. Given the criticality of VReplication workflows within Vitess, this meant that in practice this MySQL feature was not usable within Vitess clusters.\r\n\r\nWe have addressed this issue in [PR #12950](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12950) by adding support for processing the compressed transaction events in VReplication,\r\nwithout any (known) limitations.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtgate\"/>VTGate\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"stream-execute\"/>Modified StreamExecute GRPC API\r\n\r\nEarlier VTGate grpc api for `StreamExecute` did not return the session in the response.\r\nEven though the underlying implementation supported transactions and other features that requires session persistence.\r\nWith [PR #13131](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13131) VTGate will return the session to the client\r\nso that it can be persisted with the client and sent back to VTGate on the next api call.\r\n\r\nThis does not impact anyone using the mysql client library to connect to VTGate.\r\nThis could be a breaking change for grpc api users based on how they have implemented their grpc clients.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"insert-planner\"/> Insert Planning with Gen4\r\n\r\nGen4 planner was made default in v14 for `SELECT` queries. In v15 `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries were moved to Gen4 framework.\r\nWith this release `INSERT` queries are moved to Gen4.\r\n\r\nClients can move to old v3 planner for inserts by using `V3Insert` planner version with `--planner-version` vtgate flag or with comment directive /*vt+ planner=<planner_version>` for individual query.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecations-and-deletions\"/>Deprecations and Deletions\r\n\r\n- The deprecated `automation` and `automationservice` protobuf definitions and associated client and server packages have been removed.\r\n- Auto-population of DDL revert actions and tables at execution-time has been removed. This is now handled entirely at enqueue-time.\r\n- Backwards-compatibility for failed migrations without a `completed_timestamp` has been removed (see https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/8499).\r\n- The deprecated `Key`, `Name`, `Up`, and `TabletExternallyReparentedTimestamp` fields were removed from the JSON representation of `TabletHealth` structures.\r\n- The `MYSQL_FLAVOR` environment variable is no longer used.\r\n- The `--enable-query-plan-field-caching`/`--enable_query_plan_field_caching` vttablet flag was deprecated in v15 and has now been removed.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-flags\"/>Deprecated Command Line Flags\r\n\r\n- Flag `vtctld_addr` has been deprecated and will be deleted in a future release. This affects `vtgate`, `vttablet` and `vtcombo`.\r\n- The flag `schema_change_check_interval` used to accept either a Go duration value (e.g. `1m` or `30s`) or a bare integer, which was treated as seconds.\r\n  This behavior was deprecated in v15.0.0 and has been removed.\r\n  `schema_change_check_interval` now **only** accepts Go duration values. This affects `vtctld`.\r\n- The flag `durability_policy` is no longer used by vtctld. Instead it reads the durability policies for all keyspaces from the topology server.\r\n- The flag `use_super_read_only` is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. This affects `vttablet`.\r\n- The flag `queryserver-config-schema-change-signal-interval` is deprecated and will be removed in a later release.

If necessary, a specific version of the SDK can be downloaded for cases when the project has yet to upgrade to a later or latest version. ([#6443](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6443))\n- Currently, the operator SDK for the Ansible operator lacks options to customize the leader election resource lock behavior. This limits the flexibility of the operator and prevents users from adjusting lease duration and renew deadline according to their specific needs.\nChanges: Implemented enhancements to the operator SDK to include additional flags for configuring leader election resource lock options. These changes provide users with the ability to specify the type of resource object used for locking during leader election and customize the lease duration and renew deadline.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-lease-duration flag to allow users to define the duration that non-leader candidates will wait to force acquire leadership. The default duration is set to 15 seconds.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-renew-deadline flag, enabling users to set the renew deadline, which determines the duration that the acting control plane will retry refreshing leadership before giving up. The default duration is set to 10 seconds.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-resource-lock flag to allow users to define the type of resource object that is used for locking during leader election. Supported options are 'leases', 'endpointsleases', and 'configmapsleases'. The default option is 'leases'.\nThese changes provide more flexibility and control over leader election behavior, allowing operators to adapt to various deployment scenarios and specific requirements. ([#6426](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6426))\n\n### Changes\n\n- Currently, when setting `overrideValues` in your `watches.yaml`, every entry is logged with its key and its value. When working with confidential information such as credentials, logging those information would not be optimal nor desirable. Therefore, there should be a way to silence/suppress these values.\nThis feature introduces the `--suppress-override-values` boolean-flag for the `helm-operator`. When set to true, the value of the overrideValues entry is sanitized with this value \"****\".\nThis is a simple example of `overrideValues` of the `watches.yaml` ```yaml overrideValues:\n  x: y\n```\nThe default-value of `--suppress-override-values` is `false` so therefore we would get this warning logged: `Chart value x overridden to y by operator's watches.yaml`\nWhen setting `--suppress-override-values` `true` the warning will be logged in the following manner: `Chart value x overridden to **** by operator's watches.yaml`. ([#6469](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6469))\n- (images): Bumps all Operator SDK maintained images to now use ubi(-minimal) tag 8.8. ([#6466](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6466))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- In `run bundle-upgrade`, hash the cache directory name to avoid error of too long file name.

Given that components is currently an alpha feature, we felt that now was the time to adjust if ever.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on on https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/4402, which will make the ordering of `resources`, `components`, and other generators customizable in the kustomization file. Please use that issue for tracking if you are blocked from upgrading kustomize for this reason, and we hope to have it available soon.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5141 for more detailed discussion. \r\n\r\n### Bug fixes: \r\n\r\n#5030: `kustomize edit` will return an error if there is no matching path\r\n#5170: components are now applied after generators\r\n#4949: error if kustomization file is empty\r\n\r\n### Dependency updates\r\n\r\n#5186: Update gnostic dependency with gnostic-models\r\n#5187: Bump to go 1.20\r\n#5212: pin to kyaml v0.14.3\r\n#5213: pin to cmd/config v0.11.3\r\n#5214: pin to api 0.14.0\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2023-06-19T16:56:13Z", "project": "Kustomize", "repo": "kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "type": "Config", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.10.3", "tag_name": "v2.10.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.10.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containous/traefik", "body": "**Bug fixes:**\r\n- **[acme]** Update go-acme/lego to v4.12.2 ([#9935](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/9971) by [ldez](https://github.com/ldez))\r\n", "created_at": "2023-06-19T16:14:30Z", "project": "Traefik", "repo": "containous/traefik", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.14.0", "tag_name": "v1.14.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/releases/tag/v1.14.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault", "body": "## 1.14.0\r\n### June 21, 2023\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES:\r\n\r\n* secrets/pki: Maintaining running count of certificates will be turned off by default.\r\nTo re-enable keeping these metrics available on the tidy status endpoint, enable\r\nmaintain_stored_certificate_counts on tidy-config, to also publish them to the\r\nmetrics consumer, enable publish_stored_certificate_count_metrics .

Recordings are signed and stored in a\r\n  Storage Bucket. Recordings can be played back in the admin UI.\r\n  * Storage Buckets: This release introduces Storage Buckets, a Boundary\r\n    resource that represents a bucket in an external object store. Storage\r\n    Buckets can be defined at the global or org scope. When associated with an\r\n    SSH target, the storage bucket is used to store session recordings. This\r\n    release includes support for AWS S3 only.\r\n  * BSR (Boundary Session Recording) file format: BSR is a new specification\r\n    that defines a hierarchical directory structure of files and a binary file\r\n    format. The contents of a BSR include all data transmitted between a user\r\n    and a target during a single session, relevant session metadata and summary\r\n    information. The BSR also includes checksum and signature files for\r\n    cryptographically verifying BSR contents, and a set of KMS wrapped keys for\r\n    use in BSR verification. The BSR format is intended to be extensible to\r\n    support various protocols. With this release BSR supports the SSH protocol.\r\n    It also supports converting an SSH channel recording into an\r\n    [asciicast](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md)\r\n    format that is playable by asciinema.\r\n  * To learn more about this new feature, refer to the\r\n    [documentation](http://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording).\r\n* KMS workers: KMS workers now have feature parity with PKI workers (they\r\n  support multi-hop and Vault private access) and support separate KMSes for\r\n  authenticating downstreams across different networks. See the [worker\r\n  configuration documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/worker)\r\n  for more information. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3101))\r\n* roles: Perform additional validity checking on grants at submission time ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3081))\r\n* targets: The new `default_client_port` field allows specifying the default\r\n  port to use on the client side when connecting to a target, unless overridden\r\n  by the client via `-listen-port` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2767))\r\n* cli/api/sdk: New LDAP auth method type added with support for create, read,\r\n  update, delete, and list (see new cli `ldap` subcommands available on CRUDL\r\n  operations for examples), as well as the ability to authenticate against it\r\n  via the SDK, CLI, admin UI, and desktop client. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2912))\r\n* ui: Display external names when listing dynamic hosts ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1664))\r\n* ui: Add support for LDAP authentication ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1645))\r\n* Dynamic Host Catalog: You can now view the AWS or Azure host name when listing hosts in CLI, admin console, and desktop client. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3074))\r\n* Add configuration for license reporting (Enterprise only)\r\n\r\n### Deprecations/Changes\r\n\r\n* With the introduction of the new KMS variant for worker registration (as\r\n  described below), using the deprecated behavior requires opting-in. This is\r\n  only recommended if compatibility with pre-0.13 workers using the KMS auth\r\n  method is required. Requiring opting in removes some potentially confusing\r\n  behavior for deciding when to use the old versus new mechanism. To opt in, add\r\n  `use_deprecated_kms_auth_method = true` to the `worker` config block. Note\r\n  that if a 0.13+ worker using KMS connects to a 0.13+ controller using KMS, the\r\n  transition to the new method will happen automatically. To go back to the old\r\n  method after that will require the worker to be deleted and re-added with the\r\n  `use_deprecated_kms_auth_method` config field specified.\r\n* When grants are added to roles additional validity checking is now performed.\r\n  This extra validity checking is designed to reject grants that are not\r\n  [documented grant formats](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions/permission-grant-formats)\r\n  or are for combinations of IDs and types that cannot actually be used\r\n  together. These previously would have been accepted without error but would\r\n  never result in permissions being granted, causing confusion. As a result,\r\n  attempting to write such grants into roles may now result in an error; the\r\n  error message gives hints for resolution.\r\n* `WithAutomaticVersioning` for auth tokens in Go SDK: this option was\r\n  incorrectly being generated for auth token resources, which do not support\r\n  versioning. This is technically a breaking change, but it was a no-op option\r\n  anyways that there was no reason to be using. It has now been removed.\r\n* Plugins: With the introduction of the storage plugin service, the Azure and AWS Host plugin \r\n  repositories have been renamed to drop the `host` element of the repository name: \r\n\r\n   - https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-host-aws -> https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws\r\n   - https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-host-azure -> https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure\r\n  \r\n  Similarly the `plugins/host` package has been renamed to `plugins/boundary`\r\n  ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3262),[PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/24), [PR3](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure/pull/12), [PR4](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3266)).\r\n* PostgreSQL 12 or greater is now required. PostgreSQL 11 is no longer\r\n  supported.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* targets: `authorize-session` now works properly when using a target's name as\r\n  the identifier and the target name contains one or more slashes ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3249))\r\n* resource listing: API requests to list a resource (targets, sessions, users,\r\n  etc) now properly return all resources the callers has appropriate permission\r\n  to list ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3278))\r\n* sessions: Fix a bug that contributed to slow response times when listing\r\n  sessions that had a large number of connections ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3280))\r\n* ui: Fix `client secret` bug for OIDC authentication methods([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1698))\r\n* ui: Fix linking to a Host from the Host Set screen of a Dynamic Host Catalog ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1659))", "created_at": "2023-06-09T23:42:30Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Istio 1.18.0", "tag_name": "1.18.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.18.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio", "body": "[Artifacts](http://gcsweb.istio.io/gcs/istio-release/releases/1.18.0/)\r\n[Release Notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.18.x/announcing-1.18/)", "created_at": "2023-06-07T18:45:48Z", "project": "Istio", "repo": "istio/istio", "type": "ServiceMesh", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "8.1.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/commits/094227ef1e145913b35ac092084d5eb0ad8e5c72", "repo_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet", "body": "(packaging) Updating manpage file for main", "created_at": "2023-06-06T21:43:12Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.22.1", "tag_name": "v2.22.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/releases/tag/v2.22.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray", "body": "### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Don't let find search filesystem mounts in docker build run step (#10131, @tomodachi)\r\n- Fix Dockerfile for newest directory layout (#10128, @dabeck)\r\n- Fix dockerfile build error (#10181, @yankay)\r\n- Fix metrics-server deployment to run with kubernetes 1.26+ (#10183, @mzaian)\r\n- update README for v2.22.0 (#10180, @Payback159)\r\n- Fix Update MetalLB deployment, wait for resource.

Filters can indicate whether the direct IP should be used or whether a reported IP from `PROXY` or `X-Forwarded-For` should be used instead. If the latter, Contour's `numTrustedHops` setting will be respected when determining the source IP. Filters defined at the VirtualHost level apply to all routes, unless overridden by a route-specific filter.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n- [HTTPProxy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.HTTPProxy)\r\n- [IPFilterPolicy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.IPFilterPolicy)\r\n- [Envoy RBAC filter documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/rbac/v3/rbac.proto)\r\n\r\n(#5008, @ecordell)\r\n\r\n## Add Tracing Support\r\n\r\nContour now supports exporting tracing data to [OpenTelemetry][1]\r\n\r\nThe Contour configuration file and ContourConfiguration CRD will be extended with a new optional `tracing` section. This configuration block, if present, will enable tracing and will define the trace properties needed to generate and export trace data.\r\n\r\n### Contour supports the following configurations\r\n- Custom service name, the default is `contour`.\r\n- Custom sampling rate, the default is `100`.\r\n- Custom the maximum length of the request path, the default is `256`.\r\n- Customize span tags from literal and request headers.\r\n- Customize whether to include the pod's hostname and namespace.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://opentelemetry.io/\r\n\r\n(#5043, @yangyy93)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## Add support for Global External Authorization for HTTPProxy.\r\n\r\nContour now supports external authorization for all hosts by setting the config as part of the `contourConfig` like so: \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nglobalExtAuth:\r\n  extensionService: projectcontour-auth/htpasswd\r\n  failOpen: false\r\n  authPolicy:\r\n    context:\r\n      header1: value1\r\n      header2: value2\r\n  responseTimeout: 1s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndividual hosts can also override or opt out of this global configuration. \r\nYou can read more about this feature in detail in the [guide](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.25/guides/external-authorization/#global-external-authorization).\r\n\r\n(#4994, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: Add support for exact path match condition\r\n\r\nHttpProxy conditions block now also supports exact path match condition.\r\n\r\n(#5000, @arjunsalyan)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: Internal Redirect support\r\n\r\nContour now supports specifying an `internalRedirectPolicy` on a `Route` to handle 3xx redirects internally, that is capturing a configurable 3xx redirect response, synthesizing a new request, sending it to the upstream specified by the new route match, and returning the redirected response as the response to the original request.\r\n\r\n(#5010, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: implement HTTP query parameter matching\r\n\r\nContour now implements HTTP query parameter matching for HTTPProxy resource-based routes. It supports `Exact`, `Prefix`, `Suffix`, `Regex` and `Contains` string matching conditions together with the `IgnoreCase` modifier and also the `Present` matching condition. For example, the following HTTPProxy will route requests based on the configured condition examples for the given query parameter `search`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: httpproxy-queryparam-matching\r\nspec:\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=example' as is\r\n          name: search\r\n          exact: example\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s1\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=prefixthis' or any string value prefixed by `prefix` (case insensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          prefix: PreFix\r\n          ignoreCase: true\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s2\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=thispostfix' or any string value suffixed by `postfix` (case sensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          suffix: postfix\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s3\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=regularexp123' or any string value matching the given regular expression\r\n          name: search\r\n          regex: ^regular.*\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s4\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=somethinginsideanother' or any string value containing the substring 'inside' (case sensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          contains: inside\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s5\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=' or any string value given to the named parameter\r\n          name: search\r\n          present: true\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s6\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5036, @relu)\r\n\r\n## Allow Disabling Features\r\n\r\nThe `contour serve` command takes a new optional flag, `--disable-feature`, that allows disabling certain features.\r\n\r\nThe flag is used to disable the informer for a custom resource, effectively making the corresponding CRD optional in the cluster. You can provide the flag multiple times.\r\n\r\nCurrent options include `extensionservices` and the experimental Gateway API features `tlsroutes` and `grpcroutes`.\r\n\r\nFor example, to disable ExtensionService CRD, use the flag as follows: `--disable-feature=extensionservices`.\r\n\r\n(#5080, @nsimons)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: support GRPCRoute\r\n\r\nContour now implements GRPCRoute (https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/grpcroute/). The \"core conformance\" parts of the spec are implemented. See https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.25/guides/grpc/#gateway-api-configuration on how to use GRPCRoute.\r\n\r\n(#5114, @fangfpeng)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Add `AllowPrivateNetwork` to `CORSPolicy` for support Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network. (#5034, @lvyanru8200)\r\n- Optimize processing of HTTPProxy, Secret and other objects by avoiding full object comparison. This reduces CPU usage during object updates. (#5064, @tsaarni)\r\n- Gateway API: support the `path` field on the HTTPRoute RequestRedirect filter. (#5068, @skriss)\r\n- Optimized the memory usage when handling Secrets in Kubernetes client informer cache. (#5099, @tsaarni)\r\n- Adds a new gauge metric, `contour_dag_cache_object`, to indicate the total number of items that are currently in the DAG cache. (#5109, @izturn)\r\n- Gateway API: for routes, replace use of custom `NotImplemented` condition with the upstream `Accepted: false` condition with reason `UnsupportedValue` to match the spec. (#5125, @skriss)\r\n- `%REQ()` operator in request/response header policies now properly supports HTTP/2 pseudo-headers, header fallbacks, and truncating header values. (#5130, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: for routes, always set ResolvedRefs condition, even if true to match the spec. (#5131, @izturn)\r\n- Set 502 response if include references another root. (#5157, @liangyuanpeng)\r\n- Update to support Gateway API v0.6.2, which includes updated conformance tests. See release notes [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.6.2). (#5194, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- HTTPProxy: support Host header rewrites per-service. (#5195, @fangfpeng)\r\n- Contour now sets `GOMAXPROCS` to match the number of CPUs available to the container which results in lower and more stable CPU usage under high loads and where the container and node CPU counts differ significantly.\r\nThis is the default behavior but can be overridden by specifying `GOMAXPROCS` to a fixed value as an environment variable. (#5211, @rajatvig)\r\n- Gateway API: Contour now always sets the Accepted condition on Gateway Listeners. If there is a specific validation error of top-level fields (port, protocol, etc.) the status is set to False, otherwise it is set to True. (#5220, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: Envoy containers manifests should use value from `envoy.health.port` and `envoy.metrics.port` if they are defined in `ContourDeployment.spec.runtimeSettings`. (#5233, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n- Gateway API: support regex path/header match for HTTPRoute and regex header match for GRPCRoute. (#5239, @fangfpeng)\r\n- Fix HTTPProxy duplicate include detection. If we have multiple distinct includes on the same path but different headers or query parameters, duplicates of any include conditions after the first were not detected. (#5296, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: support regular expressions in HTTPRoute query param match type. (#5310, @padlar)\r\n- Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.25, 1.26, 1.27. (#5318, @skriss)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.26.1. See the [v1.26.0 and v1.26.1 changelogs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.26.1/version_history/v1.26/v1.26) for details. (#5320, @skriss)\r\n- Updates to Go 1.20.4. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20) for more information. (#5347, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Upgrade algolia docsearch to v3 on the docs website (#5129, @pnbrown)\r\n- Updates Steve Kriss as Tech Lead and moves Nick Young to Emeritus Maintainer (#5151, @pnbrown)\r\n- Move to a single set of docs per minor release, e.g. 1.24, 1.23 and 1.22.
