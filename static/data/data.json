Pools with invalid device classes may start failing until the correct device class is specified. For more details, see [#14057](https://github.com/rook/rook/pull/14057).\r\n- Rook has deprecated CSI network \"holder\" pods. If there are pods named `csi-*plugin-holder-*` in the Rook operator namespace, see the [detailed documentation](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.15/CRDs/Cluster/network-providers/#holder-pod-deprecation) to disable them. This deprecation process will be required before upgrading to the future Rook v1.16.\r\n- Ceph COSI driver images have been updated. This impacts existing COSI Buckets, BucketClaims, and BucketAccesses. Update existing clusters following the guide [here](https://github.com/rook/rook/discussions/14297).\r\n- CephObjectStore, CephObjectStoreUser, and OBC endpoint behavior has changed when CephObjectStore `spec.hosting` configurations are set. Use the new `spec.hosting.advertiseEndpoint` config to define required behavior as [documented](../Storage-Configuration/Object-Storage-RGW/object-storage.md#object-store-endpoint).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Added support for Ceph Squid (v19), in addition to Reef (v18) and Quincy (v17). Quincy support will be removed in Rook v1.16.\r\n- Ceph-CSI driver v3.12, including new options for RBD, log rotation, and updated sidecar images.\r\n- Allow updating the device class of OSDs, if `allowDeviceClassUpdate: true` is set in the CephCluster CR.\r\n- Allow updating the weight of an OSD, if `allowOsdCrushWeightUpdate: true` is set in the CephCluster CR.\r\n- Use fully-qualified image names (`docker.io/rook/ceph`) in operator manifests and helm charts.\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- CephObjectStore support for keystone authentication for S3 and Swift. See the [Object store documentation](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.15/Storage-Configuration/Object-Storage-RGW/ceph-object-swift/) to configure.\r\n- CSI operator: CSI settings are moving to CRs managed by a new operator. Once enabled, Rook will convert the settings previously defined in the operator configmap or env vars into the new CRs managed by the CSI operator. There are two steps to enable:\r\n   - Create [csi-operator.yaml](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/release-1.15/deploy/examples/csi-operator.yaml)\r\n   - Set [ROOK_USE_CSI_OPERATOR: true](https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/release-1.15/deploy/examples/operator.yaml#L32) in `operator.yaml`. \r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-20T23:23:42Z", "project": "Rook", "repo": "rook/rook", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v19.0.6", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/chef/commits/8049cf84a40c584fc693d3ac1469722c5f7fd022", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chef/chef", "body": "Bump version to 19.0.6 by Chef Expeditor\n\nObvious fix; these changes are the result of automation not creative thinking.", "created_at": "2024-08-20T20:21:40Z", "project": "Chef", "repo": "chef/chef", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "v1.9.5", "tag_name": "v1.9.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.9.5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform", "body": "## 1.9.5 (August 20, 2024)\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* cloud: The cloud block can now interact with workspaces that have HCP resource IDs.

Highlights include new V2 Data Engine features, platform-agnostic deployment, high availability, and improvements to data protection, stability, performance, and resilience.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorn team appreciates your contributions and anticipates receiving feedback regarding this release.\r\n\r\nFor more information about release-related terminology, see [Releases](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).\r\n\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> The Longhorn team has identified [a critical issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9267) that affects volume attachment in Longhorn v1.7.0. We are currently working on releasing v1.7.1, which will be available soon. If your Longhorn cluster contains `engine` resources with names in the format `<volume name>-e-<8-char random id>` that are created before v1.5.2 and v1.4.4, please put v1.7.0 upgrade on hold until v1.7.1 is available.\r\n>\r\n> You can use the following command to check if it is safe to upgrade your Longhorn cluster to v1.7.0:\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> [ $(kubectl -n longhorn-system get engines.longhorn.io -o name | grep -E '\\-e\\-[a-z0-9]{8}$' | wc -l) -gt 0 ] && echo \"Please hold off on upgrading to v1.7.0 until v1.7.1 is available.\" || echo \"Safe to upgrade to v1.7.0.\"\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the [environment check script](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v1.7.x/scripts/environment_check.sh) overlaps with that of the Longhorn CLI, which is available starting with v1.7.0. Because of this, the script is deprecated in v1.7.0 and is scheduled for removal in v1.8.0.\r\n\r\nFor information about important changes, including feature incompatibility, deprecation, and removal, see [Important Notes](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/important-notes/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Primary Highlights\r\n\r\n### New V2 Data Engine Features\r\n\r\nAlthough the V2 Data Engine is still considered a preview feature in this release, the core functions have been significantly enhanced.\r\n\r\n- [Online replica rebuilding](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7199): Allows Longhorn to rebuild replicas while the volume is running without any IO interruptions.\r\n- [Filesystem trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7534): Reclaims unused space more effectively.\r\n- [Block-type disk support for SPDK AIO, NVMe and VirtIO Bdev drivers](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7672): Broadens the range of compatible hardware and improves performance in high-demand environments.\r\n- [V2 volume support for data plane live upgrade](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6001): Enables upgrading of the spdk_tgt process, which handles IO operations, without any downtime. Coverage of the live upgrade function will be extended to the control plane in a future release.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorn team will continue to develop features for the V1 Data Engine and to prepare the V2 Data Engine for use in all types of environments.\r\n\r\n### Platform-Agnostic Deployment\r\n\r\nLonghorn is designed to seamlessly operate on general-purpose Linux distributions and certain container-optimized operating systems. v1.7.0 provides robust and efficient persistent storage solutions for Kubernetes clusters running on [Container-Optimized OS (COS)](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6165).\r\n\r\n### High Availability\r\n\r\nv1.7.0 introduces features that enhance system resilience and address potential single points of failure. \r\n\r\n- [High availability for backing images](github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2856): Mitigates risks associated with image failures. \r\n- [RWX volumes fast failover](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6205): Enables rapid detection of and response to Share Manager pod failures (independent of the timing and sequence of Kubernetes node failures).\r\n\r\n### Data Protection\r\n\r\nStarting with v1.7.0, Longhorn supports [periodic and on-demand full backups](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7070) that help reduce the likelihood of backup corruption and enhance the overall reliability of the backup process.\r\n\r\n### Scheduling\r\n\r\nThe [replica auto-balancing](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4105) feature was enhanced to address disk space pressure from growing volumes. These enhancements reduce manual intervention by automatically rebalancing replicas under disk pressure and improve performance with faster replica rebuilding through local file copying.\r\n\r\n### Storage Network\r\n\r\nThe storage network now [supports RWX volumes]((https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8184)) with network segregation, enabling dedicated traffic lanes for storage operations.\r\n\r\n### Longhorn CLI\r\n\r\nThe [Longhorn CLI](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7927), which is the official Longhorn command line tool, is introduced in v1.7.0. This tool interacts with Longhorn by creating Kubernetes custom resources (CRs) and executing commands inside a dedicated pod for in-cluster and host operations. Usage scenarios include installation, operations such as exporting replicas, and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before installing Longhorn v1.7.0.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.6.x to v1.7.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.0/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Post-Release Known Issues\r\n\r\nFor information about issues identified after this release, see [Release-Known-Issues](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Release-Known-Issues).\r\n\r\n## Resolved Issues\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n- [FEATURE] Longhorn block-type disks supports different SPDK disk bdev drivers [7672](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7672) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Volume cloning enhancement [2907](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2907) - @yangchiu @PhanLe1010\r\n- [FEATURE] Share manager HA - Experimental [6205](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6205) - @PhanLe1010 @james-munson @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] v2 volume replica online rebuilding [7199](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7199) - @shuo-wu @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] v2 volume supports live upgrade for data plane [6001](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6001) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Use `fsfreeze` instead of `sync` before snapshot [2187](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2187) - @ejweber @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Auto-balancing volumes between nodes & disks [4105](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4105) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n- [FEATURE] HA backing image [2856](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2856) - @ChanYiLin @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Create Longhorn CLI focusing on non CR resource operations [7927](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7927) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Support periodic or on-demand full backups to enhance backup reliability [7070](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7070) - @ChanYiLin @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Improve rebuilding is canceled if it takes longer than 24 hours [2765](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2765) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [UI][FEATURE]  Support volume cloning using UI [8741](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8741) - @a110605 @chriscchien\r\n- [UI][FEATURE] Add backing image encryption and clone support  [8789](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8789) - @a110605 @mantissahz\r\n- [FEATURE] Support volume encryption for (encrypted) backing image volumes [7051](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7051) - @ChanYiLin @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Container-Optimized OS support [6165](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6165) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- [FEATURE] v2 volume supports filesystem trim  [7534](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7534) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Add nodeSelector as a parameter to VolumeSnapshotClass for backing images [6526](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6526) - @ChanYiLin @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Add additional monitoring settings to ServiceMonitor resource.

Therefore, the risk can be controlled by disabling requests from outside of Nacos clusters (e.g. by limiting or not exposing the port) in older versions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this version has further optimized the Derby Ops API by restricting the range of executable SQL commands on the Derby database by default, thereby reducing the risk to users when accessing the Derby Ops API.\r\n\r\nPlease see the details of the changes below:\r\n\r\n# Change details\r\n\r\n## Feature\r\n\r\n## Enhancement&Refactor\r\n[#11887] Add some tips when `token.secret.key` is not base64.\r\n[#12311] Enhance console to support namespace list with selectors.\r\n[#12405] LDAP plugin support custom admin user password for default.\r\n[#12446] Enhance hint when got Mac Instance with error in default auth plugin.\r\n[#12466] Enhance to configurable service metadata and instance metadata length.\r\n[#12477] Enhance default auth plugin to support `auth_basic` when logout.\r\n[#12489] Remove KvStorage and ConsistencyService.\r\n[#12490] Enhance derby mode to support limit SQL Type.\r\n\r\n## BugFix\r\n[#12301] Fix headlth check for persistent instance for different namespace but groupName and serviceName are same.\r\n[#12374] Fix memory calculate error for metrics api.\r\n[#12397] Fix the bug of parsing empty connection control rule problem.\r\n[#12410] Fix no hint when beta config content is not equal with formal content.\r\n\r\n## Dependency\r\n[#12342] Resolve the Hessian package conflict.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @eltociear made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12392\r\n* @Sitosoym made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12324\r\n* @cold-l made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12434\r\n* @KouShenhai made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12386\r\n* @chen10038 made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12310\r\n* @LHyphen made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12442\r\n* @kangzhaok made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12401\r\n* @fuhouyu made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12447\r\n* @gongycn made their first contribution in https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12449\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/compare/2.4.0.1...2.4.1", "created_at": "2024-08-15T09:58:58Z", "project": "Nacos", "repo": "alibaba/nacos", "type": "Discovery", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Istio 1.23.0", "tag_name": "1.23.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.23.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio", "body": "[Artifacts](http://gcsweb.istio.io/gcs/istio-release/releases/1.23.0/)\r\n[Release Notes](https://istio.io/news/releases/1.23.x/announcing-1.23/)", "created_at": "2024-08-15T01:51:57Z", "project": "Istio", "repo": "istio/istio", "type": "ServiceMesh", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "r7.0.14", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo/commits/1b488fa20bdc54915b89f3a6ef981742adbe8cb2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/mongoDb/mongo", "body": "Revert \"SERVER-92273 ListCollections without filter should include commit pending namespaces (7.0 only)\" (#26125)\n\nGitOrigin-RevId: ce59cfc6a3c5e5c067dca0d30697edd68d4f5188", "created_at": "2024-08-14T20:38:09Z", "project": "MongoDb", "repo": "mongoDb/mongo", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Helm v3.15.4", "tag_name": "v3.15.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.15.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/helm/helm", "body": "Helm v3.15.4 is a patch release.

This was changed to align [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/) behaviour with other well-known reverse-proxies behaviour.**\r\n\r\n* SECURITY: upgrade base docker image (Alpine) from 3.20.1 to 3.20.2. See [alpine 3.20.2 release notes](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.20.2-released.html).\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](./vmauth.md): add `keep_original_host` option, which can be used for proxying the original `Host` header from client request to the backend. By default the backend host is used as `Host` header when proxying requests to the configured backends. See [these docs](./vmauth.md#host-http-header).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](./vmauth.md) now returns HTTP 502 status code when all upstream backends are not available. Previously, it returned HTTP 503 status code. This change aligns vmauth behavior with other well-known reverse-proxies behavior.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent dashboard](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/dashboards/vmagent.json): add `Scrape duration 0.99 quantile` panel to show the 99th quantile of scrape duration in seconds. This should help identifying vmagent instances that experiences too high scraping durations.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): Fixes panic if incorrect `metrisql` expression passed to the `prettify-query` API. See this [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6736) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: validate files specified via `-tlsKeyFile` and `-tlsCertFile` cmd-line flags on the process start-up. Previously, validation happened on the first connection accepted by HTTP server. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6608) for the details. Thanks to @yincongcyincong for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6621).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): properly proxy requests to backend urls ending with `/` if the original request path equals to `/`. Previously the trailing `/` at the backend path was incorrectly removed. For example, if the request to `http://vmauth/` is configured to be proxied to `url_prefix=http://backend/foo/`, then it was proxied to `http://backend/foo`, while it should go to `http://backend/foo/`.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): fix `cannot read data after closing the reader` error when proxying HTTP requests without body (aka `GET` requests). The issue has been introduced in [v1.102.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.102.0) in [this commit](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/7ee57974935a662896f2de40fdf613156630617d).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix auto-completion triggers for metric and label names, and disable it after specific characters. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6153) and [these comments](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5866#issuecomment-2065273421).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix automatic addition of quotes when inserting label values from autocomplete suggestions.

Updates logic on finding intersecting route and Listener hostnames to factor in the other Listeners on a Gateway that the route in question may not actually be attached to. Requests should be \"isolated\" to the most specific Listener and it's attached routes.\r\n\r\n(#6162, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Update examples for monitoring Contour and Envoy\r\n\r\nUpdates the [documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/guides/prometheus/) and examples for deploying a monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana) to scrape metrics from Contour and Envoy. Adds a metrics port to the Envoy DaemonSet/Deployment in the example YAMLs to expose port `8002` so that `PodMonitor` resources can be used to find metrics endpoints.\r\n\r\n(#6269, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Update to Gateway API v1.1.0\r\n\r\nGateway API CRD compatibility has been updated to release v1.1.0.\r\n\r\nNotable changes for Contour include:\r\n- The `BackendTLSPolicy` resource has undergone some breaking changes and has been updated to the `v1alpha3` API version. This will require any existing users of this policy to uninstall the v1alpha2 version before installing this newer version.\r\n- `GRPCRoute` has graduated to GA and is now in the `v1` API version.\r\n\r\nFull release notes for this Gateway API release can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.1.0).\r\n\r\n(#6398, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Add Circuit Breaker support for Extension Services\r\n\r\nThis change enables the user to configure the Circuit breakers for extension services either via the global Contour config or on an individual Extension Service.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The `PerHostMaxConnections` is now also configurable via the global settings.\r\n\r\n(#6539, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## Fallback Certificate: Add Global Ext Auth support\r\n\r\nApplies Global Auth filters to Fallback certificate\r\n\r\n(#6558, @erikflores7)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: handle Route conflicts with GRPCRoute.Matches\r\n\r\nIt's possible that multiple GRPCRoutes will define the same Match conditions. In this case the following logic is applied to resolve the conflict:\r\n\r\n- The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with a creation timestamp of \u201c2020-09-08 01:02:03\u201d is given precedence over a Route with a creation timestamp of \u201c2020-09-08 01:02:04\u201d.\r\n- The Route appearing first in alphabetical order (namespace/name) for example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.\r\n\r\nWith above ordering, any GRPCRoute that ranks lower, will be marked with below conditions accordingly:\r\n1. If only partial rules under this GRPCRoute are conflicted, it's marked with `Accepted: True` and `PartiallyInvalid: true` Conditions and Reason: `RuleMatchPartiallyConflict`.\r\n2. If all the rules under this GRPCRoute are conflicted, it's marked with `Accepted: False` Condition and Reason `RuleMatchConflict`.\r\n\r\n(#6566, @lubronzhan)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Fixes bug where external authorization policy was ignored on HTTPProxy direct response routes. (#6426, @shadialtarsha)\r\n- Updates to Kubernetes 1.30. Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30. (#6444, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Enforce `deny-by-default` approach on the `admin` listener by matching on exact paths and on `GET` requests (#6447, @davinci26)\r\n- Add support for defining equal-preference cipher groups ([cipher1|cipher2|...]) and permit `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` to be used separately. (#6461, @tsaarni)\r\n- allow `/stats/prometheus` route on the `admin` listener. (#6503, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n- Improve shutdown manager query to the Envoy stats endpoint for active connections by utilizing a regex filter query param. (#6523, @therealak12)\r\n- Updates to Go 1.22.5. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.minor) for more information. (#6563, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.31.0. See the [Envoy release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.31.0/version_history/v1.31/v1.31.0) for more information about the content of the release. (#6569, @skriss)\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contour sample YAML manifests no longer use `prometheus.io/` annotations\r\n\r\nThe annotations for notifying a Prometheus instance on how to scrape metrics from Contour and Envoy pods have been removed from the deployment YAMLs and the Gateway provisioner. The suggested mechanism for doing so now is to use [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) and the [`PodMonitor`](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/design/#podmonitor) resource.\r\n\r\n(#6269, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## xDS server type fields in config file and ContourConfiguration CRD are deprecated\r\n\r\nThese fields are officially deprecated now that the `contour` xDS server implementation is deprecated. They are planned to be removed in the 1.31 release, along with the `contour` xDS server implementation.\r\n\r\n(#6561, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.30.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.28 through 1.30.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

This is a Community version release that introduces new features, enhancements, and various updates.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n## Rancher General\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now supports Kubernetes v1.29 and v1.30. See  [#43110](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43110) for information on Rancher support for Kubernetes v1.29, and see [#45089](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45089) for information on Rancher support for  Kubernetes v1.30. Additionally, the upstream Kubernetes changelogs for [v1.29](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md) and [v1.30](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md) can be viewed for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes v1.25 and v1.26 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.9.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#45882](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45882).\r\n- The `external-rules` [feature flag](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/feature-flags) functionality is removed in Rancher v2.9.0 as the behavior is enabled by default. The feature flag is [still present](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46272) when upgrading from v2.8.5; however, enabling or disabling the feature won't have any effect. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32196](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-64jq-m7rq-768h) and [#45863](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45863).\r\n- Rancher now validates Container Default Resource Limit on Projects. Validation mimics the upstream behavior of the Kubernetes API server when it validates LimitRanges. The container default resource configuration must have properly formatted quantities for all requests and limits. Limits for any resource must not be less than requests. See [#39700](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39700).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Rancher v2.9.0 does not currently support vSphere CSI charts in RKE2 v1.30.2 instances that run Kubernetes v1.30. A fix in RKE2 is in progress and being tracked by [#6334](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/6334). Once the fix is completed, support for vSphere CSI charts while using RKE2 in Rancher v2.9.0 will be added via a KDM release. See [#46132](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46132).\r\n- After upgrading to v2.9.0, Rancher's pods may crash and fail to become available. This primarily affects clusters which have been upgraded from older Kubernetes versions, and can also result in disconnected downstream clusters. As a workaround, all CRDs in each affected cluster need to be updated to add a `version.Schema.openAPIV3Schema`. See [#46213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46213).\r\n\r\n## Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- A deprecation toggle has been added to the UI **Apps > Charts** view. When toggled on, you will see all deprecated charts that have been labeled with a `Deprecated` badge. See [#11042](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11042).\r\n- The **Cluster Dashboard** view has replaced the **Install Monitoring** link with a **Cluster Tools** link. Clicking **Cluster Tools** takes you to the UI view to install cluster tools. The **Add Cluster Badge** link in the **Cluster Dashboard** has also been changed, to an icon button with a tooltip to customize appearance. See [#10034](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/pull/10034) and [#9228](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9228).\r\n- Improved Rancher UI navigation menu performance, for environments with many CRDs, namespaces or resource churn. See [#7773](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7773).\r\n- Improved UI performance by supporting a new API feature to independently fetch schemes related to the primary resource. See [#7716](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7716).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where after a user created a resource and is returned to the list view for that resource, a duplicate row was shown. See [#11151](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11151).\r\n- Fixed an issue where global permissions in the UI were displayed in random order. See [#11013](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11013).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The Azure in-tree cloud provider has been removed for Kubernetes versions v1.30 and later. The Rancher UI has a known issue with not properly updating the cloud provider dropdown options for RKE1 and RKE2 clusters running Kubernetes v1.30 and later. As a workaround, you can modify your configuration with the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11363](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11363).\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Added a new setting, `agent-tls-mode`, which allows users to specify if agents will use `strict` certificate verification when connecting to Rancher. The field can be set to `strict` (which requires the agent to verify the certificate using only the Certificate Authority in the `cacerts` setting) or `system-store` (which allows the agent to verify the certificate using any Certificate Authority in the operating system's trust store). This setting will default to `strict` on new installs of v2.9.0+. When upgrading from a prior version, the current value will be kept. For example, when upgrading from 2.8 (where the setting defaults to `system-store`), the value will still be `system-store` after the upgrade to 2.9. See [#45628](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45628).\r\n  **Important:** Agents running on Windows nodes do not yet respect the `agent-tls-mode` setting, but will continue to function as expected. See [#46396](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46396).\r\n\r\n#### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- When `agent-tls-mode` is set to `strict`, users must provide the certificate authority to Rancher or downstream clusters will disconnect from Rancher, and require manual intervention to fix. This applies to several setup types, including:\r\n  - Let's Encrypt - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n  - Bring Your Own Cert - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used to generate the cert and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n  - Proxy/External - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used by the proxy and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n\r\n## Apps\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Air-gapped installations with `useBundledSystemCharts` set to `true` received an update to improve loading and installing apps in the upstream cluster. See [#45280](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45280).\r\n\r\n## RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or k3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and k3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now supports Docker v26.0 and v26.1 for RKE provisioning. See [#45013](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45013) for supporting v26.0 information and [#45439](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45439) for supporting v26.1 information.\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where scaling up etcd nodes in RKE would lead to nodes being stuck waiting to register with Kubernetes. This caused clusters to hang. See [#43356](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43356).\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44857](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44857).\r\n- Weave CNI support for RKE clusters is removed in response to Weave CNI not being supported by upstream Kubernetes v1.30 and later. See [#45954](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45954)\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now provides support for configuring the data directory for RKE2 clusters through the UI **Cluster Configuration > Advanced** tab. Note that values can only be set during cluster creation. See [#45038](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45038) and [#10824](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10824). For known limitations with this feature please note the [section below](./v2.9.md#known-issues-3)\r\n- Added a new annotation, `rke.cattle.io/delete-missing-custom-machines-after`, to enable machine deletion on corresponding Node deletion. Users can set the annotation to the `clusters.provisioning.cattle.io/v1` or `rkecluster.rke.cattle.io` objects. Once set, it causes  missing machines to be deleted after a specified duration (example: `rke.cattle.io/delete-missing-custom-machines-after: '5s'`). See [#43686](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43686).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where scaling down etcd node pools on RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters caused unexpected behavior and clusters to hang in various states. See [#43097](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43097) and [#42582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42582).\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n<!-- Doc Link based on https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/pull/1369 -->\r\n- Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE2 clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44856](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44856).\r\n- Added a new annotation, `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop`. When set to `true`, it drops the `dynamicSchemaSpec` field from machine pool definitions. This prevents cluster nodes from re-provisioning unintentionally when the cluster object is updated from an external source such as Terraform or Fleet. See [#44618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44618).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Currently there are known issues with the [data directory feature](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45038) which are outlined below:\r\n  - Provisioning an RKE2 cluster with the feature enabled causes snapshot restores to fail. See [#46066](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46066).\r\n  - Custom RKE2 clusters need to ensure the environment variable (`CATTLE_AGENT_VAR_DIR`) is configured into the system agent install command as the default variable is missing. A workaround exists to manually specify the `CATTLE_AGENT_VAR_DIR` in the registration command [per this comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46362#issuecomment-2260793382). Currently, node driver provisioned clusters can make use of the data directory. See [#46362](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46362).\r\n  - K3s does not support the data directory feature. See [#10589](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/10589).\r\n  - The `system-agent-upgrader` SUC plan is not applied correctly after cluster provisioning leading to the specified `system-agent` data directory not being used. See [#46361](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46361).\r\n  - Currently selecting `Use the same path for System-agent, Provisioning and K8s Distro data directories configuration` results in Rancher using the same data directory for system agent, provisioning, and distribution components as opposed to appending the specified component names to the root directory. To mitigate this issue, you will need to configure the 3 paths separately and they must follow the guidelines below:\r\n        - Absolute paths (start with /)\r\n        - Clean (not contain env vars, shell expressions, ., or ..)\r\n        - Not set to the same thing\r\n        - Not nested one within another\r\n    See [#11566](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11566).\r\n- When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11435](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11435).\r\n\r\n## Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n<!-- Doc Link based on https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/pull/1311 -->\r\n- Added support for authentication with an Azure AD provider with kubectl through the Rancher CLI. Note you must [allow public client flows](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#4-allow-public-client-flows) to login from Rancher CLI. See [#42939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42939).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The Rancher CLI currently lists the Azure authentication provider options out of order. See [#46128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46128).\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Extended Rancher's Azure AD (aka [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) authentication provider with a filter field which lists the groups attached to a user. When you enable the setting the groups of a user are later filtered down as per the provided clauses. See [#42940](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42940).\r\n  Caution: This filter does not affect the general group listing, only the list of groups for a user. Additionally, if you filter out a group, all permissions the group would have given will not apply. As the filter prevents Rancher from seeing that the user belongs to the group, it also does not see any permissions from that group. This means that filtering can have the side effect of denying users permissions they should have.\r\n- Added authentication support for generic OpenID Connect providers, such as Keycloak and Okta. See [#10053](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/10053).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Upon login using a SAML provider, the `lastLogin` user attribute is now set at login time. See [#46124](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46124).\r\n- An issue was fixed where Rancher was not updating additional groups a user had been added to in their SAML provider. See [#45956](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45956).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n  - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n  - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n  - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Pod Security Admissions (PSA)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Rancher now updates the value of the PSACT `rancher-restricted` to include `cattle-provisioning-capi-system` and `cattle-fleet-local-system` under the `exemptions.namespaces` list. See [#43150](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43150).\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now enables UI extensions to load without the need for authentication. To do so set the extension chart's annotation `noAuth` to `true`. For more information see https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/extensions-configuration#other-configuration-properties. See [#43090](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43090).\r\n- A new [feature flag `uiextensions`](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions#enabling-extension-support-in-rancher) has been added for enabling and disabling the UI extension feature (this replaces the need to install the `ui-plugin-operator`). The first time it's set to `true` (the default value is `true`) it will create the CRD and enable the controllers and endpoints necessary for the feature to work. If set to `false`, it won't create the CRD if it doesn't already exist, but it won't delete it if it does. It will also disable the controllers and endpoints used by the feature. Enabling or disabling the feature flag will cause Rancher to restart. See [#44230](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/44230) and [#43089](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43089).\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- UI extension owners must update and publish a new version of their extensions to be compatible with Rancher v2.9.0 and later. For more information see the [Rancher v2.9 extension support page](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/rancher-2.9-support).\r\n\r\n## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Users can now provide rules that apply only in specific namespaces using the new field `namespacedRules`, which has been added to the `GlobalRules` type. View this [example configuration and context](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42215#issuecomment-1847543482) and see [#42215](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42215) for general information.\r\n- Added the new field, `InheritedFleetWorkspacePermissions`, to the `GlobalRole` type. The field allows users to deploy resources using Fleet in downstream clusters. The Restricted Admin user, which was once needed to deploy resources, is now deprecated and can be replaced by using `InheritedFleetWorkspacePermissions`. Note that Admin or Restricted Admin users can create `GlobalRoles` with `InheritedFleetWorkspacePermissions` that allow users to deploy Fleet resources in all workspaces except `fleet-local`.\r\n  Each `fleetworkspace` has a backing namespace in the local cluster. For a user to be able to deploy resources using Fleet in a downstream cluster they need:\r\n\r\n  - Permissions to deploy Fleet resources in the backing namespace of the `fleetworkspace`. For example, permission to create `GitRepos` in `fleet-default`.\r\n  - Permissions to get `fleetworkspace` cluster-wide resources in the local cluster.\r\n\r\n  Two new fields were added to `GlobalRole` in order to provide access to all Fleet workspaces except `fleet-local`:\r\n\r\n  - `InheritedFleetWorkspacePermissions.ResourceRules`: rules granted in all backing namespaces for all Fleet workspaces excluding `fleet-local`.\r\n  - `InheritedFleetWorkspacePermissions.WorkspaceVerbs`: verbs used to grant permissions to the cluster-wide `fleetworkspace` resources. `ResourceNames` for this rule will contain all Fleet workspace names except `fleet-local`.\r\n  \r\n  View this [example configuration and context](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42170#issuecomment-2186222366) and see [#42170](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42170) for general information.\r\n\r\n## vSphere Charts\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Support for using snapshots to backup vSphere CSI volumes has been fixed by adding a missing `csi-snapshotter` field used by images in the Rancher provided chart configuration. See [#41321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41321).\r\n\r\n## VM Management (Harvester)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug where attempting to provision a Harvester RKE2 cluster and adding two vGPUs would have the provisioning process get stuck in a `starting` state and the VMs would not start. See [#10947](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10947).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- In the Rancher UI when navigating between Harvester clusters of different versions a refresh may be required to view version specific functionality. See [#11559](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11559).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or k3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and k3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.9.0\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.9.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.9.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.6.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.6.0)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n- v1.30.2 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.6\r\n- v1.28.11\r\n- v1.27.15\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n- v1.30.2 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.6\r\n- v1.28.11\r\n- v1.27.15\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - The controller now cleans up instances of `ClusterUserAttribute` that have no corresponding `UserAttribute`. See [#44985](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44985).\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.3:**\r\n  - When Rancher starts, it now identifies all deprecated and unrecognized setting resources and adds a `cattle.io/unknown` label. You can list these settings with the command `kubectl get settings -l 'cattle.io/unknown==true'`. In Rancher v2.9 and later, these settings will be removed instead. See [#43992](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43992).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher Compose is no longer supported, and all parts of it are being removed in the v2.8 release line. See [#43341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43341).\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.23 and v1.24 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.25 or later. See [#42828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42828).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - Docker CLI 20.x is at end-of-life and no longer supported in Rancher. Please update your local Docker CLI versions to 23.0.x or later. Earlier versions may not recognize OCI compliant Rancher image manifests. See [#45424](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45424).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Kontainer Engine v1 (KEv1) provisioning and the respective cluster drivers are now deprecated. KEv1 provided plug-ins for different targets using cluster drivers. The Rancher-maintained cluster drivers for EKS, GKE and AKS have been replaced by the hosted provider drivers, EKS-Operator, GKE-Operator and AKS-Operator. Node drivers are now available for self-managed Kubernetes.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When you provision a downstream cluster, the cluster's name must conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n  - Privilege escalation is disabled by default when creating deployments from the Rancher API. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke1) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#43175](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43175).\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated. Weave will be removed in RKE v1.30. See [#42730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42730).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE2 clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke2) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#42749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42749).\r\n  - Similar to Rancher v2.7.9, when you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0 with provisioned RKE2/K3s clusters in an unhealthy state, you may encounter the error message, `implausible joined server for entry`. This requires manually marking the nodes in the cluster with a joined server. See [#42856](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42856).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster API <!-- highlander -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The `cluster-api` core provider controllers run in a pod in the `cattle-provisioning-cattle-system` namespace, within the local cluster. These controllers are installed with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/rancher/provisioning). Previously, Rancher ran `cluster-api` controllers in an embedded fashion. This change makes it easier to maintain `cluster-api` versioning. See [#41094](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41094).\r\n  - The token hashing algorithm generates new tokens using SHA3. Existing tokens that don't use SHA3 won't be re-hashed. This change affects ClusterAuthTokens (the downstream synced version of tokens for ACE) and Tokens (only when token hashing is enabled). SHA3 tokens should work with ACE and Token Hashing. Tokens that don't use SHA3 may not work when ACE and token hashing are used in combination. If, after upgrading to Rancher v2.7.7, you experience issues with ACE while token hashing is enabled, re-generate any applicable tokens. See [#42062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/42062).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The built-in `restricted-admin` role is being deprecated in favor of a more flexible global role configuration, which is now available for different use cases other than only the `restricted-admin`. If you want to replicate the permissions given through this role, use the new `inheritedClusterRoles` feature to create a custom global role. A custom global role, like the `restricted-admin` role, grants permissions on all downstream clusters. See [#42462](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42462). Given its deprecation, the `restricted-admin` role will continue to be included in future builds of Rancher through the v2.8.x and v2.9.x release lines. However, in accordance with the CVSS standard, only security issues scored as critical will be backported and fixed in the `restricted-admin` role until it is completely removed from Rancher. <!-- Security 1249 -->\r\n  - Reverse DNS server functionality has been removed. The associated [`rancher/rdns-server`](https://github.com/rancher/rdns-server) repository is now archived. Reverse DNS is already disabled by default. <!--Rancher security 1201 -->\r\n  - The Rancher CLI configuration file `~/.rancher/cli2.json` previously had permissions set to `0644`. Although `0644` would usually indicate that all users have read access to the file, the parent directory would block users' access. New Rancher CLI configuration files will only be readable by the owner (`0600`). Invoking the CLI will trigger a warning, in case old configuration files are world-readable or group-readable. See [#42838](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42838).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Helm Chart) <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app in a RKE2/K3s cluster, if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows. Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters.<!-- no issue number --><!-- introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Rancher uses additional trusted CAs when establishing a secure connection to the keycloak OIDC authentication provider. See [#43217](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43217).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting has been replaced by the setting, `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, and is no longer available in the UI. See [#38535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38535).\r\n  - [API tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens) now have default time periods after which they expire. Authentication tokens expire after 90 days, while kubeconfig tokens expire after 30 days. See [#41919](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41919).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - The embedded Cluster API webhook is removed from the Rancher webhook and can no longer be installed from the webhook chart. It has not been used as of Rancher v2.7.7, where it was migrated to a separate Pod. See [#44619](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44619).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher's webhook now honors the `bind` and `escalate` verbs for GlobalRoles. Users who have `*` set on GlobalRoles will now have both of these verbs, and could potentially use them to escalate privileges in Rancher v2.8.0 and later. You should review current custom GlobalRoles, especially cases where `bind`, `escalate`, or `*` are granted, before you upgrade.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - Rancher installs the same pinned version of the `rancher-webhook` chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n  - The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Legacy code for the following v1 charts is no longer available in the [`rancher/system-charts`](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts) repository:\r\n\r\n    - `rancher-cis-benchmark`\r\n    - `rancher-gatekeeper-operator`\r\n    - `rancher-istio`\r\n    - `rancher-logging`\r\n    - `rancher-monitoring`\r\n\r\n    The code for these charts will remain available for previous versions of Rancher.\r\n  - Helm v2 support is deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line and will be removed in Rancher v2.9.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type `Application`. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some necessary actions within Azure AD, causing errors.<!-- no issue number --><!--introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n  - The multi-cluster app legacy feature is no longer available. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - OPA Gatekeeper\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - OPA Gatekeeper is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As a replacement for OPA Gatekeeper, consider [switching to Kubewarden](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/comparisons/opa-comparison). See [#42627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42627).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - A configurable `priorityClass` is available in the Rancher pod and its feature charts. Previously, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - If you use a version of backup-restore older than v102.0.2+up3.1.2 to take a backup of Rancher v2.7.7, the migration will encounter a `capi-webhook` error. Make sure that the chart version used for backups is v102.0.2+up3.1.2, which has `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources removed from the resourceSet. If you can't use v102.0.2+up3.1.2 for backups, delete all `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources from the backup tar before using it. See [#382](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/pull/382).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging. Previously, the default image was Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n    - Rancher aggregates the changed counts and only sends a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n    - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, with a significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s respects the `managedBy` annotation. In its initial release, Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false`, since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Security\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer supported for Rancher app ingresses. See [#42027](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42027).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Extensions\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - The Rancher dashboard fails to load an extension that utilizes backported Vue 3 features, displaying an error in the console `object(...) is not a function`. New extensions that utilize the `defineComponent` will not be backwards compatible with older versions of the dashboard. Existing extensions should continue to work moving forward. See [#10568](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10568).  \r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. This is a benign error that occurs as part of the upgrade process, and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n- **Rancher 2.6.1:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type `ClusterIP` to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port won't be created upon your first attempt to save the new port. You must repeat the procedure to add the port again. The Service Type field will display `Do not create a service` during the second procedure. Change this to `ClusterIP` and save to create the new port. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.4:**\r\n  - RKE2 clusters with invalid values for tolerations or affinity agent customizations don't display an error message, and remain in an `Updating` state. This causes cluster creation to hang. See [#41606](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41606).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.9:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - When provisioning clusters with an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners doesn't take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. As a workaround, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128).<!-- first appears in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.3 as https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689 which redirects to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Amazon ECR Private Registries don't work from RKE2/K3s. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Amazon ECR Private Registries don't work from RKE2/K3s. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920). \r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021)..<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.7.7**:\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n- **Rancher 2.7.2**:\r\n  - When creating a GKE cluster in the Rancher UI you will see provisioning failures as the `clusterIpv4CidrBlock` and `clusterSecondaryRangeName` fields conflict. See [#8749](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8749).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Docker Install <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Single node Rancher won't start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or later. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798) and [#40257](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40257).\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.0:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to longer startup times. When launching Docker for the first time, you'll receive an error message stating, \"Cannot read property `endsWith` of undefined\", as described in [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).  You'll then be directed to a login screen. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Windows <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Issues - Windows Nodes in RKE2 Clusters\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - AKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658#issuecomment-733035658) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.x:**\r\n  - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).<!-- no mention of patch version in issue thread, milestone is simply v2.6, already appear as a longstanding issue in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.0 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - When editing or upgrading an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).<!-- first proposed as a release note for https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561#issuecomment-879272354 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - GKE\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to Kubernetes v1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - The deployment's `securityContext` section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy (PSP) support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).<!-- https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815#issuecomment-1074184973 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The SAML authentication pop-up throws a `404` error on high-availability RKE installations. Single node Docker installations aren't affected. If you refresh the browser window and select **Resend**, the authentication request will succeed, and you will be able to log in. See [#31163](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31163).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.2:**\r\n  - Users on certain LDAP setups don't have permission to search LDAP. When they attempt to perform a search, they receive the error message, `Result Code 32 \"No Such Object\"`. See [#35259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35259).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Encryption\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.4:**\r\n  - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - When provisioning a Harvester RKE1 cluster in Rancher, the **vGPU** field is not displayed under **Cluster Management > Advanced Settings**, this is not a supported feature. However, the **vGPU** field is available when provisioning a Harvester RKE2 cluster. See [#10909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10909).\r\n  - When provisioning a multi-node Harvester RKE2 cluster in Rancher, you need to allocate one vGPU more than the number of nodes you have or provisioning will fail. See [#11009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11009) and v2.9.0 back-port issue [#10989](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10989).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery <!-- fleet --> <!-- use function based naming from https://jira.suse.com/browse/SURE-6864? e.g. \"Continuous Deployment with Fleet?\" -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Target customization can produce custom resources that exceed the Rancher API's maximum bundle size. This results in `Request entity too large` errors when attempting to add a GitHub repo. Only target customizations that modify the Helm chart URL or version are affected. As a workaround, use multiple paths or GitHub repos instead of target customization. See [#1650](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1650).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment, rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancherlabs/release-notes/pull/139-->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.5:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - CIS Scan <!-- neo/security -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Some CIS checks related to file permissions fail on RKE and RKE2 clusters with CIS v1.7 and CIS v1.8 profiles. See [#42971](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42971).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail. The backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion `v1beta1`. There are two workarounds for this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Istio <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- Istio v1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes v1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes v1.23 until the next charts' release.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Read-only project permissions and the View Monitoring role aren't sufficient to view links on the Monitoring index page. Users won't be able to see monitoring links. As a workaround, you can perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n    1. If you haven't already, install Monitoring on the project.\r\n    1. Move the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace into the project.\r\n    1. Grant project users the View Monitoring (`monitoring-ui-view`) role, and `read-only` or higher permissions on at least one project in the cluster.\r\n\r\n    See [#4466](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4466).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts.

fail if disallowed mutations are requested.\r\n* Ext_proc support for observability mode which is \"Send and Go\" mode that can be used by external processor to observe Envoy data and status.\r\n* Added support for flow control in Envoy gRPC side stream.\r\n* TCP Healthchecks can now leverage ProxyProtocol.\r\n* Hot restart: Added new command-line flag to skip hot restart stats transfer.\r\n* HTTP: Added the ability when request mirroring to disable appending of the `-shadow` suffix to the shadowed `host`/`authority` header.\r\n* HTTP: Added the ability to set the downstream request `:scheme` to match the upstream transport protocol.\r\n* HTTP: Envoy now supports proxying `104` headers from upstream.\r\n* Added the ability to bypass the overload manager for a listener.\r\n* Added support for local cluster rate limit shared across all Envoy instances in the local cluster.\r\n* Added Filter State Input for matching HTTP input based on filter state objects.\r\n* Oauth: Added an option to disable setting the ID Token cookie.\r\n* OpenTelemetry enhancements to support extension formatter and stats prefix configuration for the OpenTelemetry logger.\r\n* QUIC stream reset errors are now captured in transport failure reason. Added support for QUIC server preferred address when there is a DNAT between the client and Envoy.\r\n* Added support for Redis inline commands, Bloom 1.0.0 commands, among other commands.\r\n* Added a new retry policy: `reset-before-request`.\r\n* Added support for dynamic direct response for files.\r\n* Added TLS support to match against `OtherName` SAN-type under `match_typed_subject_alt_names`.\r\n* Upstream: Added a new field to `LocalityLbEndpoints`, `LocalityLbEndpoints.Metadata`, that may be used for transport socket matching groups of endpoints.\r\n* Update WASM filter to support use as an upstream filter.\r\n* Disabled OpenCensus by default as it is no longer maintained upstream.\r\n* Ext_proc support for `route_cache_action` which specifies the route action to be taken when an external processor response is received in response to request headers.\r\n* Golang: Move `Continue`, `SendLocalReply` and `RecoverPanic` to `DecoderFilterCallbacks` and `EncoderFilterCallbacks`, to support full-duplex processing.\r\n* Http2 uses Oghttp2 by default.\r\n* Added a \"happy eyeballs\" feature to HTTP/3 upstream, where it assuming happy eyeballs sorting results in alternating address families will attempt the first v4 and v6 address before giving up on HTTP/3.\r\n* Populate typed metadata by default in ProxyProtocol listener.\r\n* Datadog: Disabled remote configuration by default.\r\n* Reject invalid runtime YAML instead of supporting corner cases of bad YAML.\r\n\r\n**Docker images**:\r\n    https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/envoy/tags?page=1&name=v1.31.0\r\n**Docs**:\r\n    https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.31.0/\r\n**Release notes**:\r\n    https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.31.0/version_history/v1.31/v1.31.0\r\n**Full changelog**:\r\n    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/compare/v1.30.0...v1.31.0\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Kevin Baichoo <kbaichoo@netflix.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Ryan Northey <ryan@synca.io>", "created_at": "2024-07-19T17:12:27Z", "project": "Envoy", "repo": "envoyProxy/envoy", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "kustomize/v5.4.3", "tag_name": "kustomize/v5.4.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize/v5.4.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "body": "# Caution\r\nThe `kustomize localize` subcommand(this subcommand is now in the `beta` stage) now verifies the success of `kustomize build` when executed.\r\nIf you are using the missing manifests, maybe you failed to download them with the `localize` subcommand.

signed by legacy cosign. If you want to replicated multiple signatures for a subject image,  please using oci-1.1 mode(cosign v2.2.1+) for signing.\r\n- [known issue #20565](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20565) Issue with SBOM generation in Harbor v2.11.0 when using external Reverse Proxy (HTTP 404)\r\n- [known issue #20691](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20691) LDAP handshake failure with LDAP server has old TLS_RSA_* cipher suites. Workaround: add env variable GODEBUG=\"tlsrsakex=1\"  to common/config/core/env file and restart Harbor.\r\n## Tips\r\n - [Best practice](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-FAQs#notation-signature-accessory) for image singing with [Notation v1.2.0 ](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.2.0-alpha.1) in Harbor \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Exciting New Features \ud83c\udf89\r\n#### SBOM Generation and Management\r\n Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.\r\n> When `Automatically generate SBOM on push` is enabled and there are massive concurrent push to that project, users may need to enable asynchronously updating project quota by setting `core.quotaUpdateProvider: redis` (values.yaml for harbor-helm) or setting [core.quota_update_provider: redis](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/v2.11.0/make/harbor.yml.tmpl#L316) (`harbor.yml` for installation via docker-compose) so that it can reduce the overall resource consumption, like db connection, cpu usage and memory usage.\r\n\r\n#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\nHarbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry\r\nUsers can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation\r\nThe user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by @liubin in

With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.\r\nA successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.\r\nPlease ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.\r\n\r\n### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names\r\n\r\nStarting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:\r\n\r\n- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"utf8-strict-mode\"`.\r\n\r\n- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.\r\n\r\nShould you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"classic-mode\"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-02-28T11:46:46Z", "project": "Alertmanager", "repo": "prometheus/alertmanager", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github",
