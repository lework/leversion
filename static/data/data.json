Following are\r\nthe new built-ins:\r\n\r\n    graphql.is_valid: Checks that a GraphQL query is valid against a given schema\r\n    graphql.parse: Returns AST objects for a given GraphQL query and schema\r\n    graphql.parse_and_verify: Returns a boolean indicating success or failure alongside the parsed ASTs for a given GraphQL query and schema\r\n    graphql.parse_query: Returns an AST object for a GraphQL query\r\n    graphql.parse_schema: Returns an AST object for a GraphQL schema\r\n\r\n### Built-in Function Metadata\r\n\r\nBuilt-in function declarations now support additional metadata to specify name and description for function arguments\r\nand return values. The metadata can be programmatically consumed by external tools such as IDE plugins. The built-in\r\nfunction documentation is created using the new built-in function metadata.\r\nCheck out the new look of the [Built-In Reference](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#built-in-functions)\r\npage!\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, a new file called `builtins_metadata.json` is generated via `make generate` which can be consumed by\r\nexternal tools.\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK, and Runtime\r\n\r\n- OCI Downloader: Add logic to skip bundle reloading based on the digest of the OCI artifact

For more information, see [CVE-2022-21951](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-vrph-m5jj-c46c).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [security advisories page](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Rancher now successfully provisions all downstream cluster types with private registries with the RKE template as expected. See [#37515](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37515).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which a new log was introduced under error level rather than debug level. Note that if conditions occur that result in these log messages, no user intervention is necessary. The buffer will simply be paused from taking any input until it is no longer full. See [#36584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36584).\r\n- After the YAML is directly modified in RKE clusters, support for multiple private registries now functions as expected. See [#37732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/37732).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/requirements/).\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** \r\n  - We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/).\r\n- **Helm version:** \r\n  - Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air-gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** \r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) for information on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and works as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n- **RKE requirements:** \r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)`, please note that Edit and Save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit, and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).  \r\n- **EKS requirements:** \r\n  - There was a setting for Rancher versions prior to 2.5.8 that allowed users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: eks-refresh-cron. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: eks-refresh. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **Fleet-agent:** \r\n  - When upgrading `<=v2.5.7` to `>=v2.5.8`, you may notice that in Apps & Marketplace, there is a fleet-agent release stuck at uninstalling. This is caused by migrating fleet-agent release name. It is safe to delete fleet-agent release as it is no longer used, and doing so should not delete the real fleet-agent deployment since it has been migrated. See [#362](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/362).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Upgrades and Rollbacks:** \r\n  - Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback. Please note the version you would like to upgrade or roll back to change the Rancher version.\r\n  - Please be aware when upgrading to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n  - Existing GKE clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. Refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/#rolling-back-to-rancher-v2-5-0) for the new instructions.\r\n- **Important**: \r\n  - When rolling back, we are expecting you to roll back to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post-upgrade would not be reflected.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off:** \r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. Access to the local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to **true** from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see the documentation.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.5.14\r\n- rancher/rancher-agent:v2.5.14\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.11](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.11)\r\n- RKE - [v1.2.20](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.2.20)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- 1.20.15 (Default)\r\n- 1.19.16\r\n- 1.18.20\r\n- 1.17.17\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Provision Kubernetes v1.16 Clusters** | We have ended support for Kubernetes v1.16. Cluster Manager no longer provisions new v1.16 clusters. If you already have a v1.16 cluster, it is unaffected. |\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced as part of Rancher v2.5.4 through v2.5.10 as an experimental feature but is now deprecated. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only one version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed a feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall it in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General:**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm 3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI.\r\n- **UI Shell:**\r\n  - After closing the shell in the Rancher UI, be aware that the corresponding processes remain running indefinitely for each shell in the pod. See [#16192](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16192).\r\n- **Continuous Delivery:**\r\n  - Restricted admins are not able to create git repos from the Continuous Delivery option under Cluster Explorer; the screen will become stuck in a loading status. See [#4909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4909).\r\n- **Rancher Backup:**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location; it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Monitoring:**\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs. See [#29171](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29171).\r\n- **Istio:**\r\n  - Be aware that when upgrading from Istio v1.7.4 or earlier to any later version, there may be connectivity issues. See [upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#connectivity-issues-among-your-proxies-when-updating-from-1-7-x-where-x-5) and [#31811](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31811).\r\n  - Starting in v1.8.x, [DNS is supported natively](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#istio-coredns-plugin-deprecation). This means that the additional addon component `istioCoreDNS` is deprecated in v1.8.x and is not supported in v1.9x. If you are upgrading from v1.8.x to v1.9.x and you are using the `istioCoreDNS` addon, it is recommended that you disable it and switch to the natively supported DNS prior to upgrade. If you upgrade without disabling it, you will need to manually clean up your installation as it will not get removed automatically. See [#31761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31761) and [#31265](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31265).\r\n  - Istio v1.10 and earlier versions are now End-of-life but are required for the upgrade path in order to not skip a minor version. See [#33824](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33824).\r\n\r\n### Cluster Manager Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n- **GKE:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - When creating GKE clusters in Terraform, the `labels` field cannot be empty: at least one label must be set. See [#32553](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32553).\r\n- **EKS & GKE:**\r\n  - When creating EKS and GKE clusters in Terraform, string fields cannot be set to empty. See [#32440](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32440).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).    \r\n    - After migrating from the in-tree vSphere cloud provider to the out-of-tree cloud provider, attempts to upgrade the cluster will not complete. This is due to nodes containing workloads with bound volumes before the migration failing to drain. Users will observe these nodes stuck in a `draining` state. Follow this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102#issuecomment-943493870) to continue with the upgrade. See [#35102](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#35940](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35940) for more information.  \r\n- **Cluster Tools**\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** \r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster. \r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n    - Monitoring V2 fails to scrape ingress-nginx pods on any nodes except for the one Prometheus is deployed on, if the security group used by worker nodes blocks incoming requests to port 10254. The workaround for this issue is to open up port 10254 on all hosts. See [#32563](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32563).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Logging (Cluster Explorer): Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing Helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio v1.5.\r\n    - [Istio v1.10 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.10-eol-final/) on January 7th, 2022. \r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - In air-gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air-gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n  - **Installation requirements:**\r\n    - Importing a Kubernetes v1.21 cluster might not work properly and is unsupported.\r\n  - **Backup and Restore:**\r\n    - Reinstalling Rancher 2.5.x on the same cluster may fail due to a lingering `rancher.cattle.io.` MutatingWebhookConfiguration object from a previous installation. Manually deleting it will resolve the issue.  \r\n  - **Docker installs:** \r\n    - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. \r\n    - Users may receive an error message when logging in for the first time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).\r\n    - Users may be redirected to the login screen before a password and default view have been set. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-23T21:45:17Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.12.6", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/a1683d3dab164afdfe1bedc8dab296564b7a47e5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.12.6 (#77864)", "created_at": "2022-05-23T15:46:35Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "2.4.2", "tag_name": "2.4.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kong/releases/tag/2.4.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kong", "body": "**Download Kong 2.4.2 and run it now:**\n\n- https://konghq.com/install/\n- [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/kong/)\n\nLinks:\n- [2.4.2 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/2.4.2/CHANGELOG.md#242)", "created_at": "2022-05-23T14:58:32Z", "project": "Kong", "repo": "Kong/kong", "type": "Gateway", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release v1.8.5", "tag_name": "v1.8.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/releases/tag/v1.8.5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery", "body": "## Release date: 2022\u5e7405\u670821\u65e5\r\n\r\n\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4: https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/compare/v1.8.4...v1.8.5\r\n\u8d21\u732e\u8005: @hhyo, @nick2wang and @thcoffee\r\n\r\n- \u89e3\u51b3action\u6784\u5efa\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898 @hhyo (#1534)\r\n- \u5904\u7406clickhouse\u7279\u6b8a\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u95ee\u9898 @nick2wang (#1525)\r\n- \u4fee\u590d\u5bc6\u7801\u542b\u7279\u6b8a\u5b57\u7b26\u4f7f\u7528plugins\u62a5\u9519\u95ee\u9898 @nick2wang (#1519)\r\n- \u66f4\u65b0docker settings @nick2wang (#1502)\r\n- \u4fee\u590d\u5df2\u767b\u5f55\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u80fd\u914d\u7f6e2FA\u95ee\u9898 @nick2wang (#1500)\r\n- \u4fee\u590d\u83b7\u53d6oracle\u56de\u9000sql\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6982\u7387\u5728\u62fc\u5408sql\u51fd\u6570\u683c\u5f0f\u6821\u9a8c\u65f6\u629b\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u3002 @thcoffee (#1499)\r\n- \u4fee\u590d\u5f00\u542fLDAP\u540e2FA\u8ba4\u8bc1\u62a5\u9519\u95ee\u9898 @nick2wang (#1494)\r\n- \u65b0\u589e\u5f3a\u5236\u5168\u5c402FA\u5f00\u5173 @nick2wang (#1490)\r\n- \u4fee\u590doracle\u7684sql\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u5355\u6761\u56de\u9000sql\u8d85\u8fc74000\u957f\u5ea6\u88ab\u5f3a\u5236\u622a\u65ad\u6210\u591a\u6761\u7684\u95ee\u9898 @thcoffee (#1488)\r\n\r\n## \u5347\u7ea7\u6b65\u9aa4\r\n- https://github.com/hhyo/archery/wiki/upgrade\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-21T06:40:17Z", "project": "Archery", "repo": "hhyo/Archery", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.77.2", "tag_name": "v1.77.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.77.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "### Changes\r\n\r\n## [v1.77.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.77.2)\r\n\r\nReleased at 21-05-2022\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): support [reusable templates](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/template_examples/#defining-reusable-templates) for rules annotations. The path to the template files can be specified via `-rule.templates` flag. See more about this feature [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#reusable-templates). Thanks to @AndrewChubatiuk for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2532). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2510).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): expose `vmalert_iteration_interval_seconds` metric at `http://vmalert:8880/metrics`. This metric shows the configured per-group evaluation interval. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2618).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): add `influx-prometheus-mode` command-line flag, which allows to restore the original time series written from Prometheus into InfluxDB during data migration from InfluxDB to VictoriaMetrics. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/vmctl/issues/8). Thanks to @mback2k for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2545).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add ability to specify AWS service name when issuing requests to AWS api. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2605). Thanks to @transacid for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2604).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): fix a bug, which could lead to incomplete discovery of scrape targets in Kubernetes (aka `kubernetes_sd_config`). the bug has been introduced in [v1.77.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1770).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): support `scalar` result type in response. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2607).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): support strings in `humanize.*` template function in the same way as Prometheus does. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2569).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): proxy `/rules` requests to vmalert from Grafana's alerting UI. This removes errors in Grafana's UI for Grafana versions older than `8.5.*`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2583)\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): do not add `/api/v1/query` suffix to `-datasource.url` if `-remoteRead.disablePathAppend` command-line flag is set. Previously this flag was applied only to `-remoteRead.url`, which could confuse users.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): prevent from possible resource leak on config update, which could lead to the slowdown of `vmalert` over time. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2577).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): do not return values from [label_value()](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#label_value) function if the original time series has no values at the selected timestamps.\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): limit the number of concurrently established connections from vmselect to vmstorage. This should prevent from potentially high spikes in the number of established connections after temporary slowdown in connection handshake procedure between vmselect and vmstorage because of spikes in workload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2552).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): fix build for Solaris / SmartOS. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1322#issuecomment-1120276146).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-05-20T23:27:21Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "kyaml/v0.13.7", "tag_name": "kyaml/v0.13.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kyaml/v0.13.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "body": "#4489: Fix containerized function mounts issue\r\n#4568: Openapi parsing performance improvement with protobuffer\r\n#4577: Fix error message using replacement wildcard and `create` option\r\n#4591: Added code for fields with dots(.) in their names work as needed\r\n#4629: Fn framework: bugfix for schema providers + configurable template extensions\r\n#4635: Fix: Testing code leaked to production\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-20T18:39:12Z", "project": "Kustomize", "repo": "kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "type": "Config", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess v12.0.4", "tag_name": "v12.0.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v12.0.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "# Release of Vitess v12.0.4\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n### Cluster management\r\n\r\nA race condition #9819 that happens when running `PlannedReparentShard` was fixed through #9859.\r\n\r\n### Query Serving\r\n\r\nTwo major bugs on `UNION` are fixed via this release.

Helm 3.9.0 updated its use of Kubernetes packages and that included a breaking change to `Factory`, as defined by [the Go stance on interfaces](https://go.dev/blog/module-compatibility).

Public Namespaces List View\r\n\r\nA public namespaces list view is added to the apollo homepage, users could now view and search public namespaces.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/162551466-b86a0a18-a0b4-45bd-af6c-e0de774fa339.png)\r\n\r\n### Grayscale Label Support\r\n\r\nGrayscale rules now support matching with labels for scenarios where IP is not fixed, e.g. Kubernetes.\r\nFor more information on how to use this feature, please refer [apollo user guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/zh/usage/apollo-user-guide?id=_54-%e9%85%8d%e7%bd%ae%e7%81%b0%e5%ba%a6%e8%a7%84%e5%88%99).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/162551723-93224fba-03e0-472e-a68c-95538d31185d.png)\r\n\r\n###  Enhanced Config Export/Import\r\n\r\nThe batch config export/import feature is enhanced.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/162551803-a611bcb0-1430-45c0-b80e-3e2e1545ba59.png)\r\n\r\nThe export/import feature is also enabled for each namespace.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/837658/162551845-f0010279-1877-469f-a2da-b52f6b084395.png)\r\n\r\n### Unique Constraint Index\r\n\r\nPreviously, Apollo doesn't have unique constraint indices due to the soft delete design. However, there might be problems in concurrent situations. With the new `DeletedAt` columns, unique indices are added for most of the tables. There are some manual steps for existing users to upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nAs was discussed in #3896, apollo-client drops java 1.7 support since the 2.0.0 release. The minimum Java runtime environment is 1.8(for both client and server).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* switch apollo.config-service log from warning to info level by @lonre in

By default, kOps will set ShutdownGracePeriod to 30 seconds and ShutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods to 10 seconds if the Kubernetes version is above 1.21.\r\n\r\n* By enabling the [pod identity webhook](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#pod-identity-webhook), you no longer need to modify your Pod specs to assume IAM roles.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Weave CNI is not supported for Kubernetes 1.23 or later.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 has been removed (replaced by Rocky Linux 8).\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now has `disable-cnp-status-updates: true` by default. Set this to false if you rely on the CiliumNetworkPolicy status fields.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.19 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.25.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* The `kops create cluster` command has a new `--discovery-store` flag for specifying a public store for the OIDC-compatible discovery documents.\r\nIf this flag is used in AWS, it will enable IRSA.\r\n\r\n* If `externalDns.provider` is `external-dns`, then `externalDns.watchIngress` will now default to `true`.\r\n\r\n* This release introduces a `v1alpha3` API version. This API version is a work in progress and is likely to be replaced in kOps 1.24.\r\nIt is recommended to keep using the `v1alpha2` API version.\r\n\r\n* IPv6 pod subnets is in a working state using public IPv6 addresses for the Pod network. This works with both Cilium and Calico. IPv6 is still behind a feature flag until service controllers and addons implement support for IPv6. See [the IPv6 documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/networking/ipv6/).\r\n\r\n* The `kops rolling-update cluster` command has a new `--drain-timeout` flag for specifying the maximum amount of time to wait when attempting to drain a node. Previously, rolling-updates would attempt to drain a node for an indefinite amount of time. If `--drain-timeout` is not specified, a default of 15 minutes is applied.\r\n\r\n* Fix inconsistent output of `kops get clusters -ojson`. This will now always return a list (irrespective of a single or multiple clusters) to keep the format consistent. However, note that `kops get cluster dev.example.com -ojson` will continue to work as previously, and will return a single object.\r\n\r\n* Digital Ocean kops now has vpc support. You can specify a `network-cidr` range while creating the kops cluster. kops resources will be created in the new vpc range. Also supports shared vpc; you can specify the vpc uuid while creating kops cluster.\r\n\r\n## 1.23.1 to 1.23.2\r\n\r\n* Use expected pointer type in type assertion when iterating over GS ACLs [@tesspib](https://github.com/tesspib) [#13534](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13534)\r\n* Allow cluster autoscaler to read EC2 instance types to build catalog dynamically [@seh](https://github.com/seh) [#13532](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13532)\r\n* Update Go to v1.17.9 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13551](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13551)\r\n* Add back support for Ubuntu 18.04 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13557](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13557)\r\n* Update Canal's Flannel to v0.15.1 [@tesspib](https://github.com/tesspib) [#13562](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13562)\r\n* Include sysctls in toolbox dump [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13570](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13570)\r\n* Add support for Rocky Linux 8 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13559](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13559)\r\n* Fix OIDC Provider cleanup [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13571](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13571)\r\n* Update containerd to v1.6.3 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13578](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13578)\r\n* Re-add net.bridge settings for flannel [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13564](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13564)\r\n* Revert containerd v1.6.3 upgrade [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13582)\r\n* Fix unexpected type for object metadata when using gossip DNS [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13592](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13592)\r\n* Update containerd to v1.6.4 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13596](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13596)\r\n* Update etcd-manager to v3.0.20220503 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13598](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13598)\r\n* Add hashes for containerd and Docker in order to fix CVE-2022-23648 [@drequena](https://github.com/drequena) [#13606](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13606)\r\n* Avoid \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file loopback for Flatcar Container Linux distribution [@seh](https://github.com/seh) [#13617](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13617)\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-11T06:55:14Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Contour v1.21.0", "tag_name": "v1.21.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.21.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour", "body": "We are delighted to present version v1.21.0 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\nA big thank you to everyone who contributed to the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Major Changes](#major-changes)\r\n- [Minor Changes](#minor-changes)\r\n- [Other Changes](#other-changes)\r\n- [Docs Changes](#docs-changes)\r\n- [Deprecations/Removals](#deprecation-and-removal-notices)\r\n- [Installing/Upgrading](#installing-and-upgrading)\r\n- [Compatible Kubernetes Versions](#compatible-kubernetes-versions)\r\n- [Community Thanks!](#community-thanks)\r\n\r\n# Major Changes\r\n\r\n## Contour leader election resource RBAC moved to namespaced Role\r\n\r\nPreviously, in our example deployment YAML, RBAC for Contour access to resources used for leader election was contained in a ClusterRole, meaning that Contour required cluster-wide access to ConfigMap resources. This release also requires Contour access to Events and Leases which would require cluster-wide access (see [this PR](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/4202)).\r\n\r\nIn this release, we have moved the RBAC rules for leader election resources to a namespaced Role in the example Contour deployment. This change should limit Contour's default required access footprint. A corresponding namespaced RoleBinding has been added as well.\r\n\r\n### Required actions\r\n\r\nIf you are using the example deployment YAML to deploy Contour, be sure to examine and re-apply the resources in `examples/contour/02-rbac.yaml` and `examples/contour/02-role-contour.yaml`. If you have deployed Contour in a namespace other than the example `projectcontour`, be sure to modify the `contour` Role and `contour-rolebinding` RoleBinding resources accordingly. Similarly, if you are using the `--leader-election-resource-namespace` flag to customize where Contour's leader election resources reside, you must customize the new Role and RoleBinding accordingly.\r\n\r\n(#4204, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Container Images Now Exclusively Published on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) \r\n\r\nContour's container images are now exclusively published [on GHCR](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pkgs/container/contour). They are no longer being pushed to Docker Hub (past images have been left on Docker Hub for posterity.)\r\n\r\n(#4314, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Adds a `contour gateway-provisioner` command and deployment manifest for dynamically provisioning Gateways\r\n\r\nContour now has an optional Gateway provisioner, that watches for `Gateway` custom resources and provisions Contour + Envoy instances for them. The provisioner is implemented as a new subcommand on the `contour` binary, `contour gateway-provisioner`. The `examples/gateway-provisioner` directory contains the YAML manifests needed to run the provisioner as a Deployment in-cluster.\r\n\r\nBy default, the Gateway provisioner will process all `GatewayClasses` that have a controller string of `projectcontour.io/gateway-controller`, along with all Gateways for them.\r\n\r\nThe Gateway provisioner is useful for users who want to dynamically provision Contour + Envoy instances based on the `Gateway` CRD.\r\nIt is also necessary in order to have a fully conformant Gateway API implementation.\r\n\r\n(#4415, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## Configurable access log level\r\n\r\nThe verbosity of HTTP and HTTPS access logs can now be configured to one of: `info` (default), `error`, `disabled`. The verbosity level is set with `accesslog-level` field in the [configuration file](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/configuration/#configuration-file) or `spec.envoy.logging.accessLogLevel` field in [`ContourConfiguration`](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/).\r\n\r\n(#4331, @tsaarni)\r\n\r\n## Leader election now only uses Lease object\r\n\r\nContour now only uses the Lease object to coordinate leader election. RBAC in example manifests has been updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Upgrading to this version of Contour will explicitly require you to upgrade to Contour v1.20.0 *first* to ensure proper migration of leader election coordination resources.\r\n\r\n(#4332, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Re-increase maximum allowed regex program size\r\n\r\nRegex patterns Contour configures in Envoy (for path matching etc.) currently have a limited \"program size\" (approximate cost) of 100. This was inadvertently set back to the Envoy default, from the intended 1048576 (2^20) when moving away from using deprecated API fields. Note: regex program size is a feature of the regex library Envoy uses, [Google RE2](https://github.com/google/re2).\r\n\r\nThis limit has now been reset to the intended value and an additional program size warning threshold of 1000 has been configured.\r\n\r\nOperators concerned with performance implications of allowing large regex programs can monitor Envoy memory usage and regex statistics. Envoy offers two statistics for monitoring regex program size, `re2.program_size` and `re2.exceeded_warn_level`. See [this documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/type/matcher/v3/regex.proto.html?highlight=warn_level#type-matcher-v3-regexmatcher-googlere2) for more detail. Future versions of Contour may allow configuration of regex program size thresholds via RTDS (Runtime Discovery Service).\r\n\r\n(#4379, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: support for processing a specific Gateway\r\n\r\nContour can now optionally process a specific named `Gateway` and associated routes. This is an alternate way to configure Contour, vs. the existing mode of specifying a `GatewayClass` controller string and having Contour process the first `GatewayClass` and associated `Gateway` for that controller string. This new configuration option can be specified via:\r\n```yaml\r\ngateway:\r\n  gatewayRef:\r\n    namespace: gateway-namespace\r\n    name: gateway-name\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#4410, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway provisioner: add support for more than one Gateway/Contour instance per namespace\r\n\r\nThe Gateway provisioner now supports having more than one Gateway/Contour instance per namespace. All resource names now include a `-<gateway-name>` suffix to avoid conflicts (cluster-scoped resources also include the namespace as part of the resource name). Contour instances are always provisioned in the namespace of the Gateway custom resource itself.\r\n\r\n(#4426, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway provisioner: generate xDS TLS certs directly\r\n\r\nThe Gateway provisioner now generates xDS TLS certificates directly, rather than using a \"certgen\" job to trigger certificate generation. This simplifies operations and reduces the RBAC permissions that the provisioner requires. Certificates will still be rotated each time the provisioner is upgraded to a new version.\r\n\r\n(#4432, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway provisioner: support requesting a specific address\r\n\r\nThe Gateway provisioner now supports requesting a specific Gateway address, via the Gateway's `spec.addresses` field. Only one address is supported, and it must be either an `IPAddress` or `Hostname` type. The value of this address will be used to set the provisioned Envoy service's `spec.loadBalancerIP` field. If for any reason, the requested address is not assigned to the Gateway, the Gateway will have a condition of \"Ready: false\" with a reason of `AddressesNotAssigned`.\r\n\r\nIf no address is requested, no value will be specified in the provisioned Envoy service's `spec.loadBalancerIP` field, and an address will be assigned by the load balancer provider.\r\n\r\n(#4443, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## All ContourConfiguration CRD fields are now optional\r\n\r\nTo better manage configuration defaults, all `ContourConfiguration` CRD fields are now optional without defaults. Instead, Contour itself will apply defaults to any relevant fields that have not been specified by the user when it starts up, similarly to how processing of the Contour `ConfigMap` works today. The default values that Contour uses are documented in the `ContourConfiguration` CRD's API documentation.\r\n\r\n(#4451, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## ContourDeployment CRD now supports additional options\r\n\r\nThe `ContourDeployment` CRD, which can be used as parameters for a Contour-controlled `GatewayClass`, now supports additional options for customizing your Contour/Envoy installations:\r\n\r\n- Contour deployment replica count\r\n- Contour deployment node placement settings (node selectors and/or tolerations)\r\n- Envoy workload type (daemonset or deployment)\r\n- Envoy replica count (if using a deployment)\r\n- Envoy service type and annotations\r\n- Envoy node placement settings (node selectors and/or tolerations)\r\n\r\n(#4472, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Query parameter hash based load balancing\r\n\r\nContour users can now configure their load balancing policies on `HTTPProxy` resources to hash the query parameter on a request to ensure consistent routing to a backend service instance.\r\n\r\nSee [this page](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.21.0/config/request-routing/#load-balancing-strategy) for more details on this feature.\r\n\r\nCredit to @pkit for implementing this feature!\r\n\r\n(#4508, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Allow the contour --ingress-class-name value to be a comma-separated list of classes to match against.  Contour will process Ingress and HTTPProxy objects with any of the specified ingress classes. (Note that the alpha ContourConfiguration CRD has also been changed to use a ClassNames array field instead of a scalar ClassName field.) (#4109, @erwbgy)\r\n- Don't check for or log errors for unsupported annotations on objects that Contour doesn't care about (e.g. ingresses for a different class than Contour's). (#4304, @skriss)\r\n- Explicitly disable controller-runtime manager metrics and health listeners. (#4312, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Removed code duplication for the secret validation in the dag package. (#4316, @alessandroargentieri)\r\n- Node labels in `localhost:6060/debug/dag` troubleshooting API are sanitized by html-escaping user fields. (#4323, @kb000)\r\n- Upstream TCP connection timeout is now configurable in [configuration file](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/configuration/#timeout-configuration) and in [`ContourConfiguration`](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1alpha1.TimeoutParameters). (#4326, @tsaarni)\r\n- Drops RBAC and caching for the `networking.k8s.io/IngressClass` resource as it's not used by Contour. (#4329, @skriss)\r\n- Fixed a bug where upstream TLS SNI (`HTTProxy.spec.routes.requestHeadersPolicy` `Host` key) and protocol fields might not take effect when e.g. two `HTTPProxies` were otherwise equal but differed only on those fields. (#4350, @tsaarni)\r\n- New field `HTTPProxy.spec.routes.timeoutPolicy.idleConnection` was added. The field sets timeout for how long the upstream connection will be kept idle between requests before disconnecting it. (#4356, @tsaarni)\r\n- Update github.com/prometheus/client_golang to v1.11.1 to address CVE-2022-21698. (#4361, @tsaarni)\r\n- Envoy's [`merge_slashes`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-merge-slashes) option that enables\r\na non-standard path transformation option to replace multiple consecutive slashes in an URL path with a single slash can now be disabled by setting the `DisableMergeSlashes` option in the Contour config file or ContourConfiguration custom resource. (#4363, @mszabo-wikia)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.21.1. See the [Envoy changelog](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.21.1/version_history/current) for details. (#4365, @skriss)\r\n- Add base implementation for RTDS (Runtime Discovery Service). This will be used to enable dynamic configuration of Envoy Runtime settings. (#4380, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Ensure controller-runtime logging is properly configured to log to Contour's logrus Logger instance. (#4391, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Adds an optional `--name-prefix` flag to the `contour certgen` command which, if specified, will be added as a prefix to the names of the generated Kubernetes secrets (e.g. `myprefix-contourcert` and `myprefix-envoycert`). (#4394, @skriss)\r\n- Moved all usages of header_match and exact_match with string_match (#4397, @rajatvig)\r\n- Use the protocol field from the Cluster when performing the health check (#4398, @rajatvig)\r\n- Removed the hack for ImagePullPolicy for certgen (#4402, @rajatvig)\r\n- internal/envoy: Enable gzip compression for grpc-web content types. (#4403, @bourquep)\r\n- In the example manifests, leave `imagePullPolicy` as `Always` on main branch and only change to `IfNotPresent` on release branches/release-tagged manifests. (#4406, @rajatvig)\r\n- Upgrade to Go 1.18.0. (#4412, @skriss)\r\n- Add grpc_stats filter for Envoy\r\nAdd the ability to log \"grpc_status\" to the Envoy access log (#4424, @rajatvig)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: set the GatewayClass \"Accepted\" condition based on the validity of its parametersRef, if it has one. Also only reconciles Gateways for GatewayClasses with \"Accepted: true\". (#4440, @skriss)\r\n- The Gateway provisioner now provisions a `ContourConfiguration` resource instead of a `ConfigMap` for describing Contour's configuration. (#4454, @skriss)\r\n- Uses the `ContourConfigurationSpec` defined as part of a `GatewayClass's` `ContourDeployment` parameters when provisioning a `ContourConfiguration` for a `Gateway`. (#4459, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: set appropriate conditions on Listeners if they don't specify the same port as other Listeners for their protocol group (i.e. HTTP, or HTTPS/TLS) or don't have a unique hostname within their group. (#4462, @skriss)\r\n- Add a example to show how to do blue-green deployment under Gateway-API mode (#4466, @izturn)\r\n- Fix improper use of OriginalIPDetectionFilter in HTTPConnectionManager. Reverts back to XffNumTrustedHops setting which was un-deprecated in Envoy 1.20. (#4470, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: change default controller name to `projectcontour.io/gateway-controller`. (#4474, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: when an `HTTPRoute` or `TLSRoute` has a cross-namespace backend ref that's not permitted by a `ReferencePolicy`, set the reason for the `ResolvedRefs: false` condition to `RefNotPermitted` instead of `Degraded`. (#4482, @skriss)\r\n- Add support for Contour to produce logs in JSON format by specifying `--log-format=json` command line switch. (#4486, @tsaarni)\r\n- Use typed config for all Envoy extensions in place of well-known names or internal type URL constants, for consistency and forwards-compatibility. (#4487, @skriss)\r\n- Updates to Envoy 1.22.0. See the [Envoy release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.22.0/version_history/current) for more information. (#4488, @skriss)\r\n- Updates Gateway API to v0.4.3 and adds the Gateway API validating webhook to Contour's Gateway API example YAML. (#4489, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: adjusts logic for finding intersecting hostnames between a Listener and a Route to ignore non-matching hosts rather than reporting an error for them. (#4505, @skriss)\r\n- Upgrade to Go 1.18.1. (#4509, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Remove `ContourConfiguration` kubebuilder enum validations, and add equivalent validations in Contour code. (#4511, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: fixes a bug where a route would be marked \"Accepted: false\" with reason \"NoIntersectingHostnames\" if it did not have intersecting hostnames with _every_ Listener. Now, as long as the route's hostnames intersect with at least one Listener, it's accepted. (#4512, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- The AWS NLB deployment guide has been updated, and the annotations `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type` has been change to `external`. It should now work correctly with the given YAMLs. (#4347, @yankay)\r\n- Added documentation for HTTPProxy request redirection. (#4367, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Add `pathType` field to Ingress resource. (#4446, @lou-lan)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remove leader election configuration from configuration file\r\n\r\nLeader election configuration via configuration file was deprecated in Contour v1.20.0.\r\nConfiguration of leader election lease details and resource must now be done via command line flag.\r\n\r\n(#4340, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.21.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.21 through 1.23.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.2.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 1.0.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.2.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.9.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.6.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.6.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.9.0 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.9.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.10 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* [Data populator](https://github.com/openebs/data-populator) (alpha)\r\n* Add support for log and log streams for upgrade jobs for Jiva\r\n* added manager errors for Jiva for better debuggability \r\n* fixed Jiva controller issue where service does not select controller pods\r\n* fixed NDM issue where disk partition cannot be released after creating lvm\r\n* fixed concurrent map write issue in cstor-csi\r\n* fixed OpenEBS security vulnerablility in github action\r\n* added node selector and toleration to ndm exporter\r\n* fixed xfs quota issue for LVM volumes in dynamic-localpv\r\n* made ZFS-LocalPV aware of pool import\r\n* fixed cstor-csi to avoid simultaneous creation and deletion of resource\r\n* enahanced LVM-LocalPV to pick the node for provisioning the volume where there is enough free space available\r\n* honor klog logging options for dynamic-localpv\r\n\r\nIn-Progress items \r\n\r\n* shared volume group support for LVM-LocalPV (https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/184)\r\n* CNCF infra migration (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3511)\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @RytisLT(Rytis Ilciukas) for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/adopters/users/RytisLT/README.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?
