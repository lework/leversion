The schema is used when type checking the policy so that invalid references to (or operations on) `input` data are caught at compile time. In the future, the schema support will be expanded to accept multiple schemas and rule-level annotations. See the new [Schemas](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/schemas/) documentation for details. Authored by @[aavarghese](https://github.com/aavarghese) and @[vazirim](https://github.com/vazirim).\r\n- The `eval`, `test`, `bench` and REPL subcommands now supports a `-t`/`--target` flag to set the evaluation engine to use. The default engine is `rego` referring to the standard Rego interpreter in OPA. Users can now select `wasm` to enable Wasm compilation and execution of policies ([#2878](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2878)).\r\n- The `eval` subcommand now supports a `raw` option for `-f`/`--format` that is useful in bash scripts. Authored by @[jaspervdj-luminal](https://github.com/jaspervdj-luminal).\r\n- The test framework now supports \"skippable\" tests. Prefix the test name with `todo_` to have the test runner skip the test, e.g., `todo_test_allow { ... }`.\r\n- The `eval` subcommand now correctly supports the `--ignore` flag. Previously the flag was not being applied.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n- The `POST /v1/compile` API now supports a `?metrics` query parameter similar to other APIs. Authored by @[jkbschmid](https://github.com/jkbschmid).\r\n- The directory used for persisting downloaded bundles can now be configured. See the [Configuration](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/) page for details.\r\n- The HTTP Decision Logger plugin no longer blocks server shutdown for the grace period when there are no logs to upload.\r\n- The Bundle plugin now unregisters listeners correctly. This issue would cause listeners to be invoked when bundle updates were dispatched even if the listener was unregistered ([#3190](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3190)).\r\n- The server now correctly decodes policy IDs in the HTTP request URL. Authored by @[mattmahn](https://github.com/mattmahn) ([#2116](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2116)).\r\n- The server now configures the `http_request_duration_seconds` metric (for all of the server endpoitns) with smaller, more granular buckets that better map to actual response latencies from OPA.  Authored by @[luong-komorebi](https://github.com/luong-komorebi) ([#3196](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3196)).\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\n- PKCS8 keys are now supported when signing bundles and communicating with control plane services. Previously only PKCS1 keys were supported ([#3116](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3116)).\r\n- The built-in OPA HTTP API authorizer policy can now return a _reason_ to explain why a request to the OPA API is denied ([#3056](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3056)). See the [Security](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/security/) documentation for details. Thanks to @[ajanthan](https://github.com/ajanthan) for helping improve this.\r\n\r\n### Compiler\r\n\r\n- The compiler can be configured to emit debug messages that explain comprehension indexing decisions. Debug messages can be enabled when running `opa build` with `--debug`.\r\n- A panic was fixed in one of the rewriting stages when comprehensions were used as object keys ([#2915](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2915))\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\n- A bug in big integer comparison was fixed. This issue was discovered when comparing serial numbers from X.509 certificates. Authored by @[andrehaland](https://github.com/andrehaland) ([#3147](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3147)).\r\n- The `io.jwt.decode_verify` function now uses the environment supplied time-of-day value instead of calling `time.Now()` ([#3105](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3105)).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- The documentation now includes a dedicated section the OPA-Envoy integration. See [https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/) for details.\r\n- The ecosystem page now ranks integrations by number of unique domains instead of the sheer number of references.\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\n- The `data` document no longer needs to be initialized to an empty object ([#3130](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3130)).\r\n- The mpd library is now initalized by the module's `Start` function ([#3110](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3110)).\r\n- The planner now longer re-plans rules blindly when `with` statements are encountered ([#3150](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3150)).\r\n- The planner and compiler now support dynamic dispatch. Previously the planner would enumerate all functions and invocation was controlled at runtime ([#2936](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2936)).\r\n- The compiler now inserts memoization instructions into function bodies instead of at callsites. This reduces the number of wasm instructions in the resulting binary ([#3169](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3169)).\r\n- The wasmtime runtime is now the default runtime used by OPA to execute compiled policies. The new runtime no longer leaks memory when policies are reloaded.\r\n- The planner and compiler now intern strings and booleans and implement a few micro-optimizations to reduce the size of the resulting binary.\r\n- The capabilities support has been updated to include an ABI major and minor version for tracking backwards compatibility on compiled policies ([#3120](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3120)).\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- The `opa test` subcommand previously supported a `-t` flag as shorthand for `--timeout`. With this release, the `-t` shorthand has been redefined for `--target`. After searching GitHub for examples of `opa test -t` (and finding nothing) we felt comfortable making this backwards incompatible change.\r\n- The Go version used to build the OPA release has been updated from `1.14.9` to `1.15.8`. Because of this, TLS certificates that rely on Common Name for verification are no longer supported and will not work.

Specially crafted URLs to these API endpoints could include JavaScript which would be embedded in the page and execute in a browser. There is no direct mitigation. Avoid clicking on untrusted links to your Rancher server. [#31583](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31583)\r\n\r\n### Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n- Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213)\r\n- Rancher HA cluster should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5.\r\n- If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/)\r\n- The [local cluster can no longer be turned off](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster), which means all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin)\r\n\r\n#### Docker Install\r\n\r\n- When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the docs for more info](https://staging.rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n- When installing in an air gap environment, you must supply a custom registries.yaml file to the Docker run command as shown in the [k3s docs](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229)\r\n- There are UI issues around startup time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes 1.19 + firewalld\r\n\r\n- For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840)\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n- Added support for Kubernetes v1.20\r\n- Added ability to set environment variables to the agent in order to support downstream clusters behind a proxy [#31370](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31370) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/options/#agent-environment-variables)\r\n- Added the ingress.enabled rancher Helm flag. When set to false, Helm will not install a Rancher ingress. Set the option to false to deploy your own ingress. [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/chart-options/#advanced-options)\r\n- **EKS**\r\n  - Added ability to use launch templates for EKS managed node groups [#30019](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30019) [#30020](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30020) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/eks/#bring-your-own-launch-template)\r\n- **Node Pool Enhancements**\r\n  - Added ability to select which node to delete when scaling down a node pool [#22871](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/22871)\r\n  - Added an ability to select drain on delete to be used when scaling down node pools [#27458](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27458)\r\n- **vSphere out of tree cloud provider** - Added ability to configure the vSphere external cloud provider through the Apps and Marketplace in the Cluster Explorer. By using the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) and Cloud Storage Interface (CSI) charts, the vsphere out-of-tree provider can be configured. Note: Your cluster must have the cloud provider set as `external` in order for the cluster to allow out-of-tree provider configuration. For those already using the vSphere in-tree provider, migrations docs are available. [#20131](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/20131) [#23357](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23357) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/vsphere/out-of-tree/)\r\n- **RKE**\r\n  - Added ability to set `PriorityClassName` on RKE addons [#30047](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30047)\r\n  - Added ability to configure timeout value for the etcd backup job [#30663](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30663)\r\n- **Continuous Delivery**\r\n  - Previously any new charts for Fleet would automatically be deployed into any existing Rancher install, as of v2.5.6, we've added the ability to put a minimum version for Fleet charts so they wouldn't automatically be deployed [#30934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30934)\r\n- **Windows**\r\n  - Added ability to deploy onto Windows 2004 and 20H2 Servers [#27451](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27451) [#30701](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30701) [#30808](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30808)\r\n  - Added ability to run Fleet on Windows clusters [#30516](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30516)\r\n- **Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)** is now available as a cluster driver and new Kubernetes clusters can be spun up directly with LKE. The cluster driver is inactive by default and will need to be activated to appear as an option.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Features\r\n\r\n- **Logging**\r\n  - Added support for being able to configure resource settings [#31099](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31099)\r\n\r\n### Cluster Manager Tools\r\n\r\n- Added minimum CPU and memory to monitoring and Istio charts to prevent the charts from being installed on clusters without enough resources [#30684](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30684) [#30144](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30144)\r\n\r\n- **Logging**\r\n  - Added 3.9.0 [#30917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30917)\r\n  - Added ability to mount certs on fluentd [#29784](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29784)\r\n- **Istio**\r\n  - Added v1.8.3 [#29812](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29812) [#31187](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31187) [#30410](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30410)\r\n- **OPA Gatekeeper**\r\n  - Updated to GA [#31203](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31203)\r\n  - Added v3.3.0 [#31204](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31204)\r\n\r\n## Major Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Rancher server chart couldn't be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster without an ingress [#30535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30535)\r\n- Fixed an issue where etcd would have increased traffic and memory usage after upgrading [#30168](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30168)\r\n- Fixed an issue where public Helm chart repository were not working on clusters behind a proxy [#29961](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29961)\r\n- Fixed an issue where telemetry client had a socket leak and cause upgrade issues or general k8s issues  [#28360](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28360) [#27870](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27870)\r\n- Fixed an issue where vSphere vCenter server entries from the in-tree cloud provider configuration would not be removed [#30606](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30606)\r\n- Fixed an issue where the cluster private registry was not working with the rancher-agent image for clusters provided by node drivers [#30605](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30605)\r\n- Fixed an issue where EC2 node provisioning failed when using a SLES15 AMI [#30717](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30717)\r\n- Fixed an issue where nodes wouldn't drain before deleting when scaling down if the node had pods with emptyDir volumes [#31455](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31455)\r\n- Fixed an issue where RKE clusters would get stuck when there were `Cordoned` worker nodes and starting to remove master nodes [#30049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30049)\r\n- Fixed an issue where clusters couldn't be imported with the kubernets-python-client due to additional `---` at the end of the the import file[#31252](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31252)\r\n- Fixed an issue where imported clusters would return 404s from the agent [#15172](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/15172)\r\n- Fixed an issue where windows nodes failed to create RKE log directory if `prefixPath` was not set [#30966](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30966)\r\n- Fixed an issue where monitoring in Cluster Explorer wasn't working on Windows server-core versions [#27911](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27911)\r\n- Fixed an issue when configuring OpenLDAP with StartTLS [#30930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30930)\r\n- Fixed an issue with Fleet where GitRepos and clusters would get stuck in a `Modified` state [#30696](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30696)\r\n- Fixed an issue with Fleet where adding a Git repo with uppercase letters in the path would fail [#30792](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30792)\r\n- Fixed an issue where the logging in the Cluster Manager UI was previously failing on new AKS clusters [#30425](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30425)\r\n- Fixed an issue where the logging in Cluster Explorer was not working with non-standard Docker root directory [#30329](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30329)\r\n- Fixed an issue where the display name was incorrect when nodes in a single cluster have FQDN hostnames under multiple different subdomains. [#27873](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27873)\r\n- Fixed an issue where ClusterRoleBinding's apiVersion would log deprecation warning for any k8s 1.19 clusters [#30043](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/)\r\n- Fixed a list of UI issues [within Cluster Manager](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av2.5.6+label%3Ateam%2Fui+) and [within Cluster Explorer](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av2.5.6+is%3Aclosed)\r\n\r\n## UI Updates\r\n\r\nThe primary UI in Rancher since v2.0 is now referred to as Cluster Manager in the UI. The new Cluster Explorer dashboard, experimentally released in Rancher 2.4, has graduated to GA status. There are new features only available in the new Cluster Explorer dashboard. There are some new features in the new UI with similar functionality as existing features in Cluster Manager, but differences in implementation may cause differences details may cause variation.\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only 1 version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed the feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n |**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n- Kubernetes v1.20 has an issue with the vSphere in-tree cloud provider. Rancher supports the out-of-tree vSphere cloud provider starting as of v2.5.6, which is when k8s 1.20 support was introduced. [#31172](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31172)\r\n- Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539)\r\n- Logging in the cluster explorer may not capture all kubelet logs for cloud providers. [#30383](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30383)\r\n- Istio 1.5.10 is not supported in air gapped environments.\r\n- In air-gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run the Monitoring in Cluster Manager v0.1.x. Clusters running k8s 1.15 and below will need to upgrade their k8s versions and leverage Monitoring in Cluster Manager v0.2.x or upgrade to Monitoring in Cluster Explorer.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI\r\n  - The new Logging and Monitoring features do not yet work with windows clusters. [#28721](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28721) [#28327](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28327)\r\n- **Rancher Backup**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location, it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n  - Rancher Continuous Delivery (Fleet) is not handled during backup. [Backup#69](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/issues/69)\r\n- **Monitoring**\r\n  - There is a known issue with using Rancher Monitoring to monitor etcd nodes in RKE clusters that use a mix of RancherOS hosts and non-RancherOS hosts for etcd [#29815](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29815).\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs.

This means Prometheus 1.6 support has been removed and the oldest Prometheus version supported in the remote write is 1.7. #3682\r\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed the flag `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration-deprecated` which was deprecated in 1.4.0. Please use the `ruler_evaluation_delay_duration` per-tenant limit instead. #3694\r\n* [CHANGE] Removed the flags `-<prefix>.grpc-use-gzip-compression` which were deprecated in 1.3.0: #3694\r\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-ruler.client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-ruler.client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-bigtable.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-bigtable.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-ingester.client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-ingester.client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier: it's not required to set `-frontend.query-stats-enabled=true` in the querier anymore to enable query statistics logging in the query-frontend. The flag is now required to be configured only in the query-frontend and it will be propagated to the queriers. #3595 #3695\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: compactor is now required when running a Cortex cluster with the blocks storage, because it also keeps the bucket index updated. #3583\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: block deletion marks are now stored in a per-tenant global markers/ location too, other than within the block location. The compactor, at startup, will copy deletion marks from the block location to the global location. This migration is required only once, so you can safely disable it via `-compactor.block-deletion-marks-migration-enabled=false` once new compactor has successfully started once in your cluster. #3583\r\n* [CHANGE] OpenStack Swift: the default value for the `-ruler.storage.swift.container-name` and `-swift.container-name` config options has changed from `cortex` to empty string. If you were relying on the default value, you should set it back to `cortex`. #3660\r\n* [CHANGE] HA Tracker: configured replica label is now verified against label value length limit (`-validation.max-length-label-value`). #3668\r\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: `extend_writes` field in YAML configuration has moved from `lifecycler` (inside `ingester_config`) to `distributor_config`. This doesn't affect command line option `-distributor.extend-writes`, which stays the same. #3719\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Deprecated `-cluster.` CLI flags in favor of their `-alertmanager.cluster.` equivalent. The deprecated flags (and their respective YAML config options) are: #3677\r\n  * `-cluster.listen-address` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.listen-address`\r\n  * `-cluster.advertise-address` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.advertise-address`\r\n  * `-cluster.peer` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.peers`\r\n  * `-cluster.peer-timeout` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout`\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: the default value of `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.sync-interval` has been changed from `5m` to `15m`. #3724\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Queries can be federated across multiple tenants. The tenants IDs involved need to be specified separated by a `|` character in the `X-Scope-OrgID` request header. This is an experimental feature, which can be enabled by setting `-tenant-federation.enabled=true` on all Cortex services. #3250\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: introduced the experimental option `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled` to shard tenants across multiple Alertmanager instances. This feature is still under heavy development and its usage is discouraged. The following new metrics are exported by the Alertmanager: #3664\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_ring_check_errors_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_sync_configs_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_sync_configs_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_tenants_discovered`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_tenants_owned`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow specifying JAEGER_ENDPOINT instead of sampling server or local agent port. #3682\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: introduced a per-tenant bucket index, periodically updated by the compactor, used to avoid full bucket scanning done by queriers, store-gateways and rulers. The bucket index is updated by the compactor during blocks cleanup, on every `-compactor.cleanup-interval`. #3553 #3555 #3561 #3583 #3625 #3711 #3715\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: introduced an option `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled` to enable the usage of the bucket index in the querier, store-gateway and ruler. When enabled, the querier, store-gateway and ruler will use the bucket index to find a tenant's blocks instead of running the periodic bucket scan. The following new metrics are exported by the querier and ruler: #3614 #3625\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_loads_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_load_failures_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_load_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_loaded`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: exported the following metrics. #3583 #3625\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_count`: Total number of blocks per tenant in the bucket. Includes blocks marked for deletion, but not partial blocks.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_marked_for_deletion_count`: Total number of blocks per tenant marked for deletion in the bucket.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_partials_count`: Total number of partial blocks.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_last_successful_update_timestamp_seconds`: Timestamp of the last successful update of a tenant's bucket index.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `cortex_prometheus_last_evaluation_samples` to expose the number of samples generated by a rule group per tenant. #3582\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: add status page (/memberlist) with available details about memberlist-based KV store and memberlist cluster. It's also possible to view KV values in Go struct or JSON format, or download for inspection. #3575\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: client can now keep a size-bounded buffer with sent and received messages and display them in the admin UI (/memberlist) for troubleshooting. #3581 #3602\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: added block index attributes caching support to metadata cache. The TTL can be configured via `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.metadata-cache.block-index-attributes-ttl`. #3629\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add support for Azure blob storage. #3634\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: tenants marked for deletion will now be fully cleaned up after some delay since deletion of last block. Cleanup includes removal of remaining marker files (including tenant deletion mark file) and files under `debug/metas`. #3613\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: retry compaction of a single tenant on failure instead of re-running compaction for all tenants. #3627\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Implement result caching for tenant query federation. #3640\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] API: Add a `mode` query parameter for the config endpoint: #3645\r\n  * `/config?mode=diff`: Shows the YAML configuration with all values that differ from the defaults.\r\n  * `/config?mode=defaults`: Shows the YAML configuration with all the default values.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OpenStack Swift: added the following config options to OpenStack Swift backend client: #3660\r\n  - Chunks storage: `-swift.auth-version`, `-swift.max-retries`, `-swift.connect-timeout`, `-swift.request-timeout`.\r\n  - Blocks storage: ` -blocks-storage.swift.auth-version`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.max-retries`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.connect-timeout`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.request-timeout`.\r\n  - Ruler: `-ruler.storage.swift.auth-version`, `-ruler.storage.swift.max-retries`, `-ruler.storage.swift.connect-timeout`, `-ruler.storage.swift.request-timeout`.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Disabled in-memory shuffle-sharding subring cache in the store-gateway, ruler and compactor. This should reduce the memory utilisation in these services when shuffle-sharding is enabled, without introducing a significantly increase CPU utilisation. #3601\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Shuffle sharding: optimised subring generation used by shuffle sharding. #3601\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New /runtime_config endpoint that returns the defined runtime configuration in YAML format. The returned configuration includes overrides. #3639\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: included the parameter name failed to validate in HTTP 400 message. #3703\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fail to startup Cortex if provided runtime config is invalid. #3707\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add flags to customize the cluster configuration: #3667\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.gossip-interval`: The interval between sending gossip messages. By lowering this value (more frequent) gossip messages are propagated across cluster more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.push-pull-interval`: The interval between gossip state syncs. Setting this interval lower (more frequent) will increase convergence speeds across larger clusters at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: change the error message returned when a received series has too many label values. The new message format has the series at the end and this plays better with Prometheus logs truncation. #3718\r\n  - From: `sample for '<series>' has <value> label names; limit <value>`\r\n  - To: `series has too many labels (actual: <value>, limit: <value>) series: '<series>'`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve bucket index loader to handle edge case where new tenant has not had blocks uploaded to storage yet. #3717\r\n* [BUGFIX] Allow `-querier.max-query-lookback` use `y|w|d` suffix like deprecated `-store.max-look-back-period`. #3598\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: Entry in the ring should now not appear again after using \"Forget\" feature (unless it's still heartbeating). #3603\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: do not close idle TSDBs while blocks shipping is in progress. #3630 #3632\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: correctly update `cortex_ingester_memory_users` and `cortex_ingester_active_series` when a tenant's idle TSDB is closed, when running Cortex with the blocks storage. #3646\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix default value incorrectly overriding `-querier.frontend-address` in single-binary mode. #3650\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: delete `deletion-mark.json` at last when deleting a block in order to not leave partial blocks without deletion mark in the bucket if the compactor is interrupted while deleting a block. #3660\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: do not cleanup a partially uploaded block when `meta.json` upload fails. Despite failure to upload `meta.json`, this file may in some cases still appear in the bucket later. By skipping early cleanup, we avoid having corrupted blocks in the storage. #3660\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: disable access to `/alertmanager/metrics` (which exposes all Cortex metrics), `/alertmanager/-/reload` and `/alertmanager/debug/*`, which were available to any authenticated user with enabled AlertManager. #3678\r\n* [BUGFIX] Query-Frontend: avoid creating many small sub-queries by discarding cache extents under 5 minutes #3653\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Ensure the stale markers generated for evaluated rules respect the configured `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration`. This will avoid issues with samples with NaN be persisted with timestamps set ahead of the next rule evaluation. #3687\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: don't serve HTTP requests until Alertmanager has fully started. Serving HTTP requests earlier may result in loss of configuration for the user. #3679\r\n* [BUGFIX] Do not log \"failed to load config\" if runtime config file is empty. #3706\r\n* [BUGFIX] Do not allow to use a runtime config file containing multiple YAML documents. #3706\r\n* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker: don't track as error in the `cortex_kv_request_duration_seconds` metric a CAS operation intentionally aborted. #3745", "created_at": "2021-02-23T17:26:08Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v15.2.9", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ceph/ceph/commits/357616cbf726abb779ca75a551e8d02568e15b17", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ceph/ceph", "body": "15.2.9", "created_at": "2021-02-23T14:10:15Z", "project": "Ceph", "repo": "ceph/ceph", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v0.21.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/knative/serving/commits/b9576f56c67dd42801243ca3978f495fba857d6a", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "Add the same decoding Revision logic to request_log as context_handler (#10824)", "created_at": "2021-02-23T12:47:46Z", "project": "Knative", "repo": "knative/serving", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.2.0", "tag_name": "v2.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor", "body": "## What's New \r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n* **System Level Robot Account**\r\n   - Introduce system-level robot accounts to enable them to access multiple projects.\r\n   - Support for Aqua CSP Scanner\r\n   - Selective API access for robot accounts\r\n   - $sign removed from robot accounts names\r\n\r\n* **Metrics & Observability**\r\nEnable Harbor to expose performance & system information indicators to provide observability.\r\n\r\n* **OIDC Admin Group**\r\nAllows specifying a special privileged admin group for OIDC auth, achieving parity with LDAP auth\r\n\r\n* **Additional Features**\r\n   - Migrate GC/Scan all/Tag Retention and Replication to task manager/scheduler.\r\n   - Enhance the proxy cache to support Google Container Registry(GCR), Elastic Container Registry(ECR), Azure Container Registry(Azure), Quay.io.\r\n   - Support Dell EMC ECS s3.\r\n   - Bump up Trivy 0.14, support pluggable scanner spec v1.1.(https://github.com/goharbor/pluggable-scanner-spec)\r\n   - Refine project manage & robot API to support both project ID & Name as indicator.\r\n   - Golang v1.15.6. Harbor is now built using Golang v1.15.6 as of this release.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Considerations\r\n- **Certificate Impact**:  Since Harbor is compiled by Golang v1.15.6, the certificates may need to be updated. Go `1.15.0` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates are generated by Harbor prepare script. For more information, see Go GitHub issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39568.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n   - Deprecate built-in Clair.  Users still have the option to install Clair in out-of-tree fashion by pairing with Harbor through its interrogation services framework.\r\n   - The ChartMuseum is scheduled to be deprecated in a future v2.4.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n- **API**:  The `/systeminfo` API now displays less information when the request is triggered by an unauthenticated user.  For details please  refer to the following issue comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/9149#issuecomment-733662106\r\n- **Scan Report**:  After upgrading to v2.2, all scan reports in the previous version have been deleted due to changes in the vulnerability database scheme.

We highly suggest to upgrade to this new version.\r\n\r\n**Notable Features:**\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\ude80 Support for jitter and custom strings in health checks.\r\n* Fixed charts in the GUI in multi-zone.\r\n* CNI and VM improvements.\r\n* And much more!\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Also check the [upgrade path](https://github.com/Kong/kuma/blob/master/UPGRADE.md).\r\n\r\n**Download and Run:**\r\n\r\n* [**Try Kuma 1.0.8**](https://kuma.io/install/1.0.8/)", "created_at": "2021-02-19T12:01:06Z", "project": "kuma", "repo": "Kong/kuma", "type": "ServiceMesh", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.19.1", "tag_name": "v1.19.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/tag/v1.19.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops", "body": "kOps 1.19.1 is the latest in the 1.19 series, with support for kubernetes 1.19.\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n* **Terraform users on AWS should read the [_Required Actions_](#required-actions) section below to avoid potential etcd data loss.**\r\n\r\n* 1.19.1 no longer blocks containerd with kubenet, kopeio, gce and external networking modes; this limitation was specific to 1.19.0 only.\r\n\r\n## Changes to kubernetes config export\r\n\r\nkOps will no longer automatically export the kubernetes config on `kops update cluster`. In order to export the config on cluster update, you need to either add the `--user <user>` to reference an existing user, or `--admin` to export the cluster admin user. If neither flag is passed, the kubernetes config will not be modified. This makes it easier to reuse user definitions across clusters should you, for example, use OIDC for authentication.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `kops export kubecfg` will also require passing either the `--admin` or `--user` flag if the context does not already exist.\r\n\r\nBy default, the credentials of any exported admin user now have a lifetime of 18 hours. The lifetime of the exported\r\ncredentials may be specified as a value of the `--admin` flag. To get the previous behavior, specify `--admin=87600h` to either `kops update cluster` or `kops export kubecfg`.\r\n\r\n`kops create cluster --yes` exports the admin user along with rest of the cluster config, as was the previous behaviour (except for the 18-hour validity).\r\n\r\n## ARM64 support\r\n\r\nkOps will install ARM64 artifacts and containerd images when the instance group supports ARM64 for both machine type and OS image. At the moment this is known to work with AWS m6g, c6g, r6g and t4g instances, with the latest Ubuntu 20.04 OS images for ARM64.\r\n\r\n## OpenStack Cinder plugin\r\n\r\nkOps will install the Cinder plugin for kOps running kubernetes 1.16 or newer. If you already have this plugin installed you should remove it before upgrading.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a default `StorageClass`, you should set `cloudConfig.Openstack.BlockStorage.CreateStorageClass: false` to prevent kOps from installing one.\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes by kind\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n* New clusters will now have one nodes group per zone. The number of nodes now defaults to the number of zones.\r\n\r\n* On AWS kOps now defaults to using launch templates instead of launch configurations.\r\n\r\n* There is now Alpha support for Hashicorp Vault as a store for secrets and keys. See the [Vault state store docs](/state/#vault-vault).\r\n\r\n* The lifetimes of certificates used by various components have been substantially reduced.\r\nThe certificates on a node will expire sometime between 455 and 485 days after the node's creation.\r\nThe expiration times vary randomly so that nodes are likely to have their certs expire at different times than other nodes.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports using an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) for API access.\r\nSee the [documentation](/cluster_spec/#load-balancer-class) for more info.\r\n\r\n* Allow users to partially compress user-data, check the instance groups docs for more details.\r\n\r\n* Worker nodes on AWS will now be bootstrapped using kops-controller.\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n* The `kops update cluster` command will now refuse to run on a cluster that\r\nhas been updated by a newer version of kOps unless it is given the `--allow-kops-downgrade` flag.\r\n\r\n* New command for deleting a single instance: [kops delete instance](/docs/cli/kops_delete_instance/)\r\n\r\n### CNI\r\n\r\n* Clusters using the Amazon VPC CNI provider now perform an `ec2.DescribeInstanceTypes` call at instance launch time. In large clusters or AWS accounts this may lead to API throttling which could delay node readiness. If this becomes a problem please open a GitHub issue.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico with `CrossSubnet` enabled will switch to the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) for disabling the [AWS source/destination checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck). The previous implementation using [k8s-ec2-srcdst](https://github.com/ottoyiu/k8s-ec2-srcdst) is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now enable the [eBPF dataplane](https://docs.projectcalico.org/about/about-ebpf) mode for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.bpfEnabled: true` and `spec.kubeProxy.enabled: false` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now encrypt pod-to-pod traffic with [WireGuard](https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic) for Ubuntu hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.wireguardEnabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Cilium now enable BPF NodePort by default if the Kubernetes version is 1.12 or newer.\r\n\r\n### Addons\r\n\r\n* Metrics Server is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.metricsServer.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cluster Autoscaler is now availalble as a configurable addon. Add `spec.clusterAutoscaler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* AWS Node Termination Handler is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.nodeTerminationHandler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cilium will enable `enable-remote-identity` by default. This can affect network policies. If you want to keep old behaviour, add `spec.networking.cilium.enableRemoteIdentity: false` in your cluster spec.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes 1.9 and 1.10 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions has been removed. This removal may be temporarily deferred to kOps 1.20 by setting the `LegacyIAM` feature flag.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* See note about [Openstack Cinder plugin](#openstack-cinder-plugin) above.\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS, in order to prevent downtime you will have to remove the state of any existing ELB or TargetGroup attachments from your Terraform state file. This is due to migrating the attachments to the in-line `aws_autoscaling_group` fields. See the [terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group) for more information about the difference. This migration is required due to a bug described in [#9913](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9913).\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_autoscaling_attachment | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS migrating clusters from Launch Configurations to Launch Templates may need to remove the state of the old Launch Configuration. This is due to potential errors with Terraform attempting to delete the Launch Configuration before updating the AutoScalingGroup to use the Launch Template. The Launch Configurations will need to be manually deleted afterwards.\r\n  More information including detailed remediation steps is available in [#10017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/10017).\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_launch_configuration | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure launch configurations are not being destroyed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename their EBS Volume resources to match 0.12's stricter naming requirements. Volumes whose Terraform resource name begin with a digit are now prefixed with `ebs-`. This change will be made regardless of `Terraform-0.12` feature flag value. More information is available in [#9982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9982).\r\n  When upgrading to kOps 1.19, follow these steps to determine if a rename is necessary:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Look for any EBS volumes being recreated\r\n  # Adjust these arguments as necessary\r\n  terraform state mv aws_ebs_volume.1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local aws_ebs_volume.ebs-1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Confirm no EBS volumes being changed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If you are using Terraform with an additional .tf file and using \"aws_autoscaling_attachment\" to attach additional Load Balancers or ALB/NLB Target Groups you'll need to migrate to [attaching them through the InstanceGroup spec instead](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#externalloadbalancers).\r\n\r\n* AWS clusters using an ACM Certificate on the API ELB (`.spec.api.loadBalancer.sslCertificateID`) will need to migrate from Classic LoadBalancer (CLB) to Network LoadBalancer (NLB) prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19 by setting `.spec.api.loadBalancer.class: Network`.\r\n  Any kubeconfig files using kOps' admin client credentials will need to be regenerated with `kops export kubecfg --admin`.\r\n  For more information see [this page](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/permalinks/acm_nlb.md).\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.11 and 1.12 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker container runtime has been deprecated and will be replaced with containerd for new clusters as of kOps 1.20. For existing clusters the default behaviour can be overridden by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd` in the cluster spec. This change closely tracks the upstream [deprecation of Docker](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker).\r\n\r\n* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20. All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The experimental node authorizor is now ignored if you are using kubernetes 1.19.

frequently-occurring `WARN` level log messages have been downgraded to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to not clutter terminal output.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `Created` field of `podman ps --format=json` was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) ([#9315](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9315)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the `podman images` command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `--cgroups=split` did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail ([#9393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9393)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume ([#9415](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/9415)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the `--entrypoint=[\"\"]` option to `podman run` and `podman create` as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored ([#9377](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9377)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would set the `HOME` environment variable to `\"\"` when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory ([#9378](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9378)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause `podman pod create` to panic ([#9374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9374)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--runtime` option was not properly handled by the `podman build` command ([#9365](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9365)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed ([#9387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9387)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would incorrectly escape `%t` when generating the path for the PID file ([#9373](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9373)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, when run inside a Podman container with the host's containers/storage directory mounted into the container, erroneously detect a reboot and reset container state if the temporary directory was not also mounted in ([#9191](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9191)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some options of the `podman build` command (including but not limited to `--jobs`) were nonfunctional ([#9247](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9247)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a breaking change to the Libpod Wait API for Containers where the Conditions parameter changed type in Podman v3.0 ([#9351](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9351)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle forwarded ports that did not specify a host port.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Wait endpoint for Containers could write duplicate headers after an error occurred.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Images would not pull images that already had a matching tag present locally, even if a more recent version was available at the registry ([#9232](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9232)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the `docker-java` library.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.19.4\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-18T20:16:12Z", "project": "Podman", "repo":

This driver is released as alpha and currently supports the following additional features compared to the non-CSI jiva volumes. \r\n   * Jiva Replicas are backed by OpenEBS host path volumes\r\n   * Auto-remount of volumes that are marked read-only by iSCSI client due to intermittent network issues\r\n   * Handle the case of multi-attach error sometimes seen on on-premise clusters\r\n   * A custom resource for Jiva volumes to help with easy access to the volume status\r\n   \r\n  For instructions on how to set up and use the Jiva CSI driver, please see. https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator.\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Several bug fixes to the Mayastor volumes along with improvements to the API documentation. See [Mayastor release notes](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor/releases/tag/v0.7.1). \r\n- Enhanced the [NFS Dynamic Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) to support using Cluster IP for dynamically provisioned NFS server. It was observed that on some of the Kubernetes clusters the kubelet or the node trying to mount the NFS volume was unable to resolve the cluster local service. \r\n- [ZFS Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) added support for resizing of the raw block volumes. \r\n- [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) is enhanced with additional features and some key bug fixes like:\r\n  * Raw block volume support\r\n  * Snapshot support\r\n  * Ability to schedule based on the capacity of the volumes provisioned\r\n  * Ensure that LVM volume creation and deletion functions are idempotent\r\n- NDM partition discovery was updated to fetch the device details from its parent block device.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue with cStor helm chart w.r.t to CVC operator service that was causing velero restores to fail. (https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/pull/239)\r\n- Fixed an issue with cStor CSPC validation causing failures in creating pools with ZFS supported compression algorithms. (https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/issues/237)\r\n- Fixed an issue with the cStor validation webhook not getting deleted in K8s 1.20+ when the OpenEBS namespace is deleted. https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3338)\r\n- Fixed an issue with Jiva replicas attempting duplicate registration if the Pod IP of the replica changes. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3323)\r\n- Fixed an issue where Jiva cleanup jobs can't be executed when cluster PSP is restrictive. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3331)\r\n- Fixed an issue where cStor pool migration from SPC to CSPC could result in pool failure when migration takes time and the user tries to restart the SPC pool. (https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/issues/82)\r\n- Fixed an issue with NDM partition discovery causing errors when partitions were present on top of filtered devices like OS disk. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3321)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.17 or higher release is recommended as this release contains the following updates that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n  * The CSI components have been upgraded to: \r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-attacher:v3.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-node-driver-registrar:v2.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-provisioner:v2.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-resizer:v1.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-snapshotter:v4.0.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/snapshot-controller:v4.0.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-snapshotter:v3.0.3 (for cStor CSI volumes)\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/snapshot-controller:v3.0.3 (for cStor CSI volumes)\r\n\r\n- If you are upgrading from an older version of cStor operators to this version, you will need to manually delete the cStor CSI driver object prior to upgrading. `kubectl delete csidriver cstor.csi.openebs.io`. For complete details on how to upgrade your cStor operators, see https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/upgrade.md#cspc-pools.\r\n\r\n- The CRD API version has been updated for the cStor custom resources to v1. If you are upgrading via the helm chart, you might have to make sure that the new CRDs are updated. https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/tree/master/deploy/helm/charts/crds\r\n\r\n- The e2e pipelines include upgrade testing only from 1.5 and higher releases to 2.6. If you are running on release older than 1.5, OpenEBS recommends you upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- OpenEBS has applied for becoming a CNCF incubation project and is currently undergoing a Storage SIG review of the project and addressing the review comment provided. One of the significant efforts we are taking in this direction is to upstream the changes done in uZFS to OpenZFS. \r\n- Automation of further Day 2 operations like -  automatically detecting a node deletion from the cluster, and re-balancing the volume replicas onto the next available node. \r\n- Migrating the CI pipelines from Travis to GitHub actions. \r\n- Several enhancements to the cStor Operators documentation with a lot of help from @survivant.\r\n- PSP support has been added to ZFS Local PV and cStor helm charts.\r\n- Improving the [OpenEBS Rawfile Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) in preparation for its beta release. In the current release, fixed some issues as well as added support for setting resource limits on the sidecar and few other optimizations.\r\n- Sample Grafana dashboards for managing OpenEBS are being developed here: https://github.com/openebs/charts/tree/gh-pages/grafana-charts\r\n\r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @coboluxx (IDNT) for becoming a public reference and supporter of OpenEBS by sharing your use case on [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS? You can help OpenEBS in its journey towards becoming a CNCF Incubation project by sharing your OpenEBS story and join the league of [OpenEBS Adopters](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2719).\r\n\r\n### Shout outs!\r\n\r\n_MANY THANKS_ to our existing contributors and for everyone helping OpenEBS Community going. \r\n\r\nA very special thanks to our  **first-time** contributors to code, tests, and docs:  @luizcarlosfaria, @Z0Marlin, @iyashu, @dyasny, @hanieh-m, @si458, @Ab-hishek\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite to install\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.17+ or newer release is installed. \r\n- Make sure that you run the below installation steps with the cluster-admin context. The installation will involve creating a new Service Account and assigning it to OpenEBS components.\r\n- Make sure [iSCSI Initiator](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html) is installed on the Kubernetes nodes.\r\n- Node-Disk-Manager (NDM) helps in discovering the devices attached to Kubernetes nodes, which can be used to create storage pools. If you like to exclude some of the disks from getting discovered, update the filters in [NDM Config Map](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugndm.html) to exclude paths before installing OpenEBS.\r\n- NDM runs as a privileged pod since it needs to access the device information. Please make the necessary changes to grant access to run in privileged mode. For example, when running in RHEL/CentOS, you may need to set the security context appropriately. Refer [Configuring OpenEBS with selinux=on](https://blog.openebs.io/configuring-openebs-to-run-with-security-enhanced-linux-1e5a90a91da2)\r\n\r\n### Install using kubectl\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/2.6.0/openebs-operator.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install using Helm stable charts\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install --namespace openebs --name openebs openebs/openebs --version 2.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details refer to the documentation at https://docs.openebs.io/\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade to 2.6 is supported only from 1.0 or higher and follows a similar process as earlier releases. Detailed steps are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n- Upgrade OpenEBS Control Plane components.\r\n- Upgrade Jiva PVs to 2.6, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n- Upgrade CStor Pools to 2.6 and its associated Volumes, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n\r\nFor upgrading from releases prior to 1.0, please refer to the respective release upgrade [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf you are having issues in setting up or upgrade, you can contact:\r\n- OpenEBS Community for Support on [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io)\r\n    - Already signed up?

If you are using the cStor Storage Engine, please review the following before upgrading to this release.\r\n\r\n- The recommended approach for deploying cStor Pools is using the new custom resource called cStorPoolCluster (CSPC). Even though the provisioning of cStor Pools using StoragePoolClaim(SPC) is supported, it will be deprecated in future releases. The pools provisioned using SPC can be easily migrated to CSPC.  \r\n- When using cStor Pools, make sure that raw block devices are available on the nodes. If the block devices are formatted with a filesystem or mounted, then cStor Pool will not be created on the block device. In the current release, there are [manual steps](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/t-volume-provisioning.html#cstor-pool-pod-not-running) that could be followed to clear the filesystem or use partitions for creating cStor Pools, please reach out to the community (#openebs) at https://slack.k8s.io.\r\n- If you are using cStor pools with ephemeral devices, starting with 1.2 - upon node restart, cStor Pool will not be automatically re-created on the new devices. This check has been put to make sure that nodes are not accidentally restarted with new disks. The steps to recover from such a situation are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/maya/pull/1401#issue-308355304), which involves changing the status of the corresponding CSP to `Init`.\r\n- Capacity over-provisioning is enabled by default on the cStor pools. If you don\u2019t have alerts set up for monitoring the usage of the cStor pools, the pools can be fully utilized and the volumes can get into a read-only state. To avoid this, set up resource quotas as described in https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2855.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-15T17:27:44Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.4.1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/commits/428b97ba52430e69be0b6e92ae795dadf7574dce", "repo_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet", "body": "Merge pull request #8511 from GabrielNagy/fix-gid-idempotency-main\n\n(PUP-10896) Fix gid idempotency on user resource", "created_at": "2021-02-10T16:34:53Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.21.0 \"Savannah Ash\"", "tag_name": "v0.21.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.21.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 WhenExpressions and Results in Finally Tasks \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.21.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.21.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.21.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.21.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.21.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n* Requires Kubernetes 1.17+ to run\r\n* The controller now requires that the SYSTEM_NAMESPACE environment variable is set.

Users are strongly recommended to update to this release. It fixes two security issues in upstream dependencies and one security issue in the Helm codebase.\r\n\r\nPlease review the following security advisories for context:\r\n\r\n- During an audit, Helm core maintainers discovered sanitization issues [described in a security advisory](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c38g-469g-cmgx). These have been fixed.\r\n- GoUtils (via Sprig) updated the [random alphanumeric functions](https://github.com/Masterminds/goutils/security/advisories/GHSA-xg2h-wx96-xgxr) used in Helm templates. Thanks to Open Source Developer Erik Sundell of Sundell Open Source Consulting AB for reporting this issue.\r\n- ORAS had a [security release](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c38g-469g-cmgx) that does not appear to directly impact Helm. However, we have merged it as a precaution.\r\n- The Go team renamed a crypto library (golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal to golang.org/x/term). This was NOT a security fix. But it was a breaking change to the Helm build.\r\n\r\n> **WARNING:** Helm is now stricter about sanitizing data in `Chart.yaml`, `index.yaml`, and `plugin.yaml`. In particular, we are stricter about SemVer strings.\r\n\r\nThe community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there!\r\n\r\n- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\r\n  -  for questions and just to hang out\r\n  -  for discussing PRs, code, and bugs\r\n- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/696660622)\r\n- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [GitHub/helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Upgrading\r\n\r\nDownload Helm v3.5.2.

were introduced!\r\n- A new command was added, `thanos tools bucket rewrite`, enabling the deletion of series from given block.\r\n- The Query Frontend now supports proxying requests to the `labels` and `series` API endpoints.\r\n- `thanos tools bucket replicate` can now copy particular blocks by ID.\r\n- The number of series touched by the Store component when servicing a `Series` call can now be limited using a CLI flag.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#3380](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3380) Mixin: Add block deletion panels for compactor dashboards.\r\n- [#3568](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3568) Store: Optimized inject label stage of index lookup.\r\n- [#3566](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3566) StoreAPI: Support label matchers in labels API.\r\n- [#3531](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3531) Store: Optimized common cases for time selecting smaller amount of series by avoiding looking up symbols.\r\n- [#3469](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3469) StoreAPI: Added `hints` field to `LabelNamesRequest` and `LabelValuesRequest`. Hints are an opaque data structure that can be used to carry additional information from the store and its content is implementation-specific.\r\n- [#3421](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3421) Tools: Added `thanos tools bucket rewrite` command allowing to delete series from given block.\r\n- [#3509](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3509) Store: Added a CLI flag to limit the number of series that are touched.\r\n- [#3444](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3444) Query Frontend: Make POST request to downstream URL for labels and series API endpoints.\r\n- [#3388](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3388) Tools: Bucket replicator now can specify block IDs to copy.\r\n- [#3385](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3385) Tools: Bucket prints extra statistics for block index with debug log-level.\r\n- [#3121](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3121) Receive: Added `--receive.hashrings` alternative to `receive.hashrings-file` flag (lower priority). The flag expects the literal hashring configuration in JSON format.\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- [#3567](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3567) Mixin: Reintroduce `thanos_objstore_bucket_operation_failures_total` alert.\r\n- [#3527](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3527) Query Frontend: Fix query_range behavior when start/end times are the same\r\n- [#3560](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3560) Query Frontend: Allow separate label cache\r\n- [#3672](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3672) Rule: Prevent crashing due to `no such host error` when using `dnssrv+` or `dnssrvnoa+`.\r\n- [#3461](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3461) Compact, Shipper, Store: Fixed panic when no external labels are set in block metadata.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#3496](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3496) S3: Respect SignatureV2 flag for all credential providers.\r\n- [#2732](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2732) Swift: Switched to a new library [ncw/swift](https://github.com/ncw/swift) providing large objects support.\r\n   By default, segments will be uploaded to the same container directory `segments/` if the file is bigger than `1GB`.\r\n   To change the defaults see [the docs](./docs/storage.md#openstack-swift).\r\n- [#3626](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3626) Shipper: Failed upload of `meta.json` file doesn't cause block cleanup anymore. This has a potential to generate corrupted blocks under specific conditions. Partial block is left in bucket for later cleanup.", "created_at": "2021-01-27T11:25:36Z", "project": "Thanos", "repo": "thanos-io/thanos", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess 9.0.0", "tag_name": "v9.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v9.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "This release complies with VEP-3 which removes the upgrade order requirement. Components can be upgraded in any order. It is recommended that the upgrade order should still be followed if possible, except to canary test the new version of VTGate before upgrading the rest of the components.\r\n\r\n## Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\nThe following PRs made changes to behaviors that clients might rely on. They should be reviewed carefully so that client code can be changed in concert with a Vitess release deployment.\r\n* The update to golang 1.15 (#7204) might break systems that use TLS certificates with a common name. A fix is documented here (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40748#issuecomment-673612108)\r\n\r\nVitess 9.0 is not compatible with the previous release of the Vitess Kubernetes Operator (2.2.0).

There are [some system variables](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/sysvars/sysvars.go#L147,L190) which are disabled by default and can be enabled using flag `-enable_system_settings` on VTGate. These system variables are set on the mysql server. Because they change the mysql session, using them leads to the Vitess connection no longer using the connection pool and forcing dedicated connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n### VReplication\r\n\r\n* VReplication: refactored and enhanced support for JSON columns #6829\r\n* VReplication: Don't update tx timestamp on heartbeat #6930\r\n* VReplication E2E Tests: Refactored tests for readability and attempting to fix flakiness #6991\r\n* VRepl/Tablet Picker: improve observability of selected tablet #6999\r\n* VReplication: Handle comment statement type in vstreamer #7092\r\n* VReplication e2e: Fine tuned test to reduce flakiness and added more logging to debug future flakiness #7138\r\n* VReplication: Make relay log size & rows configurable. #6992\r\n* VReplication: New workflows cli UX.

"body": "In `v0.10.0` the most important changes we're \"shipping\" are about improving sustainability:\r\n\r\n- Doubled the set of project owners, granting @aojea & @amwat full access to help maintain the project.\r\nA huge thank you to them for their existing contributions and for stepping up here :heart:\r\n- Rewritten and revamped contributor guide https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/getting-started/\r\n\r\nAdditionally we're trying a new approach to tracking [priorities for v0.11.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2024) which you can see in our issue tracker.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we've made a number of bug fixes and minor improvements.\r\n\r\nSome users may appreciate the ability to run kind v0.10.0 (NOT the currently installed v0.7.0) in the free [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) for quick demos, workshops, etc.\r\n\r\nSimply install kind somewhere under $HOME and add it to your $PATH to use it in cloud shell:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGO111MODULE=on go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.10.0\r\nexport PATH=\"$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}\"\r\nkind create cluster\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo persist this `PATH` for future usage you can edit your `$HOME/.bashrc` in cloudshell.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.20.2` image: `kindest/node:v1.20.2@sha256:8f7ea6e7642c0da54f04a7ee10431549c0257315b3a634f6ef2fecaaedb19bab`\r\n- We're only actively supporting Kubernetes `v1.14.0`+, however limited best effort functionality still encompases `v1.13.0` for now.\r\n- Images from KIND `v0.8.0+` should continue to work for now, but lack various improvements.\r\n- udev is explicitly disabled at the node level, though as always please try not to depend on the inner details of nodes beyond providing a particular Kubernetes version with kind\r\n- IPv6 pod subnet defaults to /56 instead of /64 (a necessary fix for newer Kubernetes, see #1903)\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- `kind export logs` now includes the kind version\r\n- Node images compiled without dockershim for Kubernetes v1.19+ possible, reducing size\r\n- Reduced kind binary size further (~7MB) with improved build options\r\n- Improved zsh completion\r\n- Experimental github actions CI for podman, docker, cgroupsv2\r\n- Expanded WSL2 documentation\r\n- Revamped contributor guide\r\n- Improved docs site implementation, including table of contents generation\r\n- Updated dependencies\r\n- New Loadbalancer user guide\r\n- Better support for running in nested container environments when using images built with v0.10.0+\r\n  - This enables cloud shell support\r\n\r\nNew Node images have been built for kind `v0.10.0`, please use these **exact** images (IE like `v1.20.2:@sha256:8f7ea6e7642c0da54f04a7ee10431549c0257315b3a634f6ef2fecaaedb19bab` including the digest) or build your own as we may need to

Native RWX support (experimental)\r\n    1. See [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/) for documentation.\r\n1. ARM64 support (experimental)\r\n    1. Longhorn now supports ARM64 architecture in addition to AMD64. You can deploy Longhorn as usual in ARM64 without any modification.\r\n1. [CSI Snapshotter support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/)\r\n    1. CSI Snapshotter is a new beta feature since Kubernetes v1.17. It allows users to create snapshots for volumes directly using the `kubectl` command. In Longhorn's context, those `CSI snapshots` will be mapped into `backups`. So after we add the support, Longhorn users will be able to create/restore backups for the volumes without using the Longhorn UI.\r\n1. [Prometheus support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/monitoring/)\r\n    1. We've added Prometheus endpoints and an example Grafana dashboard.\r\n    1. Now the users can easily use the existing monitoring solution to collect stats about the Longhorn, as well as set up alerts for certain situations.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n1. Enhanced failure recovery during Kubernetes node failure\r\n    1. [Automatic recovery for the StatefulSets](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/node-failure/#pod-deletion-policy-when-node-is-down).\r\n    1. [Improved recovery mechanism for volume failure](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/recover-volume/).\r\n    1. Rebuild based on existing replica after the node temporarily disconnected.\r\n1. [Better node maintenance support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/volumes-and-nodes/maintenance/)\r\n    1. Automatically remove node when the node has been removed from Kubernetes.\r\n    1. Automatically recognized the existing disk on another node (e.g. reattached EBS on a different EC2 instance).\r\n    1. Support Kubernetes `drain`.\r\n    1. Support manually pause replica rebuild for server maintenance.\r\n    1. Support replica eviction for the nodes/disks.\r\n1. Support [`Data Locality` option](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/data-locality/) to always keep a replica local to the engine.\r\n    1. The data locality feature will always try to keep a replica local to the workload, which guarantees even when the network interruption happens, the volume will continue working for the local workload.\r\n1. [Allow volume creation with degraded availability](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/references/settings/#allow-volume-creation-with-degraded-availability)\r\n    1. If the value is **true**, Longhorn will not prevent the volume creation as long as there is at least one replica has been scheduled successfully. It will help users with less than 3 nodes environment. Longhorn will automatically start rebuilding replicas if more available space on other nodes is found later.\r\n    1. The default value is **true**. Recommend value for **the production environment: false**.\r\n1. Improvement performance via removing revision counter (experimental).\r\n\r\n# Release note\r\n1. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn v1.1.0 is **v1.16**.\r\n2. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn with CSI Snapshotter is **v1.17**.\r\n    1. Please follow the instruction [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/) to install the CSI Snapshot Controller in your Kubernetes cluster if you want to use the CSI snapshot feature. \r\n1. Experimental features:\r\n    1. For the experimental features in this release, we will continue working on improving them. We don't recommend using the experimental features in production.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade\r\nLive upgrade from v1.0.x is supported.

If you are happy with the help you've had these last over 5 years, please ensure you've [starred our repo](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/stargazers) or drop by to say thanks on [gitter](https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin).\r\n\r\nIf you have time to help us continue to serve others, please stop by on gitter with a suggestion of what you'd like to help with or a request for what might be a neat way to start. Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
