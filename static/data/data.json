It can be safely removed from alerting templates, since `\\n` chars are properly escaped with other `*Escape` functions now. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3139) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/890) issue for details.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY: update Go builder to v1.19.3. This fixes [CVE-2022 security issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56328). See [the changelog](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.19.3+label%3ACherryPickApproved).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: properly register new time series in per-day inverted index if they were ingested during the last 10 seconds of the day. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3309). Thanks to @lmarszal for the bugreport and for the [initial fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3320).\r\n* BUGFIX: properly accept [OpenTSDB telnet put lines](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-telnet-put-protocol) without tags without the need to specify the trailing whitespace. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3290).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly merge buckets with identical `le` values, but with different string representation of these values when calculating [histogram_quantile](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#histogram_quantile) and [histogram_share](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#histogram_share). For example, `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le=\"5\"}` and `http_requests_duration_seconds_bucket{le=\"5.0\"}`. Such buckets may be returned from distinct targets. Thanks to @647-coder for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3225).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): change severity level for log messages about failed attempts for sending data to remote storage from `error` to `warn`. The message for about all failed send attempts remains at `error` severity level.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): properly escape string passed to `quotesEscape` [template function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#template-functions), so it can be safely embedded into JSON string. This makes obsolete the `crlfEscape` function. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3139) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/890) issue.\r\n* BUGFIX: `vmselect`: expose missing metric `vm_cache_size_max_bytes{type=\"promql/rollupResult\"}` . This metric is used for monitoring rollup cache usage with the query `vm_cache_size_bytes{type=\"promql/rollupResult\"} / vm_cache_size_max_bytes{type=\"promql/rollupResult\"}` in the same way as this is done for other cache types.\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-11-10T12:04:02Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v18.0.180", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/chef/commits/f0a6aa4c3728a4f7679892eecf3cb9100fbe8b07", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chef/chef", "body": "Bump version to 18.0.180 by Chef Expeditor\n\nObvious fix; these changes are the result of automation not creative thinking.", "created_at": "2022-11-10T04:45:03Z", "project": "Chef", "repo": "chef/chef", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "v1.25.1", "tag_name": "v1.25.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.25.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk", "body": "## v1.25.1\n\n### Additions\n\n- For `operator-sdk bundle validate`: When checking for Kubernetes APIs deprecated in Kubernetes v1.25.0 the ClusterServiceVersion's CustomResourceDefinitions,  ClusterPermissions, and Permissions are now validated to ensure no references to  deprecated APIs are being made.

This is the case with nodes early in the boot process.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6303](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6303)\r\n\r\n  * When a plugin was enabled as a dependency (e.g. `rabbitmq_shovel` as a dependency of `rabbitmq_shovel_management`),\r\n    CLI tools previously did not discover commands in such plugins. Only explicitly enabled or [pre-configured](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#enabled-plugins-file)\r\n    plugins were scanned for commands.\r\n\r\n    This behavior was confusing. Now all enabled (explicitly or as a dependency) plugins are scanned.\r\n\r\n    Contributed by @SimonUnge (AWS).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6020](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/6020)\r\n\r\n  * `rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown` now returns results much faster in environments with a large number\r\n    of quorum queues (say, tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6390](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6390)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stream Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * Addition of a stream member could fail if the node being added was very early in its boot process\r\n    (and doesn't have a certain stream-related components started).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6182](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6182)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AMQP 1.0 Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n  * Support for \"modified\" disposition outcome used by some client libraries (such as QPid).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6243](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6243)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * Abruptly closed client connections resulted in incorrect updates of certain global\r\n    metric counters.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#5462](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5462)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * Management UI links now include \"noopener\" and \"noreferrer\" attributes to protect\r\n    them against [reverse tabnabbing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing).\r\n    Note that since management UI only includes a small number of external links to trusted resources,\r\n    reverse tabnabbing is unlikely to affect most users. However, it can show up in security scanner results\r\n    and become an issue in environments where a modified version of RabbitMQ is offered as a service.\r\n\r\n    Contributed by @illotum (AWS).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6211](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6211)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * Plugin could stop in environments where no static Shovels were defined and a specific\r\n    sequence of events happens at the same time.\r\n\r\n    Contributed by @gomoripeti (CloudAMQP).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6286](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6286)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n  * Shovel now handles `connection.blocked` and `connection.unblocked` notifications\r\n    from remote destination nodes. This means fewer messages are kept in Shovel buffers when\r\n    a resource alarm goes into affect on the destination node.\r\n\r\n    Contributed by @gomoripeti (CloudAMQP).\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6224](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6224)\r\n\r\n### Windows Installer\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When installation directory was overridden,\r\n   the plugins directory did not respect the updated\r\n   base installation path.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-packaging#29](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-packaging/pull/29)\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * `ra` was upgraded [from `2.3.0` to `2.4.1`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)\r\n * `osiris` was upgraded [from `1.3.1` to `1.3.3`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/tags)\r\n * `seshat` was upgraded [from `0.3.2` to `0.4.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/seshat/tags)\r\n * `credentials_obfuscation` was upgraded [from `3.0.0` to `3.2.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/credentials-obfuscation/releases)\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.11.3.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-09T14:47:30Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.40.1 / 2022-11-09", "tag_name": "v2.40.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.40.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus", "body": "* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix alignment for atomic int64 for 32 bit architecture. #11547\r\n* [BUGFIX] Scrape: Fix accept headers. #11552\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-09T14:17:39Z", "project": "Prometheus", "repo": "prometheus/prometheus", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Kubernetes v1.23.14", "tag_name": "v1.23.14", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.23.14", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes", "body": "\nSee [kubernetes-announce@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce).

Some tracing could have caused a panic (#3599)\r\n    - On stream proposal failures, the server would incorrectly warn about high stream lag. Thanks to @kino71 for the report (#3601)\r\n    - Stream sources with `OptStartTime` would get redelivered messages on server restart. Thanks to @DavidCockerill for the report (#3606)\r\n    - Scaling down a replicated stream (R>1) to R1 while it has no quorum, for instance due to a network partition, would leave the stream in a bad state and there would be a constant report of \"No quorum, stalled\" for this stream, even after the network partition is resolved (#3608)\r\n- LeafNode:\r\n    - Possible duplicate messages in complex setup.

Now queries with sharding should work properly where the query looks like: `foo and without (lbl) bar`.\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n- [#5565](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5565) Receive: Allow remote write request limits to be defined per file and tenant (experimental).\r\n* [#5654](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5654) Query: add `--grpc-compression` flag that controls the compression used in gRPC client. With the flag it is now possible to compress the traffic between Query and StoreAPI nodes - you get lower network usage in exchange for a bit higher CPU/RAM usage.\r\n- [#5650](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5650) Query Frontend: Add sharded queries metrics. `thanos_frontend_sharding_middleware_queries_total` shows how many queries were sharded or not sharded.\r\n- [#5658](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5658) Query Frontend: Introduce new optional parameters (`query-range.min-split-interval`, `query-range.max-split-interval`, `query-range.horizontal-shards`) to implement more dynamic horizontal query splitting.\r\n- [#5721](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5721) Store: Add metric `thanos_bucket_store_empty_postings_total` for number of empty postings when fetching series.\r\n- [#5723](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5723) Compactor: Support disable block viewer UI.\r\n- [#5674](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5674) Query Frontend/Store: Add support connecting to redis using TLS.\r\n- [#5734](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5734) Store: Support disable block viewer UI.\r\n- [#5411](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5411) Tracing: Add OpenTelemetry Protocol exporter.\r\n- [#5779](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5779) Objstore: Support specifying S3 storage class.\r\n- [#5741](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5741) Query: add metrics on how much data is being selected by downstream Store APIs.\r\n- [#5673](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5673) Receive: Reload tenant limit configuration on file change.\r\n- [#5749](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5749) Query Frontend: Added small LRU cache to cache query analysis results.\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n\r\n- [#5738](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5738) Global: replace `crypto/sha256` with `minio/sha256-simd` to make hash calculation faster in metadata and reloader packages.\r\n- [#5648](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5648) Query Frontend: cache vertical shards in query-frontend.\r\n- [#5753](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5753) Build with Go 1.19.\r\n- [#5255](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5296) Query: Use k-way merging for the proxying logic. The proxying sub-system now uses much less resources (~25-80% less CPU usage, ~30-50% less RAM usage according to our benchmarks). Reduces query duration by a few percent on queries with lots of series.\r\n- [#5690](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5690) Compact: update `--debug.accept-malformed-index` flag to apply to downsampling. Previously the flag only applied to compaction, and fatal errors would still occur when downsampling was attempted.\r\n- [#5707](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5707) Objstore: Update objstore to latest version which includes a refactored Azure Storage Account implementation with a new SDK.\r\n- [#5641](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5641) Store: Remove hardcoded labels in shard matcher.\r\n- [#5641](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5641) Query: Inject unshardable le label in query analyzer.\r\n- [#5685](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5685) Receive: Make active/head series limiting configuration per tenant by adding it to new limiting config.\r\n- [#5411](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5411) Tracing: Change Jaeger exporter from OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry. *Options `RPC Metrics`, `Gen128Bit` and `Disabled` are now deprecated and won't have any effect when set :warning:.*\r\n- [#5767](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5767) *: Upgrade Prometheus to v2.39.0.\r\n- [#5771](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5771) *: Upgrade Prometheus to v2.39.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/compare/v0.28.1...v0.29.0", "created_at": "2022-11-03T14:05:49Z", "project": "Thanos", "repo": "thanos-io/thanos", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.20.1", "tag_name": "v0.20.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.20.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/coreos/flannel", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* Update iptables-wrapper-installer.sh from upstream by @endzyme in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1611\r\n* docs: fix troubleshooting by @satoru-takeuchi in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1664\r\n* Added check to ensure the iptables chain by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1669\r\n* don't throw an error when using http to connect to etcd  by @thomasferrandiz in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1667\r\n* Update flannel version to 0.20.1 by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1670\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @endzyme made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1611\r\n* @satoru-takeuchi made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1664\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/compare/v0.20.0...v0.20.1", "created_at": "2022-11-03T09:47:45Z", "project": "Flannel", "repo": "coreos/flannel", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.46.1", "tag_name": "v0.46.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.46.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa", "body": "This is  bugfix release to resolve an issue in the release pipeline. Everything else is\r\nthe same as 0.46.0, which contains a mix of bugfixes, optimizations, and new features:\r\n\r\n### New language feature: refs in rule heads\r\n\r\nWith this version of OPA, we can use a shorthand for defining deeply-nested structures\r\nin Rego:\r\n\r\nBefore, we had to use multiple packages, and hence multiple files to define a structure\r\nlike this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"method\": {\r\n    \"get\": {\r\n      \"allowed\": true\r\n    }\r\n    \"post\": {\r\n      \"allowed\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method.get\r\ndefault allowed := false\r\nallowed { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method.post\r\ndefault allowed := false\r\nallowed { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we can define those rules in single package (and file):\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method\r\nimport future.keywords.if\r\ndefault get.allowed := false\r\nget.allowed if { ... }\r\n\r\ndefault post.allowed := false\r\npost.allowed if { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in this example, the use of the future keyword `if` is mandatory\r\nfor backwards-compatibility: without it, `get.allowed` would be interpreted\r\nas `get[\"allowed\"]`, a definition of a partial set rule.\r\n\r\nCurrently, variables may only appear in the last part of the rule head:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method\r\nimport future.keywords.if\r\n\r\nendpoints[ep].allowed if ep := \"/v1/data\" # invalid\r\nrepos.get.endpoint[x] if x := \"/v1/data\" # valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe valid rule defines this structure:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"method\": {\r\n    \"repos\": {\r\n      \"get\": {\r\n        \"endpoint\": {\r\n          \"/v1/data\": true\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo define a nested key-value pair, we would use\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method\r\nimport future.keywords.if\r\n\r\nrepos.get.endpoint[x] = y if {\r\n  x := \"/v1/data\"\r\n  y := \"example\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMulti-value rules (previously referred to as \"partial set rules\") that are\r\nnested like this need to use `contains` future keyword, to differentiate them\r\nfrom the \"last part is a variable\" case mentioned just above:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage method\r\nimport future.keywords.contains\r\n\r\nrepos.get.endpoint contains x if x := \"/v1/data\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis rule defines the same structure, but with multiple values instead of a key:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"method\": {\r\n    \"repos\": {\r\n      \"get\": {\r\n        \"endpoint\": [\"/v1/data\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo ensure that it's safe to build OPA policies for older OPA versions, a new\r\ncapabilities field was introduced: \"features\". It's a free-form string array:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"features\": [\r\n    \"rule_head_ref_string_prefixes\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this key is not present, the compiler will reject ref-heads. This could be\r\ncase when building bundles for older OPA version using their capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Entrypoint annotations in rule metadata\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to annotate a rule with `entrypoint: true`, and it will\r\nautomatically be picked up by the tooling that expected `--entrypoint` (`-e`)\r\nparameters before.\r\n\r\nFor example, to build this rego policy into a wasm module, you had to pass\r\nan entrypoint:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage test\r\nallow {\r\n    input.x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- `opa build --target wasm --entrypoint test/allow policy.rego`\r\n\r\nWith the annotation:\r\n```rego\r\npackage test\r\n\r\n# METADATA\r\n# entrypoint: true\r\nallow {\r\n    input.x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- `opa build --target wasm policy.rego`\r\n\r\nThe places where entrypoints are taken from metadata are:\r\n\r\n1. Building optimized bundles\r\n2. Building Wasm bundles\r\n3. Building Plan bundles\r\n4. Using optimization with `opa eval`\r\n\r\nKnowing a module's entrypoints can also help in different analysis tasks.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Functon: `graphql.schema_is_valid`\r\n\r\nThe new built-in allows checking schemas:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nschema := `\r\n  extend type User {\r\n      id: ID!\r\n  }\r\n  extend type Product {\r\n      upc: String!\r\n  }\r\n  union _Entity = Product | User\r\n  extend type Query {\r\n    entity: _Entity\r\n  }\r\n`\r\nvalid_schema_example {\r\n    graphql.schema_is_valid(schema)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequested by @olegroom.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Functon: `net.cidr_is_valid`\r\n\r\nThe new built-in function allows checking if a string is a valid CIDR.\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nvalid_cidr_example {\r\n\tnet.cidr_is_valid(\"192.168.0.0/24\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ricardomaraschini.\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK, and Runtime\r\n\r\n- `opa build`: exit with failure on empty signing key ([#4972](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4972)) authored by @Joffref reported by @caldwecr\r\n- `opa exec`: add `--fail` and `--fail-defined` flags ([#5007](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5007)) authored by @byronic reported by @phantlantis\r\n- `opa exec`: convert slashes of explicit bundles (Windows) ([#5134](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5134)) reported by @peterchenadded\r\n- `opa test`: check coverage limit range `[0, 100]` ([#5284](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5284)) authored by @hzliangbin reported by @aholmis\r\n- `opa build`+`opa check`: respect capabilities for parsing, i.e. future keywords ([#5323](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5323)) reported by @TheLunaticScripter\r\n- `opa bench --e2e`: support providing OPA config ([#4899](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4899))\r\n- `opa eval`: new explain mode, `--explain=debug`, that includes unifcations in traces (authored by @jaspervdj)\r\n\r\n- Decision logs: Allow rule-based dropping of decision log entries ([#3945](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3945)) authored by @mariusblarsen and @iamatwork\r\n- Decision Logs: Include the `req_id` attribute in the decision logs ([#5006](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5006)) reported and authored by @humbertoc-silva\r\n- Plugins: export OpenTelemetry TracerProvider for use in plugins (authored by @vinhph0906)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compiler + Topdown\r\n\r\n- `graph.reachable_path`: fix issue with missing subpaths ([#4666](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4666)) authored by @fredallen-wk\r\n- `http.send`: Ensure `force_cache` attribute ignores `Date` header ([#4960](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4960)) reported by @bartandacc\r\n- `with`: Allow replacing functions with rules ([#5299](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5299))\r\n- Evaluation: Skip default functions in full extent ([#5202](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5202)) reported by @ericjkao\r\n- Evaluation: capture more cases of conflicts in function evaluation ([#5272](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5272))\r\n- Rule Indexing: fix incorrect results from indexing `glob.match` even if output is captured ([#5283](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5283))\r\n\r\n- Planner: various correctness fixes: [#5271](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5271), [#5265](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5265), [#5252](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5252)\r\n\r\n- Builtins: Refactor registration functions and signatures (authored by @philipaconrad)\r\n- Compiler: Speed up typechecker when working with Refs (authored by @philipaconrad)\r\n- Trace: add `UnifyOp` to tracer events (authored by @jaspervdj)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Envoy Tutorial: use latest proxy_init (v8)\r\n- Envoy Plugin: Add note about new config param to skip body parsing\r\n- Policy Reference: Add `semver` examples\r\n- Contributing Code: Provide some tips for style fixes\r\n\r\n### Website + Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Website: Make \"outdated version\" banner red if looked-at version is ancient\r\n- Ecosystem: Add CircleCI and Topaz\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Code Cleanup:\r\n  -

"body": "## 1.8.4 (October 28 2022)\n\n### NOTES:\n\n* Packer user documentation has been moved to the new HashiCorp developer\n     documentation portal. The main Packer site (https://www.packer.io) will\n     continue to be the home for Packer but all requests for general\n     documentation and binary downloads will be redirected to\n     https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer. Users are encouraged to visit the\n     developer documentation portal for access to all Packer related\n     documentation; including integrations with HCP Packer.\n\n* The Oracle builder and post-processor are no longer vendored with Packer\n     core. Users of the Oracle plugin should use `packer init` to install the\n     latest version of the plugin. See the [Oracle Plugin\n     Documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-oracle) for more\n     information. [GH-11983](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11983)\n\n* HCP Packer environment variables: The behaviour of some HCP Packer-specific\n     environment variables has changed slightly. Refer to [HCP Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/hcp)\n     in the Packer documentation for a full list of HCP Packer environment variables. [GH-12059](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12059)\n    - For JSON templates, the `HCP_PACKER_REGISTRY` environment variable was\n     previously required to enable the HCP Packer integration. In this release,\n     the environment variable is now optional, and can be used for disabling the\n     publishing of metadata for any HCP Packer enabled configuration template.\n    - For HCL2 templates, the `HCP_PACKER_REGISTRY` environment variable can be used\n     to disable publishing to a HCP Packer registry even if the template defines a\n     `hcp_packer_registry` block. This can be useful for testing that a template\n     works as intended prior to pushing metadata to HCP Packer.\n    - The `HCP_PACKER_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable is now the only\n     requirement to push metadata to a HCP Packer registry, in both JSON \n     and HCL2 templates without a `hcp_packer_registry` block.\n\n### FEATURES:\n\n* provisioner/powershell: Add `use_pwsh` configuration argument to support pwsh\n     in powershell provisioner. [GH-11950](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11950)\n\n### PLUGINS:\n\n* builder/oracle: Remove Oracle plugin from the list of vendored\n     plugins. [GH-11983](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11983)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* command/hcl2_upgrade: Has been updated to persist all possible template\n     engine options that were supported by the legacy JSON templates. While the\n     upgrade command copies the template engine options as is support for the\n     template options may not actually work with HCL2 templates; indicated by an\n     error similar to `fieldname type <no value> is invalid`. Before executing a\n     build with the upgraded template you are encouraged to run `packer validate`\n     against the template and fix any invalid `<no value>` references.\n     [GH-12068](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12068)\n* core/hcl2: Packer will now report an error when executing a build with no\n     sources selected for execution.\n     [GH-12016](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12016)\n* core/hcp: Configuration errors for HCP Packer enabled builds have been\n     consolidated into a single report to help users address all potential\n     issues before retrying their build.\n     [GH-12031](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12031)\n* core/hcp: Named builds within a legacy JSON template are now published to a\n     HCP Packer registry using its full build name (e.g `happycloud.windows-srv-2019)`, \n     as opposed to just the build name field (e.g `\"name\"=\"windows-srv-2019\"`). \n     Builders with no defined name will continue to publish build\n     metadate using the builder type as the build name (e.g `happycloud`).\n     [GH-12059](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12059)\n* core:hcl2: When a variable is set in a variables definitions file (i.e\n     \\*.pkrvars.hcl), but isn't defined with the template files (i.e\n     \\*.pkr.hcl), the outputted error message will now include an example of\n     variable block that can be added to the build template to remedy the issue.\n     [GH-12020](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12020)\n* core: Add ppc64le to binary releases for Linux.\n     [GH-11966](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11966)\n* core: Bump github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2.\n     [GH-11981](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11981)\n* core: Bump supported Go version to 1.18.\n     [GH-11927](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11927)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n* command/hcl2_upgrade: special case: Azure `shared_image_gallery` fix.\n     [GH-12087](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12087)\n* core: Bump golang.org/x/sys to address CVE-2022-29526.\n     [GH-11953](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11953)\n* core: Bump golang.org/x/text to v0.3.8.\n     [GH-12047](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12047)\n* core: Update dependency to resolve GO-2022-0969.\n     [GH-12009](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12009)\n\n", "created_at": "2022-10-28T14:43:05Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.15.0", "tag_name": "v2.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/harness/drone/releases/tag/v2.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/drone/drone", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* Add endpoint for allowing admins to force rotate a user's token by @ShiftedMr in https://github.com/harness/drone/pull/3272\r\n* bump ui version by @d1wilko in https://github.com/harness/drone/pull/3279\r\n* release prep v2.15.0 by @d1wilko in https://github.com/harness/drone/pull/3281\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ShiftedMr made their first contribution in https://github.com/harness/drone/pull/3272\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/harness/drone/compare/v2.14.0...v2.15.0", "created_at": "2022-10-28T09:09:33Z", "project": "Drone", "repo": "drone/drone", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.12.1", "tag_name": "v1.12.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/releases/tag/v1.12.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault", "body": "## 1.12.1\r\n### November 2, 2022\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS:\r\n\r\n* api: Support VAULT_DISABLE_REDIRECTS environment variable (and --disable-redirects flag) to disable default client behavior and prevent the client following any redirection responses.

Please use the `--pprof` flag instead.\r\n- The deprecated `--mem-profile-rate` flag has been removed. Please use `--pprof=mem` instead.\r\n- The deprecated `--mutex-profile-fraction` flag has been removed. Please use `--pprof=mutex` instead.\r\n- The deprecated vtgate/vtexplain/vtcombo flag `--planner_version` has been removed. Please use `--planner-version` instead.\r\n- The deprecated flag `--master_connect_retry` has been removed. Please use `--replication_connect_retry` instead.\r\n- `vtctl` commands that take shard names and ranges as positional arguments (e.g. `vtctl Reshard ks.workflow -80 -40,40-80`) need to have their positional arguments separated from their flag arguments by a double-dash separator to avoid the new parsing library from mistaking them as flags (e.g. `vtctl Reshard ks.workflow -- -80 -40,40-80`).\r\n- The `--cell` flag in the `vtgate` binary no longer has a default value. It is a required argument that has to be specified for the binary to run. Please explicitly specify the flag, if dependent on the flag's default value.\r\n- The `--db-config-*-*` VTTablet flags were deprecated in `v3.0.0`. They have now been deleted as part of this release. You must use `--db_dba_*` now.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-flag-deletions\"/>vttablet Flag Deletions\r\nThe following VTTablet flags were deprecated in 7.0. They have now been deleted\r\n- `--queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-size`\r\n- `--queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-prefill-parallelism`\r\n- `--client-found-rows-pool-size` A different existing flag `--queryserver-config-transaction-cap` will be used instead\r\n- `--transaction_shutdown_grace_period` Use `--shutdown_grace_period` instead\r\n- `--queryserver-config-max-dml-rows`\r\n- `--queryserver-config-allowunsafe-dmls`\r\n- `--pool-name-prefix`\r\n- `--enable-autocommit` Autocommit is always allowed\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vindex-interface\"/>Vindex Interface\r\n\r\nAll the vindex interface methods are changed by adding `context.Context` as an input parameter.\r\n\r\nE.g:\r\n```go\r\nMap(vcursor VCursor, .... ) .... \r\n\tTo\r\nMap(ctx context.Context, vcursor VCursor, .... ) ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only affects users who have added their own custom vindex implementation. \r\nThey are required to change their implementation with these new interface method expectations.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecations\"/>Deprecations\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"logstats-table-and-keyspace-deprecated\"/>LogStats Table and Keyspace deprecated\r\n\r\nInformation about which tables are used was being reported through the `Keyspace` and `Table` fields on LogStats.\r\nFor multi-table queries, this output can be confusing, so we have added `TablesUsed`, that is a string array, listing all tables and which keyspace they are on.\r\n`Keyspace` and `Table` fields are deprecated and will be removed in the v16 release of Vitess.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"orchestrator-integration-deprecation\"/>Orchestrator Integration Deprecation\r\n\r\nOrchestrator integration in `vttablet` has been deprecated. It will continue to work in this release but is liable to be removed in future releases.\r\nConsider using VTOrc instead of Orchestrator as VTOrc goes GA in this release.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"connection-pool-prefill\"/>Connection Pool Prefill\r\n\r\nThe connection pool with prefilled connections have been removed. The pool now does lazy connection creation.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"initshardprimary-deprecation\"/>InitShardPrimary Deprecation\r\n\r\nThe vtcltd command InitShardPrimary has been deprecated. Please use PlannedReparentShard instead.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"command-line-syntax-deprecations\"/>Command-line syntax deprecations\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-startup-flag-deletions\"/>vttablet startup flag deletions\r\nThe following VTTablet flags were deprecated in 7.0. They have now been deleted\r\n- --queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-size\r\n- --queryserver-config-message-conn-pool-prefill-parallelism\r\n- --client-found-rows-pool-size --queryserver-config-transaction-cap will be used instead\r\n- --transaction_shutdown_grace_period Use --shutdown_grace_period instead\r\n- --queryserver-config-max-dml-rows\r\n- --queryserver-config-allowunsafe-dmls\r\n- --pool-name-prefix\r\n- --enable-autocommit Autocommit is always allowed\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-startup-flag-deprecations\"/>vttablet startup flag deprecations\r\n- `--enable-query-plan-field-caching` has been deprecated. It will be removed in v16.\r\n- `--enable_semi_sync` has been deprecated. It will be removed in v16. Instead, set the correct durability policy using `SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy`\r\n- `--queryserver-config-pool-prefill-parallelism`, `--queryserver-config-stream-pool-prefill-parallelism` and `--queryserver-config-transaction-prefill-parallelism` have all been deprecated. They will be removed in v16.\r\n- `--backup_storage_hook` has been deprecated, consider using one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtbackup-flag-deprecations\"/>vtbackup flag deprecations\r\n- `--backup_storage_hook` has been deprecated, consider using one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtgate\"/>VTGate\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgate--mysql-server-pool-conn-read-buffers\"/>vtgate --mysql-server-pool-conn-read-buffers\r\n\r\n`--mysql-server-pool-conn-read-buffers` enables pooling of buffers used to read from incoming\r\nconnections, similar to the way pooling happens for write buffers. Defaults to off.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vdiff2\"/>VDiff v2\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"resume-workflow\"/>Resume Workflow\r\n\r\nWe introduced the ability to resume a VDiff2 workflow:\r\n```\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff --v2 customer.commerce2customer resume 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0\r\nVDiff 4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0 resumed on target shards, use show to view progress\r\n\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff --v2 customer.commerce2customer show last\r\n\r\nVDiff Summary for customer.commerce2customer (4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0)\r\nState:        completed\r\nRowsCompared: 196\r\nHasMismatch:  false\r\nStartedAt:    2022-06-26 22:44:29\r\nCompletedAt:  2022-06-26 22:44:31\r\n\r\nUse \"--format=json\" for more detailed output.\r\n\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff --v2 --format=json customer.commerce2customer show last\r\n{\r\n\t\"Workflow\": \"commerce2customer\",\r\n\t\"Keyspace\": \"customer\",\r\n\t\"State\": \"completed\",\r\n\t\"UUID\": \"4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0\",\r\n\t\"RowsCompared\": 196,\r\n\t\"HasMismatch\": false,\r\n\t\"Shards\": \"0\",\r\n\t\"StartedAt\": \"2022-06-26 22:44:29\",\r\n\t\"CompletedAt\": \"2022-06-26 22:44:31\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe leverage this resume capability to automatically restart a VDiff2 workflow that encountered a retryable error.\r\n\r\nWe also made a number of other enhancements like progress reporting and features needed to make it a full replacement for VDiff v1. You can see more details in the tracking ticket for the VDiff2 feature complete target: https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/10494\r\n\r\nNow that VDiff v2 is feature complete in 15.0, we hope to make it GA in 16.0.\r\n\r\nPlease see the VDiff2 [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/reference/vreplication/vdiff2/) for additional information.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-command-line\"/>New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctl-getschema--table-schema-only\"/>vtctl GetSchema --table-schema-only\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--table-schema-only` skips column introspection. `GetSchema` only returns general schema analysis, and specifically it includes the `CREATE TABLE|VIEW` statement in the `schema` field.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"support-for-additional-compressors-and-decompressors-during-backup-&-restore\"/>Support for additional compressors and decompressors during backup & restore\r\nBackup/Restore now allow you many more options for compression and decompression instead of relying on the default compressor(`pargzip`).\r\nThere are some built-in compressors which you can use out-of-the-box. Users will need to evaluate which option works best for their\r\nuse-case. Here are the flags that control this feature\r\n\r\n- `--compression-engine-name`\r\n- `--external-compressor`\r\n- `--external-decompressor`\r\n- `--external-compressor-extension`\r\n- `--compression-level`\r\n\r\n`--compression-engine-name` specifies the engine used for compression. It can have one of the following values\r\n\r\n- pargzip (Default)\r\n- pgzip\r\n- lz4\r\n- zstd\r\n- external\r\n\r\nIf you want to use any of the built-in compressors, simply set one of the above values other than `external` for `--compression-engine-name`. The value\r\nspecified in `--compression-engine-name` is saved in the backup MANIFEST, which is later read by the restore process to decide which\r\nengine to use for decompression. Default value for engine is 'pargzip'.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use a custom command or external tool for compression/decompression then you need to provide the full command with\r\narguments to the `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` flags. `--external-compressor-extension` flag also needs to be provided\r\nso that compressed files are created with the correct extension. If the external command is not using any of the built-in compression engines\r\n(i.e. pgzip, pargzip, lz4 or zstd) then you need to set `--compression-engine-name` to value 'external'.\r\n\r\nPlease note that if you want to keep the current behavior then you don't need to provide any of these flags.\r\nYou can read more about backup & restore [here] (https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/).\r\n\r\nIf you decided to switch from an external compressor to one of the built-in supported compressors (i.e. pgzip, pargzip, lz4 or zstd) at any point\r\nin the future, you will need to do it in two steps.\r\n\r\n- step #1, set `--external-compressor` and `--external-compressor-extension` flag values to empty and change `--compression-engine-name` to desired value.\r\n- Step #2, after at least one cycle of backup with new configuration, you can set `--external-decompressor` flag value to empty.\r\n\r\nThe reason you cannot change all the values together is because the restore process will then have no way to find out which external decompressor\r\nshould be used to process the previous backup. Please make sure you have thought out all possible scenarios for restore before transitioning from one\r\ncompression engine to another.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"independant-olap-and-oltp-transactional-timeouts\"/>Independent OLAP and OLTP transactional timeouts\r\n\r\n`--queryserver-config-olap-transaction-timeout` specifies the timeout applied\r\nto a transaction created within an OLAP workload. The default value is `30`\r\nseconds, but this can be raised, lowered, or set to zero to disable the timeout\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nUntil now, while OLAP queries would bypass the query timeout, transactions\r\ncreated within an OLAP session would be rolled back\r\n`--queryserver-config-transaction-timeout` seconds after the transaction was\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nAs of now, OLTP and OLAP transaction timeouts can be configured independently of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe main use case is to run queries spanning a long period of time which\r\nrequire transactional guarantees such as consistency or atomicity.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"support-for-specifying-group-information-in-calls-to-vtgate\"/>Support for specifying group information in calls to VTGate\r\n\r\n`--grpc-use-effective-groups` allows non-SSL callers to specify groups information for a caller.\r\nUntil now, you could only specify the caller-id for the security context used to authorize queries.\r\nAs of now, you can specify the principal of the caller, and any groups they belong to.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"online-ddl-changes\"/>Online DDL changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"concurrent-vitess-migrations\"/>Concurrent vitess migrations\r\n\r\nAll Online DDL migrations using the `vitess` strategy are now eligible to run concurrently, given `--allow-concurrent` DDL strategy flag. Until now, only `CREATE`, `DROP` and `REVERT` migrations were eligible, and now `ALTER` migrations are supported, as well. The terms for `ALTER` migrations concurrency:\r\n\r\n- DDL strategy must be `vitess --allow-concurent ...`\r\n- No two migrations can run concurrently on the same table\r\n- No two `ALTER`s will copy table data concurrently\r\n- A concurrent `ALTER` migration will not start if another `ALTER` is running and is not `ready_to_complete`\r\n\r\nThe main use case is to run multiple concurrent migrations, all with `--postpone-completion`. All table-copy operations will run sequentially, but no migration will actually cut-over, and eventually all migrations will be `ready_to_complete`, continuously tailing the binary logs and keeping up-to-date. A quick and iterative `ALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '...' COMPLETE` sequence of commands will cut-over all migrations _closely together_ (though not atomically together).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctl-command-changes\"/>vtctl command changes. \r\nAll `online DDL show` commands can now be run with a few additional parameters\r\n- `--order` , order migrations in the output by either ascending or descending order of their `id` fields.\r\n- `--skip`  , skip specified number of migrations in the output.\r\n- `--limit` , limit results to a specified number of migrations in the output.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"new-syntax\"/>New syntax\r\n\r\nThe following is now supported:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION COMPLETE ALL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works on all pending migrations (`queued`, `ready`, `running`) and internally issues a `ALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '<uuid>' COMPLETE` for each one. The command is useful for completing multiple concurrent migrations (see above) that are open-ended (`--postpone-completion`).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet Throttler\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"api-changes\"/>API changes\r\n\r\nAPI endpoint `/debug/vars` now exposes throttler metrics, such as number of hits and errors per app per check type. Example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:15100/debug/vars | jq . | grep Throttler\r\n  \"ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlSelf\": 0.191718,\r\n  \"ThrottlerAggregatedMysqlShard\": 0.960054,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyError\": 27,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfError\": 13,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlSelfTotal\": 38,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardError\": 14,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyMysqlShardTotal\": 42,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckAnyTotal\": 80,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckMysqlSelfSecondsSinceHealthy\": 0,\r\n  \"ThrottlerCheckMysqlShardSecondsSinceHealthy\": 0,\r\n  \"ThrottlerProbesLatency\": 355523,\r\n  \"ThrottlerProbesTotal\": 74,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"mysql-compatibility\"/>Mysql Compatibility\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"system-settings\"/>System Settings\r\nVitess has had support for system settings from release 7.0 onwards, but this support came with some caveats.\r\nAs soon as a client session changes a default system setting, a mysql connection gets reserved for it.\r\nThis can sometimes lead to clients running out of mysql connections. \r\nUsers were instructed to minimize the use of this feature and to try to set the desired system settings as defaults in the mysql config.\r\n\r\nWith this release, Vitess can handle system settings changes in a much better way and clients can use them more freely.\r\nVitess now has the ability to pool changed settings without reserving connections for any particular session. \r\n\r\nThis feature can be enabled by setting `queryserver-enable-settings-pool` flag on the vttablet. It is disabled by default.\r\nIn future releases, we will make this flag enabled by default.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"lookup-vindexes\"/>Lookup Vindexes\r\n\r\nLookup vindexes now support a new parameter `multi_shard_autocommit`. If this is set to `true`, lookup vindex dml queries will be sent as autocommit to all shards instead of being wrapped in a transaction.\r\nThis is different from the existing `autocommit` parameter where the query is sent in its own transaction separate from the ongoing transaction if any i.e. begin -> lookup query execs -> commit/rollback\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"durability-policy\"/>Durability Policy\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"cross-cell\"/>Cross Cell\r\n\r\nA new durability policy `cross_cell` is now supported. `cross_cell` durability policy only allows replica tablets from a different cell than the current primary to\r\nsend semi-sync ACKs. This ensures that any committed write exists in at least 2 tablets belonging to different cells.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-explain-format\"/>New EXPLAIN format\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"format=vtexplain\"/>FORMAT=vtexplain\r\n\r\nWith this new `explain` format, you can get an output that is very similar to the command line `vtexplain` app, but from a running `vtgate`, through a MySQL query.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtorc\"/>VTOrc\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"old-ui-removal-and-replacement\"/>Old UI Removal and Replacement\r\n\r\nThe old UI that VTOrc inherited from `Orchestrator` has been removed. A replacement UI, more consistent with the other Vitess binaries has been created.\r\nIn order to use the new UI, `--port` flag has to be provided. \r\n\r\nAlong with the UI, the old APIs have also been deprecated. However, some of them have been ported over to the new UI - \r\n\r\n| Old API                          | New API                          | Additional notes                                                      |\r\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `/api/problems`                  | `/api/problems`                  | The new API also supports filtering using the keyspace and shard name |\r\n| `/api/disable-global-recoveries` | `/api/disable-global-recoveries` | Functionally remains the same                                         |\r\n| `/api/enable-global-recoveries`  | `/api/enable-global-recoveries`  | Functionally remains the same                                         |\r\n| `/api/health`                    | `/debug/health`                  | Functionally remains the same                                         |\r\n| `/api/replication-analysis`      | `/api/replication-analysis`      | Functionally remains the same. Output is now JSON format.             |\r\n\r\nApart from these APIs, we also now have `/debug/status`, `/debug/vars` and `/debug/liveness` available in the new UI.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"configuratoin-refactor-and-new-flags\"/>Configuration Refactor and New Flags \r\n\r\nSince VTOrc was forked from `Orchestrator`, it inherited a lot of configurations that don't make sense for the Vitess use-case.\r\nAll of such configurations have been removed.\r\n\r\nVTOrc ignores the configurations that it doesn't understand. So old configurations can be kept around on upgrading and won't cause any issues.\r\nThey will just be ignored.\r\n\r\nFor all the configurations that are kept, flags have been added for them and the flags are the desired way to pass these configurations going forward.\r\nThe config file will be deprecated and removed in upcoming releases. The following is a list of all the configurations that are kept and the associated flags added.\r\n\r\n|          Configurations Kept          |           Flags Introduced            |\r\n|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|\r\n|            SQLite3DataFile            |         `--sqlite-data-file`          |\r\n|          InstancePollSeconds          |        `--instance-poll-time`         |\r\n|    SnapshotTopologiesIntervalHours    |    `--snapshot-topology-interval`     |\r\n|    ReasonableReplicationLagSeconds    |    `--reasonable-replication-lag`     |\r\n|             AuditLogFile              |        `--audit-file-location`        |\r\n|             AuditToSyslog             |         `--audit-to-backend`          |\r\n|           AuditToBackendDB            |          `--audit-to-syslog`          |\r\n|            AuditPurgeDays             |       `--audit-purge-duration`        |\r\n|      RecoveryPeriodBlockSeconds       |  `--recovery-period-block-duration`   |\r\n| PreventCrossDataCenterPrimaryFailover |    `--prevent-cross-cell-failover`    |\r\n|        LockShardTimeoutSeconds        |        `--lock-shard-timeout`         |\r\n|      WaitReplicasTimeoutSeconds       |       `--wait-replicas-timeout`       |\r\n|     TopoInformationRefreshSeconds     | `--topo-information-refresh-duration` |\r\n|          RecoveryPollSeconds          |      `--recovery-poll-duration`       |\r\n\r\nApart from configurations, some flags from VTOrc have also been removed -\r\n- `sibling`\r\n- `destination`\r\n- `discovery`\r\n- `skip-unresolve`\r\n- `skip-unresolve-check`\r\n- `noop`\r\n- `binlog`\r\n- `statement`\r\n- `grab-election`\r\n- `promotion-rule`\r\n- `skip-continuous-registration`\r\n- `enable-database-update`\r\n- `ignore-raft-setup`\r\n- `tag`\r\n\r\nThe ideal way to ensure backward compatibility is to remove the flags listed above while on the previous release. Then upgrade VTOrc.\r\nAfter upgrading, remove the config file and instead pass the flags that are introduced.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"example-upgrade\"/>Example Upgrade\r\n\r\nIf you are running VTOrc with the flags `--ignore-raft-setup --clusters_to_watch=\"ks/0\" --config=\"path/to/config\"` and the following configuration\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"Debug\": true,\r\n  \"ListenAddress\": \":6922\",\r\n  \"MySQLTopologyUser\": \"orc_client_user\",\r\n  \"MySQLTopologyPassword\": \"orc_client_user_password\",\r\n  \"MySQLReplicaUser\": \"vt_repl\",\r\n  \"MySQLReplicaPassword\": \"\",\r\n  \"RecoveryPeriodBlockSeconds\": 1,\r\n  \"InstancePollSeconds\": 1,\r\n  \"PreventCrossDataCenterPrimaryFailover\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFirst drop the flag `--ignore-raft-setup` while on the previous release. So, you'll be running VTOrc with `--clusters_to_watch=\"ks/0\" --config=\"path/to/config\"` and the same configuration listed above.\r\n\r\nNow you can upgrade your VTOrc version continuing to use the same flags and configurations, and it will continue to work just the same. If you wish to use the new UI, then you can add the `--port` flag as well.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading, you can drop the configuration entirely and use the new flags like `--clusters_to_watch=\"ks/0\" --recovery-period-block-duration=1s --instance-poll-time=1s --prevent-cross-cell-failover`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"default-configuration-files\"/>Default Configuration Files\r\n\r\nThe default files that VTOrc searches for configurations in have also changed from `\"/etc/orchestrator.conf.json\", \"conf/orchestrator.conf.json\", \"orchestrator.conf.json\"` to\r\n`\"/etc/vtorc.conf.json\", \"conf/vtorc.conf.json\", \"vtorc.conf.json\"`.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"flags-restructure\"/>Flags Restructure\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"flags-diff\"/>Flags Diff\r\n\r\nIn addition to these major streams of work in release-15.0, we have made tremendous progress on [VEP-4, aka The Flag Situation](https://github.com/vitessio/enhancements/blob/main/veps/vep-4.md), reorganizing our code so that Vitess binaries and their flags are\r\nclearly aligned in help text. An immediate win for usability, this positions us well to move on to a [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) implementation which will facilitate additional improvements including standardization of flag syntax and runtime configuration reloads.\r\nWe are also aligning with industry standards regarding the use of flags, ensuring a seamless experience for users migrating from or integrating with other platforms.\r\nBelow are the changes for each binary.\r\n- [mysqlctl](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/release-15.0/doc/flags/14.0-to-15.0-transition/mysqlctl.diff)\r\n-

This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#6303](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6303), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - Fix CVE-2022-27652 by dropping and refusing to add any inheritable capabilities ([#5770](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5770), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information. ([#5937](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5937), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where child processes of containers in the host's PID namespace appear to leak after the child exits ([#5977](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5977), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a panic caused by using the improper Result structure version when setting up CNI plugins ([#6320](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6320), [@juanfresia](https://github.com/juanfresia))\r\n - Revert fix for CVE-2022-27652 by re-adding inheritable capabilities. While there is a workaround, we believe this causes regression mid cycle with is contrary to CRI-O's backporting policy. The risk of the CVE is low, and so there is little risk in reverting here. ([#6168](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6168), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Update `cni_default_network` to not be commented by default in the output of `crio config` ([#5566](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5566), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Uncategorized\r\n - Fix a bug where a container is stuck in INIT because CRI-O believes it to be paused, and never updates the state ([#6143](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6143), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#6171](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6171), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a rare deadlock while communicating to systemd (RHBZ 2082344) ([#5961](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5961), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Use default umask `0o022` if CRI-O runs under a different umask value.

(#4622, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- There are so many EnsureXDeleted in the sub-packages of objects , so unify them to objects/EnsureObjectDelete (#4630, @izturn)\r\n- Transition to using new bootstrap field `default_regex_engine` instead of deprecated per-regex match engine selection. (#4652, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway Listeners with Secret references whose namespace is not covered by a ReferenceGrant should have their status reason set to RefNotPermitted. (#4664, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Add a new flag `leader-election-namespace` for gateway-provisioner (#4669, @izturn)\r\n- Add Contour log level configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4676, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes client debug log level configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4677, @izturn)\r\n- add the fields extraVolumes & extraVolumeMounts to crd/ContourDeployment to enable Envoy pods to mount additional volumes (#4680, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes annotations configurability to ContourDeployment resource. to enable customize pod annotations for pod/envoy (#4681, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes resource labels configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4709, @izturn)\r\n- Add resource requirements configurability to ContourDeployment to enable resource quota for containers. (#4712, @izturn)\r\n- Gateway API: status-only updates to resources no longer trigger DAG reprocessing and xDS updates. (#4744, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: don't make status update calls to the API server if status has not changed on the resource. (#4745, @skriss)\r\n- Updates to Gateway API v0.5.1. (#4755, @skriss)\r\n- Update supported Kubernetes versions to 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25. (#4757, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- For Gateway API conformance, when a HTTP request matches multiple rules within a HTTPRoute, precedence is given to the rule that comes first in that HTTPRoute (in list-order). (#4763, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates Go to 1.19.2, see [release notes here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.minor). (#4773, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Update Envoy to v1.24.0. See the [Envoy release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.24.0/version_history/v1.24/v1.24.0) for more information. (#4804, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Added guide for configuring gRPC routes. (#4725, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n## Contour v1.20 minor release now out of support\r\n\r\nAs per [Contour's support policy](https://projectcontour.io/resources/support/) the v1.20 minor release will now no longer be patched for security or critical bug fixes.\r\nPlease upgrade to the v1.21 minor release or newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.23.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.23 through 1.25.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better! For this release, special thanks go out to the following contributors:\r\n\r\n- @izturn\r\n\r\n\r\n# Are you a Contour user?

As routes using the cluster domain suffix are not exposed through Ingress, users will need to [configure DNS](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#configure-dns) in order to expose their services (most users probably already are). (#13259, @psschwei)\r\n- Upgrade HorizontalPodAutoscaler to autoscaling/v2 API version (#13337, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Services may now set `seccompProfile` in SecurityContext to allow users to comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standards best-practice (#13401, @evankanderson)\r\n- Bump min-version to k8s 1.23, so removing kind 1.22 testing (#13357, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Increase the outbound context deadline in reconcilers to 30s (from 10s) to match the maximum K8s webhook timeout. (#13323, @mattmoor)\r\n \r\n## \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n- Add timeout handling in Activator  when processing a request for a revision (#13261, @nader-ziada)\r\n- EmptyDir volumes feature flag is now enabled by default (#13405, @dprotaso)\r\n- Queue proxy explicit set `SeccompProfile` to `RunTimeDefault` to be able to run under restricted PSP policy by default. (#13376, @skonto)\r\n- Save data from perf tests to create a dashboard. (#13192, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\n### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Knative services can now specify securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation (#13395, @mattmoor)\r\n- ConfigMap config-defaults property `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` now defaults to `revision-timeout-seconds`. This should unblock upgrades who set `revision-timeout-seconds` lower than the default value of 300 (#13255, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix LatestReadyRevision semantics so it only advances forward. When a Revision fails the Configuration & Route will no longer fall back to older revision. The exception is when you rollback to a Revision that is explicitly named.

This has the effect of causing rollbacks from Rancher v2.6.4 to any previous version of Rancher v2.6.x to fail because the previous version the CRDs needed to roll back are no longer available in v1beta1. To avoid this, the Rancher resource cleanup script should be run **before** the restore or rollback is attempted. This script can be found in the [rancherlabs/support-tools repo](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/rancher-cleanup) and the usage of the script can be found in [the backup-restore operator docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/). In addition, when users roll back Rancher on the same cluster using the Rancher Backup and Restore app in 2.6.4+, the [updated steps to create the Restore Custom Resource](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/#create-the-restore-custom-resource) must be followed. See also [#36803](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36803) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue which caused version 1.0.0 of the CSP Adapter to incorrectly count nodes. Users should only use version 1.0.1 or higher of the adapter to ensure that node counts are accurate. See [#38712](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38712).\r\n- Fixed an issue where role templates with circular references (e.g., role template 1 inherits role template 2 which inherits role template 1) could result in high CPU usage and crashes. Requests to create new role templates with such a structure (or edit existing role templates to have such a structure) should not fail, and Rancher should no longer have excessively high CPU cycles when attempting to process such existing roles. Note that this will not remove existing custom roles which have circular references; therefore, it is recommended that users review existing role templates to ensure that they do not have circular references (such role templates will not function as desired). See [#38419](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38419).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which user attributes were not being refreshed correctly and sometimes became empty which caused impersonation rules to be incorrect. See [#36096](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36096).\r\n- Fixed an issue where user-defined EKS security groups were configured as the only node group security groups rather than being appended to the cluster default security group. See [#38014](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38014).\r\n- Fixed issue in which OPA Gatekeeper became stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n- Users running RHEL/CentOS 7 may install or upgrade using K3s/RKE2 v1.24.4 and up. See [#5912](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/5912).\r\n- RKE v1.3.10-v1.3.13 in Rancher v2.6.7-v2.6.8 no longer removes user addons during an upgrade before redeploying them, which would cause issues with RKE1 cluster upgrades if user addons template has `cattle-*` or other system namespaces. See [#38876](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38876).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which after installing any chart through the Rancher UI, the `proxy` container of the `helm-operation` pod was not terminated, and it would become `NotReady`. See [#38873](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38873).\r\n- Resolved an issue in which Kubernetes API events were not recorded when the log level was set to 3. See [#38323](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38323).\r\n- Admins can now reconfigure (edit) a new Azure AD setup as well as a setup with updated endpoints for the Microsoft Graph without errors. See [#38753](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38753).\r\n- A bug has been fixed that resulted in certain clusters being rendered unavailable after upgrade. This was due to improper migration of certain cluster fields to secrets. The known cluster types this affected were legacy AKS, GKE, and EKS clusters but may have affected other types of clusters as well. See [#38699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38699).\r\n- RKE2 and K3s custom clusters now provision as expected when using a proxy. See [#39068](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39068).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which the Rancher UI produced the wrong CLI command when joining a node to a cluster with a taint in AWS. See [#6827](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6827).\r\n- In the Rancher UI, yellow icons have been added to indicate which clusters need to be updated. See [#6580](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6580).\r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- For Azure AD, Rancher now doesn't create or update the cached secret with the Azure AD access token if a new token does not have the necessary permissions. Rancher also prevents admins from updating the endpoints for Microsoft Graph if a new token lacks permissions. Note that this will be removed in v2.6.10 in favor of a different approach of handling token permissions. See [#38754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38754).\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n### Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- Upon upgrade to Rancher v2.6.8, the UI consistently throws `Websocket Disconnected` errors. Note that alerts have been hidden behind a toggle by default so that systems remain usable. See [#6960](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6960).\r\n- When navigating to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Management page or Home page, the namespace filter is missing from the top-right corner. As a workaround, navigate to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Explorer page to have access to the namespace filter. See [#7213](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7213).\r\n- Kubernetes versions 1.24.x are incorrectly marked as \u201cexperimental\u201d when provisioning AKS clusters (1.24.x versions are fully supported for AKS clusters). See [#7217](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7217).\r\n\r\n### Harvester\r\n\r\n- When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n\r\n### K3s\r\n\r\n- The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. This will be fixed in an upcoming release. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n\r\n### RKE \r\n\r\n- High CPU usage is observed on RKE1 v1.24.x clusters. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816]( https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Cert-Manager:**\r\n  - Rancher now supports cert-manager versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1. We recommend v1.7.x because v 1.6.x will reach end-of-life on March 30, 2022. To read more, see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#4-install-cert-manager).\r\n  - When upgrading Rancher and cert-manager, you will need to use [Option B: Reinstalling Rancher and cert-manager](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/upgrades/#option-b-reinstalling-rancher-and-cert-manager) from the Rancher docs.\r\n  - There are several versions of cert-manager which, due to their backwards incompatibility, are not recommended for use with Rancher. You can read more about which versions are affected by this issue in the [cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/). As a result, only versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1 are recommended for use at this time.\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.5 to 1.6, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.5-1.6/).\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.6 to 1.7, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.6-1.7/).\r\n- **Readiness and Liveness Check:**\r\n  - Users can now configure the `Readiness Check` and `Liveness Check` of `coredns-autoscaler`. See [#24939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24939).\r\n- **Legacy Features:**\r\n  - Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n  - When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.  See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).\r\n- **Library and Helm3-Library Catalogs:**\r\n  - Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.\r\n- **Local Cluster:**\r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Upgrading the Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and Saving Clusters:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **EKS Cluster:**\r\n  - There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System Components:**\r\n  - Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **GKE and AKS Clusters:**\r\n  - Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **Rolling Back Rancher:**\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC:**\r\n  - Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **Azure Cloud Provider for RKE2:**\r\n  - For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs. Kube Nodes:**\r\n  - In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Rancher's External IP Webhook:**\r\n  - In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Snapshot\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.9\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.6.9](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.9)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.15](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.15)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.10\r\n- v1.22.13\r\n- v1.21.14\r\n- v1.20.15\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nFeature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tUsed to enable the ability to provision RKE2 clusters. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Rancher Features\r\n\r\n- RancherD was introduced as part of Rancher v2.5.4 through v2.5.10 as an experimental feature but is now deprecated. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/authentication/azure-ad/#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\nThe following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring v1\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster gets stuck in provisioning state after an upgrade to v2.6.4 and rollback to v2.6.3. See [#36859](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36859).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster has its nodes redeployed when upgrading Rancher from v2.6.3 to v2.6.4. See [#36627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36627).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/faq/networking/cni-providers/#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - In v2.6.5, v1.21.x of RKE2 will remain experimental and [unsupported](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) for RKE2 Windows. End users should not use v1.21.x of RKE2 for any RKE2 cluster that will have Windows worker nodes. This is due to an [upstream Calico bug](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) that was not backported to the minor version of Calico (3.19.x) that is present in v1.21.x of RKE2. See [#131](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131).\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **AWS:**\r\n    - On RHEL8.4 SELinux in AWS AMI, Kubernetes v1.22 fails to provision on AWS. As Rancher will not install RPMs on the nodes, users may work around this issue either by using AMI with this package already installed, or by installing AMI via cloud-init. Users will encounter this issue on upgrade to v1.22 as well. When upgrading to 1.22, users must manually upgrade/install the rancher-selinux package on all the nodes in the cluster, then upgrade the Kubernetes version. See [#36509](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36509).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n  - **Oracle:**\r\n    - Kubernetes 1.24 clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4. See [#38214](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38214).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n    - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).\r\n    - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2022-10-14T22:32:43Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github",

"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary", "body": "## 0.11.0 (2022/09/27)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* PKI workers in past versions did not store a prior encryption key, and a bug\n  prior to 0.11.0 meant that auth rotations could happen more frequently than\n  expected. This could cause some race issues around rotation time. However,\n  there was another issue where a past worker authentication record could be\n  looked up for some operations instead of the current one, made more likely by\n  the too-frequent rotations. In 0.11.0 we attempt to ensure that the record\n  that remains on upgrade is the most current one, but it is possible that the\n  wrong one is chosen, leading to a failure for the worker to authenticate or\n  for some operations to consistently fail. In this case, the worker will need\n  to be deleted and re-authorized. We apologize for any issues this causes and\n  this should be remedied going forward.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix bug preventing delete of org. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465)\n* scopes: Organizations could be prevented from being deleted if some resources\n    remained ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465))\n* workers: Authentication rotation could occur prior to the expected time\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2484))\n* workers: When looking up worker authentication records, an old record could be\n  returned instead of the new one, leading to errors for encryption or\n  decryption operations ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* vault: (HCP Boundary only): Private Vault clusters can be used with HCP Boundary by using PKI workers\n  deployed in the same network as a private cluster. Tags are used to control which PKI workers can manage private Vault\n  requests by specifying a `worker_filter` attribute when configuring a Vault credential store.\n* credentials: There is now a `json` credential type supported by `static`\n  credential stores that allows submitting a generic JSON object to Boundary for\n  use with credential brokering workflows\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2423))\n* ui: Add support for worker management\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1229))\n* ui: Add support for PKI worker registration\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1244))\n* ui: Add support for Static Credential Stores\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1193))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Password Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1205))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Key Pair Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1266))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): SSH Target creation along with injected application\n  credential support ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1027))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): Update vault credential stores to support private\n  vault access ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1318))\n* ui: Improve quick setup wizard onboarding guide resource names\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1328))\n* ui: Updates to host catalog and host set forms and \u201cLearn More\u201d links\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1342))\n* workers: Added the ability to read and reinitialize the Worker certificate\n  authority ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2312),\n  [PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2387))\n* workers: Return the worker Boundary binary version on worker list and read\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2377))\n* workers: Addition of worker graceful shutdown, triggered by an initial\n  `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2455))\n* workers: Retain one previous encryption/decryption key after authentication\n  rotation ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In 0.5.0, the `add-host-sets`, `remove-host-sets`, and `set-host-sets` actions\n  on targets were deprecated in favor of `add-host-sources`,\n  `remove-host-sources`, and `set-host-sources`. Originally these actions and\n  API calls were to be removed in 0.6, but this was delayed to give extra time\n  for clients to switch over. This has now been fully switched over. A database\n  migration will modify any grants in roles to have the new actions. This same\n  changeover has been made for `add-/remove-/set-credential-libraries` to\n  `add-/remove-/set-credential-sources`, although those actions would only be in\n  grant strings in very rare circumstances as the `-sources` actions replaced\n  the `-libraries` actions very quickly.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2393))\n\n", "created_at": "2022-09-27T13:35:44Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.20.0", "tag_name": "v2.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/releases/tag/v2.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray", "body": "### Deprecation / Removal\r\n- Drop Ansible support for v2.9 and v2.10 (#8925, @oomichi)\r\n- Drop support for Fedora 34 (#8967, @floryut)\r\n\r\n### Feature / Major changes\r\n\r\n- Add Rocky Linux 8 support (#8905, @oomichi)\r\n- Add Kylin Linux support.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.

This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- A container runtime such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/) must be available to execute builds.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nFor instructions on installing `pack`, see our [installation docs](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/cli/install/).\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nCLI for building apps using Cloud Native Buildpacks\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build

v0.14.1](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.1) by default.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Update error when bp order group is malformed for meta-buildpacks (#1437 by @imnitishng)\r\n* When pack is run with --verbose, it should not print registry creds (#1433 by @natalieparellano)\r\n* When platform api >= 0.9, analyzer accepts -skip-layers and -launch-cache (#1417 by @natalieparellano)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* Running `pack build` with a builder using [lifecycle 0.14.0](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.0) yields an error [\"ERROR: failed to create launch cache\"](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1467).\r\n    * Cause: https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/pull/847\r\n    * Resolutions:\r\n        * **Option 1:** Use a builder with `lifecycle` >= [0.14.1](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.1).\r\n           `pack builder inspect <builder-image>` can be used to inspect a builder image.\r\n        * **Option 2:** Use `--lifecycle-image=buildpacksio/lifecycle:0.14.1 --trust-builder=false` flags with `pack build`.\r\n            These flags would make pack use the patched version of the lifecycle for the `analyze`, `restore` and `export` phases.\r\n            [Learn more](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/concepts/trusted_builders/).\r\n\r\n##
