Previously, if `allowed_connection_types` was specified and contained `LEAFNODE`, this user could be used to create a Leafnode connection over websocket. The existing `WEBSOCKET` connection type is used for regular client applications (#2707)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Slowness with large interior deletes (#2711)\r\n    - Possible panic when removing a source from a stream. Thanks to @kylebernhardy for the report (#2712)\r\n    - Reject invalid subjects in stream configuration, and attempt to fix them on recovery (#2717, #2721)\r\n    - Prevent stream update to add subjects to mirror and remove them on recovery (#2718, #2721)\r\n    - Application may receive corrupted headers when receiving from a consumer configured with \"MetaOnly\" option (#2719)\r\n    - Aligned internal timeout to 4 seconds for stream and consumer list requests (#2722)\r\n    - Incomplete error when consumer list in cluster mode failed (#2725)\r\n- Leafnode:\r\n    - When using `allowed_connection_types`, it was not possible to restrict a Leafnode connection over websocket (#2707)\r\n    - Reaching the account connections limit left an outgoing Leafnode connection in a bad state (#2715)\r\n- Monitoring:\r\n    - TLS configuration changes would not take effect after a configuration reload (#2714)\r\n- Documentation:\r\n    - Links in the README.

See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1892).\r\n* FEATURE: add `now()` function to MetricsQL. This function returns the current timestamp in seconds. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#now).\r\n* FEATURE: vmauth: allow using optional `name` field in configs. This field is then used as `username` label value for `vmauth_user_requests_total` metric. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1805).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: export `vm_persistentqueue_read_duration_seconds_total` and `vm_persistentqueue_write_duration_seconds_total` metrics, which can be used for detecting persistent queue saturation with `rate(vm_persistentqueue_write_duration_seconds_total) > 0.9` alerting rule.\r\n* FEATURE: export `vm_filestream_read_duration_seconds_total` and `vm_filestream_write_duration_seconds_total` metrics, which can be used for detecting persistent disk saturation with `rate(vm_filestream_read_duration_seconds_total) > 0.9` alerting rule.\r\n* FEATURE: export `vm_cache_size_max_bytes` metrics, which show capacity for various caches. These metrics can be used for determining when caches reach its capacity with `vm_cache_size_bytes / vm_cache_size_max_bytes > 0.9` query.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html), [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html): add `-s3ForcePathStyle` command-line flag, which can be used for making backups to [Aliyun OSS](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1802).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): improve data migration from OpenTSDB. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1809). Thanks to @johnseekins .\r\n* FEATURE: suppress `connection reset by peer` errors when remote client resets TCP connection to VictoriaMetrics / vmagent while ingesting the data via InfluxDB line protocol, Graphite protocol or OpenTSDB protocol. This error is expected, so there is no need in logging it.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): store the display type in URL, so it isn't lost when copy-pasting the URL. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1804).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: make `-notifier.url` command-line flag optional. This flag can be omitted if `vmalert` is used solely for recording rules and doesn't evaluate alerting rules. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1870).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html), [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html): export internal metrics at `http://vmbackup:8420/metrics` and `http://vmrestore:8421/metrics` for better visibility of the backup/restore process.\r\n* FEATURE: allow trailing whitespace after the timestamp when [parsing Graphite plaintext lines](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-graphite-compatible-agents-such-as-statsd). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1865).\r\n* FEATURE: expose `/-/healthy` and `/-/ready` endpoints as Prometheus does. This is needed for improving integration with third-party solutions, which rely on these endpoints. See [tis issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1833).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: prevent from scraping duplicate targets if `-promscrape.dropOriginalLabels` command-line flag is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1830). Thanks to @guidao for the fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmstorage [enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html): added missing `vm_tenant_used_tenant_bytes` metric, which shows the approximate per-tenant disk usage. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/PerTenantStatistic.html) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1605).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmauth: properly take into account the value passed to `-maxIdleConnsPerBackend` command-line flag. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1300).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: fix [reading data from Kafka](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#reading-metrics-from-kafka).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: fix [replay mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#rules-backfilling) in enterprise version.\r\n* BUGFIX: consistently return zero from [deriv()](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#deriv) function applied to a constant time series. Previously it could return small non-zero values in this case.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html): properly resume downloading for partially downloaded big files. Previously such files were re-downloaded from the beginning after the interrupt. Now only the remaining parts of the file are downloaded. This allows saving network bandwidth.

With this optimization, the evaluator stops evaluating rules when an answer has been found and subsequent evaluation would not yield any new answers. The optimization is automatically applied to complete rules and functions that meet specific requirements. For more information see the [Early Exit in Rule Evaluation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-performance/#early-exit-in-rule-evaluation) section in the docs. [#2092](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2092)\r\n\r\n### Built-in Functions\r\n\r\n- The `net.lookup_ip_addr` function was added to allow policies to resolve hostnames to IPv4/IPv6 addresses ([#3993](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3993))\r\n- The `http.send` function has been improved to close TCP connections quickly after receiving the HTTP response and avoid creating HTTP clients unnecessarily when a cached response exists ([#4015](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4015)). This change reduces the number of open file descriptors required in high-throughput environments and prevents OPA from encountering ulimit errors.\r\n\r\n### Rego\r\n\r\n- `print()` calls in the head of rules no longer cause runtime errors ([#3967](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3967))\r\n- Type errors for calls to undefined functions no longer contain rewritten variable names ([#4031](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4031))\r\n- The `rego.SkipPartialNamespace` option now correctly sets the flag on the partial evaluation queries (previously it would always set the value to `true`) ([#3996](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3996)) authored by @[thomascoquet](https://github.com/thomascoquet)\r\n- The internal set implementation has been updated to insert elements in sorted order rather than lazily sorting during comparisons.\r\n- Fixed `import` alias parsing bug identified by fuzzer ([#3988](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3988))\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\n- The Golang SDK will now issue a `grow()` call if the `input` document exceeds the available memory space.\r\n- The `malloc()` implementation will now call `opa_abort` if the `grow()` call fails.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n- The decision logger adapts upload chunk sizes based on previous outputs. This allows the decision loggger to encode significantly more decisions into each upload chunk, thereby reducing heap usage for buffered decisions. For more information on the adapative chunking behaviour, see the [Decision Logs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-decision-logs/) page in the docs.\r\n- The decision logger can be configured to send records to a custom plugin as well as an HTTP endpoint at the same time ([#4013](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4013))\r\n- `print()` calls from the `system.authz` policy are now included in the logs ([#4048](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4048))\r\n- OPA can use an [Azure Managed Identities Token](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/#azure-managed-identities-token) to authenticate with control plane services ([#3916](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3916)) authored by @[Scowluga](https://github.com/Scowluga).\r\n- The logging configuration will be correctly applied to service clients so that DEBUG logs are surfaced ([#4071](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4071))\r\n\r\n### Tooling\r\n\r\n- The `opa fmt` command will not generate a line-break when there are generated variables in a function call ([#4018](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4018)) reported by @[torsrex](https://github.com/torsrex)\r\n- The `opa inspect` command no longer prints a blank namespace when a data.json file is included at the root ([#4022](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4022))\r\n- The `opa build` command will output debug messages if an optimized entrypoint is discarded.\r\n\r\n### Website and Documentation\r\n\r\n- The website has been updated to build with Hugo 0.88.1 ([#3787](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3787))\r\n- The version picker in the documentation is now scrollable ([#3955](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3955)) authored by @[orweis](https://github.com/orweis)\r\n- The description of the `urlquery` built-in functions have been clarified ([#1592](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1592)) reported by @[klarose](https://github.com/klarose)\r\n- The decision logger documentation has been improved to cover controls for large-scale environments ([#3976](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3976))\r\n- The \"strict built-in errors\" mode is now covered in the docs along with built-in function error behaviour ([#3686](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3686))\r\n- The OAuth2 and OIDC examples around key rotation and caching have been improved\r\n\r\n### CI\r\n\r\n- Issues and PRs that have not seen activity in 30 days will be automatically marked as \"inactive\"\r\n- The `Makefile` can now produce Docker images for other architectures. We do not yet publish binaries or images for non-amd64 architectures however if you want to build OPA yourself, the `Makefile` does not prohibit it.\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- The diagnostics buffer in the OPA server has been completely removed as part of the deprecation and removal of the diagnostic feature ([#1052](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1052))", "created_at": "2021-12-01T02:06:13Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.20.1", "tag_name": "v1.20.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.20.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/envoyProxy/envoy", "body": "[Release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.20.1/version_history/current)", "created_at": "2021-11-30T20:28:08Z", "project": "Envoy", "repo": "envoyProxy/envoy", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.1.0", "tag_name": "v2.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.1.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.1.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nWe are excited to introduce Chaos Mesh v2.1.0, which brings the following new features and major enhancements.\r\n\r\n## New Features & Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Introduce PhysicalMachineChaos, which injects node level chaos with chaosd #2235 #2405 #2417 #2499\r\n- Refine JVMChaos with byteman #2366\r\n- Enable lead election for chaos controller manager to achieve high availability  #2291\r\n- Support selecting different interface in NetworkChaos #2290\r\n- Support creating HTTPChaos, JVMChaos, PhysicalMachineChaos on Chaos Dashboard #2417 #2460 #2529 \r\n- Create HTTP Requests through Workflow on Chaos Dashboard #2308\r\n- Display related events and YAML definition for Workflow on Chaos Dashboard #2275\r\n- Integrate GCP Auth in Chaos Dashboard #2220 #2363 #2554\r\n- Migrate docker image from dockerhub to GitHub Container Registry #2476 #2477 #2479 #2483", "created_at": "2021-11-30T12:25:53Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.6.0", "tag_name": "v2.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/harness/drone/releases/tag/v2.6.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/drone/drone", "body": "Changelog [here](https://github.com/harness/drone/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)", "created_at": "2021-11-30T11:58:22Z", "project": "Drone", "repo": "drone/drone", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.12.1rc1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/3740f03b0aee9e717a5641d744ba1bf4b6b99f6f", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.12.1rc1 (#76392)", "created_at": "2021-11-29T20:05:56Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "5.4.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/commit/65b505c46333f09e4503759aa4f37f1cc757d5af", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

Thank you!\r\n\r\nA broad range of improvements, including support for cloud services such as Memcached auto-discovery and Amazon SNS.\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Expose default configuration values to the command line options. Note that setting these explicitly to zero will no longer cause the default to be used. If the default is desired, then do set the option. The following are affected: #4276\r\n  - `-memberlist.stream-timeout`\r\n  - `-memberlist.retransmit-factor`\r\n  - `-memberlist.pull-push-interval`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-interval`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-nodes`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-to-dead-nodes-time`\r\n  - `-memberlist.dead-node-reclaim-time`\r\n* [CHANGE] `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` previously applied to chunks from ingesters and store separately; now the two combined should not exceed the limit. #4260\r\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the metric `memberlist_kv_store_value_bytes` has been removed due to values no longer being stored in-memory as encoded bytes. #4345\r\n* [CHANGE] Some files and directories created by Cortex components on local disk now have stricter permissions, and are only readable by owner, but not group or others. #4394\r\n* [CHANGE] The metric `cortex_deprecated_flags_inuse_total` has been renamed to `deprecated_flags_inuse_total` as part of using grafana/dskit functionality. #4443\r\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: Add new `-ruler.query-stats-enabled` which when enabled will report the `cortex_ruler_query_seconds_total` as a per-user metric that tracks the sum of the wall time of executing queries in the ruler in seconds. #4317\r\n* [FEATURE] Query Frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_series_total` and `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` per-user counters to expose the number of series and bytes fetched as part of queries. These metrics can be enabled with the `-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). #4343\r\n* [FEATURE] AlertManager: Add support for SNS Receiver. #4382\r\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add label `status` to metric `cortex_distributor_ingester_append_failures_total` #4442\r\n* [FEATURE] Queries: Added `present_over_time` PromQL function, also some TSDB optimisations. #4505\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add timeout for waiting on compactor to become ACTIVE in the ring. #4262\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce memory used by streaming queries, particularly in ruler. #4341\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow experimental configuration of disabling of heartbeat timeouts by setting the relevant configuration value to zero. Applies to the following: #4342\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow heartbeats to be explicitly disabled by setting the interval to zero. This is considered experimental. This applies to the following configuration options: #4344\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ingester.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: optimized receive path for processing ring state updates, to help reduce CPU utilization in large clusters. #4345\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: expose configuration of memberlist packet compression via `-memberlist.compression=enabled`. #4346\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Go version to 1.16.6. #4362\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated Prometheus to include changes from prometheus/prometheus#9083. Now whenever `/labels` API calls include matchers, blocks store is queried for `LabelNames` with matchers instead of `Series` calls which was inefficient. #4380\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: performance improvements in socket and memory handling. #4429 #4377\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Exemplars are now emitted for all gRPC calls and many operations tracked by histograms. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New options `-server.http-listen-network` and `-server.grpc-listen-network` allow binding as 'tcp4' or 'tcp6'. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rulers: Using shuffle sharding subring on GetRules API. #4466\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support memcached auto-discovery via `auto-discovery` flag, introduced by thanos in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4487. Both AWS and Google Cloud memcached service support auto-discovery, which returns a list of nodes of the memcached cluster. #4412\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixes a panic in the query-tee when comparing result. #4465\r\n* [BUGFIX] Frontend: Fixes @ modifier functions (start/end) when splitting queries by time. #4464\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: compactor will no longer try to compact blocks that are already marked for deletion. Previously compactor would consider blocks marked for deletion within `-compactor.deletion-delay / 2` period as eligible for compaction. #4328\r\n* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker: when cleaning up obsolete elected replicas from KV store, tracker didn't update number of cluster per user correctly. #4336\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed counting of PromQL evaluation errors as user-errors when updating `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`. #4335\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: When using block storage, prevent any reads or writes while the ingester is stopping. This will prevent accessing TSDB blocks once they have been already closed. #4304\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed ingester stuck on start up (LEAVING ring state) when `-ingester.heartbeat-period=0` and `-ingester.unregister-on-shutdown=false`. #4366\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: panic during shutdown while fetching batches from cache. #4397\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: After query-frontend restart, querier may have lower than configured concurrency. #4417\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: forward only changes, not entire original message. #4419\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: don't accept old tombstones as incoming change, and don't forward such messages to other gossip members. #4420\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed panic when querying exemplars and using `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=false`. #4473\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: honor querier minT,maxT if `nil` SelectHints are passed to Select(). #4413\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed panic while collecting Prometheus metrics. #4483\r\n* [BUGFIX] Update go-kit package to fix spurious log messages #4544\r\n", "created_at": "2021-11-25T15:16:47Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time":

notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#changelog-since-v1223).\r\n\r\n## Known Issues: \r\n* There is [an issue](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4023) that may cause unexpected behavior when removing servers running embedded etcd from the cluster. When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.22.3+k3s1:\r\n\r\n* Updated Kubernetes to v1.22.4 and containerd v1.5.8 [(#4530)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4530)\r\n* Rancher will no longer suggest upgrading the Traefik chart packaged with K3s.

In addition, the following max hop limits will be set by default:\r\n\r\n * worker and API server Nodes, and bastions, will have a limit of 1 hop.\r\n * control plane nodes will have a limit of 3 hops to accommodate for controller Pods without host networking that need to assume roles.\r\n\r\nThis will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  instanceMetadata:\r\n    httpTokens: optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External ServiceAccountPermissions\r\n\r\nMany of kOps addons can now make direct use of external permissions.\r\nThis can be enabled by adding the following to the Cluster spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  iam:\r\n    useServiceAccountExternalPermissions: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only available using the AWS cloud provider.\r\n\r\n## Managed nvidia instances\r\n\r\nkOps can now provision instances with nvidia GPUs and configure it for container workloads without the need of hooks and operators. See [GPU support](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/gpu/)\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* New clusters on AWS will no longer provision an SSH public key by default. To provision\r\n  an SSH public key on a new cluster, use the `--ssh-public-key` flag to `kops create cluster`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. This defers changes to these files until the time of `terraform apply`.\r\n  This feature may be temporarily disabled by turning off the `TerraformManagedFiles` feature flag\r\n  using `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=\"-TerraformManagedFiles\"`.\r\n\r\n* kOps now implements graceful rotation of its Certificate Authorities and the service\r\n  account signing key. See the documentation on [How to rotate all secrets / credentials](../operations/rotate-secrets.md)\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports Debian 11 (Bullseye).\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) as a drop-in replacement for dns-controller.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Control plane pods no longer mount /srv/kubernetes\r\n\r\n For security reasons, `/srv/kubernetes` is no longer mounted in the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager Pods. This also means the files in the default file assets path will be unavailable. If you have file assets or other files needed by kube-apiserver, you must put these into `/srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/` or `/srv/kubernetes/kube-controller-manager`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor file assets, it means adding an explicit path as shown below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  fileAssets:\r\n  - name: audit-policy-config\r\n    path: /srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/audit-policy-config.yaml # make sure you add the path\r\n    roles:\r\n    - Master\r\n    content: |\r\n      apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\r\n      kind: Policy\r\n      rules:\r\n      - level: Metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The legacy addons from `https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons` have been deprecated and will not be available in Kubernetes 1.23+. Use [managed addons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons) instead.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The `assets` phase of `kops update cluster` has been removed. It is replaced by the new `kops get assets --copy` command.\r\n\r\n* Support for importing and converting kubeup clusters has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Cilium and RHEL 8 has been removed. Cilium users will need to migrate to a distribution with a newer Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n* Amazon Linux 2 users are encouraged to use the AMIs based on the 5.10 Linux kernel. See [the documentation](../operations/images.md#amazon-linux-2) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Terraform support now requires Terraform >=0.15.0.\r\n  Users on older versions must follow Terraform's recommended upgrade path of applying one minor version at a time prior to running `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. If, after upgrading kOps and applying a new Terraform plan,\r\n  you subsequently downgrade to an earlier version of kOps, the generated plan will delete these\r\n  files, breaking the cluster. Prior to applying the plan, you will need to orphan all the\r\n  `aws_s3_bucket_object` objects the plan wants to destroy. Use `terraform state rm` on each of them.\r\n  Then re-run `terraform plan` until there are no such objects in the plan.\r\n  \r\n  If you applied the plan without first orphaning all of these objects, fix the cluster by re-running\r\n  `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users of clusters with names beginning with digits will need to move resources prior to upgrading to kOps 1.22. Some of the following commands will need to be run depending on the particular cluster configuration. Confirm the Terraform plan doesn't destroy any of these resources before running `terraform apply`.\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # View the existing terraform resource names for the exact value to use\r\n  HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME=123-cluster-example-com\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_internet_gateway.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_internet_gateway.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_route_table.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_route_table.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* The `TerraformJSON` feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23. Only native HCL2 Terraform output will be supported.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* Support for shell completion has been substantially improved. kOps has added support for shell completion in `fish` and `PowerShell`.\r\n\r\n* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.\r\n\r\n* There is a new command `kops get assets` for listing image and file assets used by a cluster.\r\n  It also includes a `--copy` flag to copy the assets to local repositories.\r\n  See the documentation on [Using local asset repositories](../operations/asset-repository.md) for more information.\r\n  \r\n* kOps now provisions TLS server certificates signed by the Kubernetes general CA to kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.\r\n  The previous behavior of using self-signed certs may be restored by setting `kubeControllerManager.tlsCertFile` and/or\r\n  `kubeScheduler.tlsCertFile` to `\"\"` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now supports the wireguard protocol for transparent encryption.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.22.1 release\r\n\r\n## 1.22.1 to 1.22.2\r\n\r\n* Release 1.22.1

However, Go's embed package does not use OS-specific\n  path separators, so a mismatch between path separators caused a failure in the\n  function.

([#12046](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12046)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where built-in volumes specified by images would not be created correctly under some circumstances.\r\n- Fixed a bug where, when using Podman Machine on OS X, containers in pods did not have working port forwarding from the host ([#12207](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12207)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman network reload` command command on containers using the `slirp4netns` network mode and the `rootlessport` port forwarding driver would make an unnecessary attempt to restart `rootlessport` on containers that did not forward ports.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command would generate YAML including some unnecessary (set to default) fields (e.g. empty SELinux and DNS configuration blocks, and the `privileged` flag when set to false) ([#11995](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11995)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod rm` command could, if interrupted at the right moment, leave a reference to an already-removed infra container behind ([#12034](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12034)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod rm` command would not remove pods with more than one container if all containers save for the infra container were stopped unless `--force` was specified ([#11713](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11713)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--memory` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` did not accept a limit of 0 (which should specify unlimited memory) ([#12002](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12002)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could attempt to build a Dockerfile in the working directory of the `podman system service` instance instead of the Dockerfile specified by the user ([#12054](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12054)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs --tail` command could function improperly (printing more output than requested) when the `journald` log driver was used.\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers run using the `slirp4netns` network mode with IPv6 enabled would not have IPv6 connectivity until several seconds after they started ([#11062](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11062)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some Podman commands could cause an extra `dbus-daemon` process to be created ([#9727](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9727)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would sometimes print warnings about a failure to move the pause process into a given CGroup ([#12065](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12065)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `checkpointed` field in `podman inspect` on a container was not set to false after a container was restored.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would print overly-verbose logs about request IDs ([#12181](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12181)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, when creating a new container without a name explicitly specified by the user, sometimes use an auto-generated name already in use by another container if multiple containers were being created in parallel ([#11735](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11735)).\r\n", "created_at":

To enable it the flag `buffer_implementation` should be set to `keyspace_events`.\r\nThe existing implementation (flag value `healthcheck`) will be deprecated in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n### CLI command output\r\nWherever CLI commands produced `master` or `MASTER` for tablet type, they now produce `primary` or `PRIMARY`.\r\nScripts and tools that depend on parsing command output will need to change.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```sh\r\n$ vtctlclient -server localhost:15999 ListAllTablets \r\nzone1-0000000100 sourcekeyspace 0 primary 192.168.0.134:15100 192.168.0.134:17100 [] 2021-09-24T01:12:00Z\r\nzone1-0000000101 sourcekeyspace 0 rdonly 192.168.0.134:15101 192.168.0.134:17101 [] <null>\r\nzone1-0000000102 sourcekeyspace 0 replica 192.168.0.134:15102 192.168.0.134:17102 [] <null>\r\nzone1-0000000103 sourcekeyspace 0 rdonly 192.168.0.134:15103 192.168.0.134:17103 [] <null>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Default Behaviour Changes\r\n\r\n### Enabling reserved connections\r\nUse of reserved connections is controlled by the vtgate flag `-enable_system_settings`. This flag has in the past defaulted to `false` (or `OFF`) in release versions (i.e. x.0 and x.0.y) of Vitess, and to `true` (or `ON`) in development versions.\r\n\r\nFrom Vitess 12.0.0 onwards, it defaults to ***true*** in all release and development versions. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/9125). Hence you should specify this flag explicitly, so that you are sure whether it is enabled or not, regardless of which Vitess release/build/version you are running.\r\n\r\nIf you have reserved connections disabled, you will get the ***old*** Vitess behavior: where most system settings (e.g. `sql_mode`) are just silently ignored by Vitess. In situations where you know your backend MySQL defaults are acceptable, this may be the correct setting to ensure the best possible performance of the vttablet <-> MySQL connection pools. This comes down to a trade-off between compatibility and performance/scalability. You should also review [this section](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/query-serving/reserved-conn/#number-of-vttablet---mysql-connections) of the documentation when deciding whether or not to enable reserved connections.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n### CLI commands\r\n`VExec` is deprecated and removed. All Online DDL commands should be run through `OnlineDDL`.\r\n\r\n`OnlineDDL revert` is deprecated. Use `REVERT VITESS_MIGRATION '...'` SQL command either via `ApplySchema` or via `vtgate`.\r\n\r\n`InitShardMaster` is deprecated, use `InitShardPrimary` instead.\r\n\r\n`SetShardIsMasterServing` is deprecated, use `SetShardIsPrimaryServing` instead.\r\n\r\nVarious command flags have been deprecated and new variants provided.\r\n* `DeleteTablet` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `PlannedReparentShard` flag `avoid_master` replaced with `avoid_tablet`\r\n* `PlannedReparentShard` flag `new_master` replaced with `new_primary`\r\n* `BackupShard` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `Backup` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `EmergencyReparentShard` flag `new_master` replaced with `new_primary`\r\n* `ReloadSchemeShard` flag `include_master` replaced with `include_primary`\r\n* `ReloadSchemaKeyspace` flag `include_master` replaced with `include_primary`\r\n* `ValidateSchemaKeyspace` flag `skip-no-master` replaced with `skip-no-primary`\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n### Query Serving\r\n* Add `SHOW VITESS_REPLICATION_STATUS` Query Support #8900 \r\n  * The new `SHOW VITESS_REPLICATION_STATUS` command/query shows the MySQL replica/replication (not `vreplication`) health for the vitess deployment.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n* Added @GuptaManan100 to maintainers #8833\r\n\r\n------------\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n#### Build/CI\r\n * Update golang/x dependencies #8688\r\n * tests: use AtomicInt32 instead of int to fix races #8696\r\n#### Cluster management\r\n * Use consul lock properly #8310\r\n * Trivial: mysqlctl reinit_config -h  was not showing help #8369\r\n * Port #8422 to main branch #8745\r\n * [vtctl] Add missing call to `flag.Parse` in `commandGetRoutingRules` #8795\r\n * Fix for padding in OrderAndCheckPartitions  #8873\r\n * tabletmanager: correct implementations of deprecated RPCs for backwards compatibility #9059\r\n#### General\r\n * Avoid some pollution of CLI argument namespace across vtgate and vttablet #9026\r\n#### Observability\r\n * schema engine: reset table size stats when a table is dropped #8634\r\n#### Query Serving\r\n * Fix for function calls in DEFAULT value of CREATE TABLE statement in main #8477\r\n * Fixing multiple issues related to onlineddl/lifecycle #8500\r\n * boolean values should not be parenthesised in default clause #8502\r\n * mysql/server: abort connection if secure transport is required #8504\r\n * Clear only the current shard's schemacopy rows  during schema reload #8519\r\n * go/mysql/auth: fix error message for wrong auth method. #8525\r\n * Fix handshake protocol with MySQL client #8537\r\n * Copy parameter data from byte buffer in COM_STMT_SEND_LONG_DATA #8562\r\n * Negative float default #8587\r\n * [vtexplain] prevent panic on show tables/show full tables #8601\r\n * OnlineDDL: better scheduling/cancellation logic #8603\r\n * Fix parsing of FIRST clause in ALTER TABLE #8614\r\n * onlineddl Executor: build schema with DBA user #8624\r\n * Handle subquery merging with references correctly #8662\r\n * Fixing error on deletes from owning table for a lookup being populated by CreateLookupVindex after a SwitchWrites #8701\r\n * Fixing a panic in vtgate with OLAP mode #8722\r\n * default to primary tablet if not set in VStream api #8755\r\n * Fix bug in parsing of version comments #8770\r\n * Proper merge of the SysTableTableName fields when joining two routes #8771\r\n * fix parsing of MySQL Server Version flag #8791\r\n * Fix typo in pool config syntax.

culmination of efforts geared towards laying the foundation for making it easier to onboard and accept community contributions, making each of the data engine operators ready for future Kubernetes releases, making it easy to manage, and troubleshoot various data engines. This has been achieved via migration to the latest Kubernetes constructs, ease of use improvements, bug fixes and most importantly refactoring the control plane and e2e test suites to independently enhance and release each of the engines. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them till Dec 2021. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.0.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.0.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.8.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.5.1 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.7.1 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.7.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.4.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.7 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Added support for pushing the [container images to GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/packages), in addition to pushing the to DockerHub and Quay.io.\r\n* Rename the branches to \"develop\" or \"main\" on all the active repositories which are accepting contributions. \r\n* Update the CRD references to v1 across all components - even with deprecated provisioners - so users can continue to use the older provisioners beyond 1.22 as well. \r\n* Update the Kubernetes CSI driver side-cars to the latest version compatible with Kubernetes 1.18 and higher. \r\n* Enhance the iSCSI Targets functionality in Jiva and cStor volumes to only accept connections from one node at a time. The connection from a new node will be accepted only after the previous connection is torn down. \r\n* Enhanced the Local PV hostpath with a feature to enforce capacity limits using XFS quota - for volumes provisioned on XFS filesystem. \r\n* Enhanced the Jiva Specs (Jiva Volume Policy) to remove unused fields and make most of the fields with default configuration as optional. Also fixed the issues around specifying pod affinity and anti-affinity policies on jiva replica and target.\r\n* Enhanced the NDM operator and helm chart to include NDM exporter. \r\n* Enhanced NDM to detect filesystem and size changes, and update the block device resource. (under feature-gate in this release).\r\n* Dashboard and CLI have made enhanced their support to display details about cStor, Jiva, ZFS, LVM and Device Local PV. \r\n* Enhanced OpenEBS helm chart that can easily enable or disable a data engine of choice. The 3.0 helm chart stops installing the legacy cstor and jiva provisioners. If you would like to continue to use them, you have to set the flag \u201clegacy.enabled=true\u201d. \r\n* OpenEBS helm chart includes sample kyverno policies that can be used as an option for PodSecurityPolicies(PSP) replacement. \r\n* New revamped website for [https://openebs.io](https://openebs.io) is live. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @turowicz(Surveily), @WillyRL(Teknologi Anak Rantau Indonesia), @Somsubhra1, @t3hmrman for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable. Thanks also to @anuraaga @jorgheymans @jcchavezs and @abesto for inputs and review.", "created_at": "2020-10-31T15:23:43Z", "project": "Zipkin", "repo": "openzipkin/zipkin", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.12.3", "tag_name": "v0.12.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.12.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs", "body": "### Fixed\r\n\r\n- _Regression:_ When running Gogs on Windows, push commits no longer fail on a daily basis with the error \"pre-receive hook declined\".
