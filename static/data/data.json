may cause issues with authentication caused by the AD FS Relying Party Trust not being able to pick up a signature verification certificate from the metadata, that requires manual intervention. This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...) or by directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Review the Install/Upgrade Notes before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\nRancher v2.10.3 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nFor more information on new features in the general minor release see the [v2.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.0).\r\n\r\n## Security Fixes for Rancher Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following Rancher security issues:\r\n\r\n- The User ID required for configuring SAML providers is now stored inside a signed JSON Web Token (JWT), ensuring it is securely protected against tampering. For more information, see [CVE-2025-23389](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-5qmp-9x47-92q8) and [#48964](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/48964).\r\n- Rancher now allows only the `GET` method for the public `/v3-public/authProviders` endpoint. For more information, see [CVE-2025-23388](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-xr9q-h9c7-xw8q) and [#48608](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/48608).\r\n- Rancher no longer supports the `GET` and `DELETE` methods for the public `/v3-public/authTokens` endpoint. For more information, see [CVE-2025-23387](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-mq23-vvg7-xfm4) and [#48616](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/48616).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.10/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) or in Rancher's [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories) repository.\r\n\r\n## Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- [Extensions](https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rancher-manager/v2.10/en/integrations/rancher-extensions.html) are not loaded after logging in via a LDAP authentication provider. As a workaround, refresh the page again after logging in. See [#13499](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/13499).\r\n\r\n## Changes Since v2.10.2\r\n\r\nSee the full list of [issues addressed](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av2.10.3+is%3Aclosed).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, EOL for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must replatform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about replatforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.10.3\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.10.1](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.10.1)\r\n- RKE - [v1.7.3](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.7.3)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.31.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.30.9\r\n- v1.29.13\r\n- v1.28.15\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.31.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.30.9\r\n- v1.29.13\r\n- v1.28.15\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI. \r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.27 is no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.10.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later. See [#47591](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47591).\r\n  - The new annotation `field.cattle.io/creator-principal-name` was introduced in addition to the existing `field.cattle.io/creatorId` that allows specifying the creator's principal name when creating a cluster or a project. If this annotation is used, the `userPrincipalName` field of the corresponding `ClusterRoleTemplateBinding` or `ProjectRoleTemplateBinding` will be set to the specified principal. The principal should belong to the creator's user, which is enforced by the webhook. See [#46828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46828).\r\n  - When searching for group principals with a SAML authentication provider (with LDAP turned off), Rancher now returns a principal of correct type (group) with the name matching the search term. When searching principals with a SAML provider (with LDAP turned off) without specifying the desired type (as in Add cluster/project member), Rancher now returns both user and group principals with the name matching the search term. See [#44441](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44441).\r\n  - Rancher now captures the last used time for Tokens and stores it in the `lastUsedAt` field. If the Authorized Cluster Endpoint is enabled and used on a downstream cluster Rancher captures the last used time in the `ClusterAuthToken` object and makes the best effort to sync it back to the corresponding Token in the upstream. See [#45732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45732).\r\n  - Rancher deploys the System Upgrade Controller (SUC) to facilitate Kubernetes upgrades for imported RKE2/K3s clusters. Starting with this version, the mechanism used to deploy this component in downstream clusters has transitioned from legacy V1 apps to fully supported V2 apps, providing a seamless upgrade process for Rancher. For more details, please see this [issue comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42448#issuecomment-2477309567).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - The deprecated subcommand `globaldns` was removed from the Rancher CLI. See [#48127](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48127).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - This release includes a major upgrade to the Dashboard (Cluster Explorer) Vue framework from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Please view our documentation on updating existing UI extensions to be compliant with the Rancher v2.10 UI framework in the [v2.10.0 UI extension changelog](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/next/rancher-2.10-support). If experiencing a page that fails to load please file an issue via the [Dashboard repository](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/new/choose) and choose the \"Bug report\" option for us to further investigate. See [#7653](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7653).\r\n  - The performance of the Clusters lists in the Home page and the Side Menu has greatly improved when there are hundreds of clusters. See [#11995](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11995) and [#11993](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11993).\r\n  - The previous Dashboard Ember UI (Cluster Manager) will no longer be directly accessible. The relative pages that rely on the previous UI will continue to be embedded in the new Vue UI (Cluster Explorer). See [#11371](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11371).\r\n  - Updated the data directory configuration by replacing the checkbox option with 3 user input options below:\r\n    1. `Use default data directory configuration`\r\n    2. `Use a common base directory for data directory configuration (sub-directories will be used for the system-agent, provisioning and distro paths)` - This option displays a text input where users can enter a base directory for all 3 subdirectories which Rancher programmatically appends to the correct subdirectories.\r\n    3. `Use custom data directories` - This option displays 3 text inputs, one for each subdirectory type where users can input each path individually.\r\n\r\n    See [#11560](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11560).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\n    Please note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must replatform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\n    RKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about replatforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Virtualization (Harvester)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - On the Cloud Credential list, you can now easily see if a Harvester Credential is about to expire or has expired and choose to renew it. You will also be notified on the Cluster Management Clusters list when an associated Harvester Cloud Credential is about to expire or has expired. When upgrading, an existing expired Harvester Credential will not contain a warning. You can still renew the token on the resources menu. See [#11332](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11332).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Windows\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Rancher v2.10.0 includes changes to how Windows nodes behave post node reboot, as well as provides two new settings to control how Windows services created by Rancher behave on startup.\r\n\r\n    Two new agent environment variables have been added for Windows nodes, `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_SERVICE_DEPENDENCY` and `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_DELAYED_START`. These changes can be configured in the Rancher UI, and will be respected by all nodes running `rancher-wins` version `v0.4.20` or greater.\r\n\r\n    - `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_SERVICE_DEPENDENCY` defines a service dependency between RKE2 and `rancher-wins`, ensuring RKE2 will not start before `rancher-wins`.\r\n    - `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_DELAYED_START` changes the start type of `rancher-wins` to `AUTOMATIC (DELAYED)`, ensuring it starts after other Windows services.\r\n\r\n    Additionally, Windows nodes will now attempt to execute plans multiple times if the initial application fails, up to 5 times. This change, as well as appropriate use of the above two agent environment variables, aims to address plan failures for Windows nodes after a node reboot.\r\n\r\n    See [#42458](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42458).\r\n  - A change was made starting with RKE2 versions `v1.28.15`, `v1.29.10`, `v1.30.6` and `v1.31.2` on Windows which allows the user to configure `*_PROXY` environment variables on the `rke2` service after the node has already been provisioned.\r\n\r\n    Previously any attempt to do so would be a no-op. With this change, If the `*_PROXY` environment variables are set on the cluster _after_ a Windows node is provisioned, they can be automatically removed from the `rke2` service. However, if the variables are set _before_ the node is provisioned, they cannot be removed.\r\n\r\n    More information can be found [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47839). A workaround is to remove the environment variables from the `rancher-wins` service and restart the service or node. At which point `*_PROXY` environment variables will no longer be set on either service.\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    Remove-ItemProperty HKLM:SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\rancher-wins -Name Environment\r\n    Restart-Service rancher-wins\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    See [#47544](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47544).\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11435](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11435).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.1**:\r\n  - The Rancher CLI uses dedicated HTTP clients in login and SSH commands to download certificates and an SSH key respectively. However, the CLI currently does not respect proxy settings and does not set an HTTP timeout. See [#48321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48321).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2**:\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7**:\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery (Fleet)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Target customization for namespace labels and annotations cannot modify/remove labels when updating. See [#3064](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/3064).\r\n  - In version 0.10, GitRepo resources provided a comprehensive list of all deployed resources across all clusters in their status. However, in version 0.11, this list has been modified to report resources only once until the feature is integrated into the Rancher UI. While this change addresses a UI freeze issue, it may result in potential inaccuracies in the list of resources and resource counts under some conditions.

Guide](https://docs.nats.io/release-notes/whats_new/whats_new_210) for backwards compatibility notes with 2.9.x.\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n\r\n- 1.23.6 (#6452)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- github.com/nats-io/nats.go v1.39.1 (#6574)\r\n- golang.org/x/crypto v0.34.0 (#6574)\r\n- golang.org/x/sys v0.30.0 (#6487)\r\n- golang.org/x/time v0.10.0 (#6487)\r\n- github.com/nats-io/nkeys v0.4.10 (#6494)\r\n- github.com/klauspost/compress v1.18.0 (#6565)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- New server option `no_fast_producer_stall` allows disabling the stall gates, instead preferring to drop messages to consumers that would have resulted in a stall instead (#6500)\r\n- New server option `first_info_timeout` to control how long a leafnode connection should wait for the initial connection info, useful for high latency links (#5424)\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\n\r\n- The `gatewayz` monitoring endpoint can now return subscription information (#6525)\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- The configured write deadline is now applied to only the current batch of write vectors (with a maximum of 64MB), making it easier to configure and reason about (#6471)\r\n- Publishing through a service import to an account with no interest will now generate a \"no responders\" error instead of silently dropping the message (#6532)\r\n- Adjust the stall gate for producers to be less penalizing (#6568, #6579)\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- Consumer signaling from streams has been optimized, taking consumer filters into account, significantly reducing CPU usage and overheads when there are a large number of consumers with sparse or non-overlapping interest (#6499)\r\n- Num pending with multiple filters, enforcing per-subject limits and loading the per-subject info now use a faster subject tree lookup with fewer allocations (#6458)\r\n- Optimizations for calculating num pending etc. by handling literal subjects using a faster path (#6446)\r\n- Optimizations for loading the next message with multiple filters by avoiding linear scans in message blocks in some cases, particularly where there are lots of deletes or a small number of subjects (#6448)\r\n- Avoid unnecessary system time calls when ranging a large number of interior deletes, reducing CPU time (#6450)\r\n- Removed unnecessary locking around finding out if Raft groups are leaderless, reducing contention (#6438)\r\n- Improved the error message when trying to change the consumer type (#6408)\r\n- Improved the error messages returned by `healthz` to be more descriptive about why the healthcheck failed (#6416)\r\n- The limit of concurrent disk I/O operations that JetStream can perform simultaneously has been raised (#6449)\r\n- Reduced the number of allocations needed for handling client info headers around the JetStream API and service imports/exports (#6453)\r\n- Calculating the starting sequence for a source consumer has been optimized for streams where there are many interior deletes (#6461)\r\n- Messages used for cluster replication are now correctly accounted for in the statistics of the origin account (#6474)\r\n- Reduce the amount of time taken for cluster nodes to start campaigning in some cases (#6511) \r\n- Reduce memory allocations when writing new messages to the filestore write-through cache (#6576)\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\n\r\n- The `routez` endpoint now reports `pending_bytes` (#6476)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- The `max_closed_clients` option is now parsed correctly from the server configuration file (#6497)\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- A bug in the subject state tracking that could result in in consumers skipping messages on interest or WQ streams has been fixed (#6526)\r\n- A data race between the stream config and looking up streams has been fixed (#6424) Thanks to @evankanderson!\r\n- Fixed an issue where Raft proposals were incorrectly dropped after a peer remove operation, which could result in a stream desync (#6456)\r\n- Stream disk reservations will no longer be counted multiple times after stream reset errors have occurred (#6457)\r\n- Fixed an issue where a stream could desync if the server exited during a catchup (#6459)\r\n- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when cleaning up large numbers of consumers that have reached their inactivity threshold (#6460)\r\n- A bug which could result in stuck consumers after a leader change has been fixed (#6469)\r\n- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to update a stream or consumer if up against the max streams or max consumers limit (#6477)\r\n- The preferred stream leader will no longer respond if it has not completed setting up the Raft node yet, fixing some API timeouts on stream info and other API calls shortly after the stream is created (#6480)\r\n- Auth callouts can now correctly authenticate the username and password or authorization token from a leafnode connection (#6492)\r\n- Stream ingest from an imported subject will now continue to work correctly after an update to imports/exports via a JWT update (#6498)\r\n- Parallel stream creation requests for the same stream will no longer incorrectly return a limits error when max streams is configured (#6502)\r\n- Consumers created or recreated while a cluster node was down are now handled correctly after a snapshot when the node comes back online (#6507)\r\n- Invalidate entries in the pending append entry cache correctly, reducing the chance of an incorrect apply (#6513)\r\n- When compacting or truncating streams or logs, correctly clean up the delete map, fixing potential memory leaks and the potential for `index.db` to not be recovered correctly after a restart (#6515)\r\n- Retry removals from acks if they have been missed due to the consumer ack floor being ahead of the stream applies, correcting a potential stream drift across replicas (#6519)\r\n- When recovering from block files, do not put deleted messages below the first sequence into the delete map (#6521)\r\n- Preserve max delivered messages with interest retention policy using the redelivered state, such that a new consumer will not unexpectedly remove the message (#6575)\r\n\r\nLeafnodes\r\n\r\n- Do not incorrectly send duplicate messages when a queue group has members across different leafnodes when connected through a gateway (#6517)\r\n\r\nWebSockets\r\n\r\n- Fixed a couple cases where memory may not be reclaimed from Flate compressors correctly after a WebSocket client disconnect or error scenario (#6451)\r\n\r\nTests\r\n\r\n- Unit tests have been improved (#6406, #6447, #6472, #6524)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n \r\nhttps://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/compare/v2.10.25...v2.10.26",

See [Alpine 3.21.3 release notes](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.18.12-3.19.7-3.20.6-3.21.3-released.html).\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/): allow disabling per-day indexes for workloads with [low or zero churn rates](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#index-tuning-for-low-churn-rate) via `-disablePerDayIndex` cmd-line flag. This option works the best for IoT cases and significantly loads resource and disk usage. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6976).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): add command-line flag `-notifier.sendTimeout(default 10s)` to allow configuring request timeout when sending alerts to the corresponding `-notifier.url`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8287) for details. Thanks to @gjkim42 for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8297).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): add support of [aggregation windows](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#aggregation-windows) to improve accuracy of stream aggregation. This feature is especially important for aggregation of [histrograms](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyconcepts/#histogram), but enabling this feature requires additional memory. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4580).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add `-influx.forceStreamMode` cmd-line flag to force stream processing for data ingested via [InfluxDB protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8269).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): support overriding vmstorage `-maxUniqueTimeseries` with specific resource limits: `-search.maxLabelsAPISeries`, `-search. maxSeries`, `-search.maxTSDBStatusSeries` and `-search.maxDeleteSeries`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7857).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add legend customization options - table view, hiding common values, grouping by label, and custom label format. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8031) and [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8263).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): look back for recent data for longer time intervals when switching to Table or JSON view. The look back window depends on the `step` setting, which is now set as `end - start` (30m) by default. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): preserve user-defined `step` setting when changing the time interval of displayed query. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8240#issuecomment-2647674065).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve numbers formatting for better readability on the `Explore Cardinality` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8318).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): print full error messages for failed queries on the `Explore Cardinality` page. Before, only response status code was printed. \r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): move values representing changes relative to the previous day to a separate column for easier sorting on the `Explore Cardinality` page.\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): support auto-format (prettify) for expressions that use quoted metric or label names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7703) for details.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: all the VictoriaMetrics components: properly override basic authorization for API endpoints protected with `authKey`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345#issuecomment-2662595807) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix polluted alert messages when multiple Alertmanager instances are configured with `alert_relabel_configs`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8040), and thanks to @evkuzin for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/8258).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix the auto-generated metrics for alerts and groups. Previously, metrics might be missing after reload. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8229) for the details.\r\n* BUGFIX: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly return parsing errors during data ingestion in [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#multi-level-cluster-setup). Before, some of the errors could have been silently ignored.\r\n* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly enforce presence of default `-retentionPeriod` configuration for [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention-filters) debug interface.

A key highlight is Mayastor's new support for RDMA as a transport protocol for volume targets over NVMe over Fabrics (NVMeoF). In addition, the release includes various usability and functional fixes for both the LocalPV ZFS and LocalPV Hostpath provisioners, along with documentation enhancements to help users and new contributors get started quickly.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n### Local Storage\r\n- **ZFS Enhancements:**\r\n  - Support for the `zstd-fast` compression algorithm in LocalPV ZFS.\r\n  - Flexibility to choose between `refquota` or `quota` for ZFS volumes.\r\n  - Fixes in volume provisioning, controller behavior, reservation, and deployment.\r\n- **LocalPV Hostpath Improvements:**\r\n  - Eviction tolerations added to the Hostpath provisioner deployment.\r\n  - Helper pod now allowed to use the host network.\r\n  - Added a global `imageRegistry` Helm parameter for specifying an image registry for all images.\r\n\r\n### LocalPV Release Notes\r\n\r\n- **LocalPV-ZFS:**  \r\n  Refer to the [LocalPV-ZFS v2.7.1 release](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/releases/tag/v2.7.1) for detailed changes.\r\n- **LocalPV Hostpath:**  \r\n  Refer to the [LocalPV Hostpath v4.2.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues for LocalPV\r\n- **Controller Pod Restart on Single Node Setups:**  \r\n  After upgrading, single node setups may face issues where the ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv controller pod does not enter the Running state due to changes in the controller manifest (now a Deployment) and missing affinity rules.\r\n  - **Workaround:** Delete the old controller pod to allow the new pod to be scheduled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Replicated Storage (Mayastor)\r\n- **NVMe-oF RDMA Support:**\r\n  - Mayastor volume targets can now be shared over RDMA transport, providing high throughput and reduced latency.\r\n  - Enabled via a Helm chart option that works in conjunction with specifying an RDMA-capable network interface.\r\n- **CSAL ftl bdev Support:**\r\n  - Integration of the SPDK ftl bdev (Cloud Storage Acceleration Layer) to support layered devices with a fast cache for buffering writes.\r\n- **Additional Enhancements:**\r\n  - Detection of the builtin `nvme-tcp` module on Talos-like platforms.\r\n  - Stability fixes in volume target failover and application move scenarios.\r\n  - Eviction tolerations added to the DSP operator deployment and CSI-controller for faster failover.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n- **Kubernetes Requirement:** Kubernetes 1.23 or higher is recommended.\r\n- **Engine Compatibility:** Upgrades to OpenEBS 4.2.0 are supported only for the following engines:\r\n  - Local PV Hostpath\r\n  - Local PV LVM\r\n  - Local PV ZFS\r\n  - Mayastor (from earlier editions, 3.10.x or below)\r\n\r\n## Replicated PV Mayastor Release Notes\r\n\r\n- **Mayastor**  \r\n  Refer to the [Mayastor v2.8.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor/releases/tag/v2.7.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## Known Behavioural Limitations\r\n- The Mayastor IO engine fully utilizes allocated CPU cores regardless of I/O load, running a poller at full speed.\r\n- A Mayastor DiskPool is limited to a single block device and cannot span multiple block devices.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n### Replicated PV (Mayastor)\r\n- **DiskPool Capacity Expansion:**  \r\n  Mayastor does not support the capacity expansion of DiskPools as of v2.8.0.\r\n- **IO-Engine Pod Restarts:**  \r\n  Under heavy I/O and during constant scaling up/down of volume replicas, the io-engine pod may restart occasionally.\r\n- **fsfreeze Operation Failure:**  \r\n  If a pod-based workload is scheduled on a node that reboots and the pod lacks a controller (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), the volume unpublish operation might not be triggered. This leads the control plane to assume the volume is still published, causing the fsfreeze operation to fail during snapshot creation.\r\n  - **Workaround:** Recreate or reinstate the pod to ensure proper volume mounting.\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-02-17T10:09:16Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "3.5.0", "tag_name": "3.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/releases/tag/3.5.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\nZipkin now supports [Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) as a span transport, enabled by `PULSAR_SERVICE_URL` and documented [here](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server#pulsar-collector).

This support is very early and not fully complete, and the command line interface for these tools has not been finalized. We welcome feedback on the new artifact experience through our issue tracker!\r\n- The `podman update` command now supports a wide variety of options related to healthchecks (including `--health-cmd` to define a new healthcheck and `--no-healthcheck` to disable an existing healthcheck), allowing healthchecks to be added to, removed from, and otherwise updated on existing containers. You can find full details on the 15 added options in the manpage.\r\n- The `--mount type=volume` option for the `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman volume create` commands now supports a new option, `subpath=`, to make only a subset of the volume visible in the container ([#20661](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20661)).\r\n- The `--userns=keep-id` option for the `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now supports a new option, `--userns=keep-id:size=`, to configure the size of the user namespace ([#24387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24837)).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports Container Device Interface (CDI) devices ([#17833](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17833)).\r\n- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--playbook`, to run an Ansible playbook in the created VM on first boot for initial configuration.\r\n- Quadlet `.pod` files now support a new field, `ShmSize`, to specify the size of the pod's shared SHM ([#22915](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22915)).\r\n- The `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now support a new option, `--hosts-file`, to define the base file used for `/etc/hosts` in the container.\r\n- The `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now support a new option, `--no-hostname`, which disables the creation of `/etc/hostname` in the container ([#25002](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25002)).\r\n- The `podman network create` command now supports a new option for `bridge` networks, `--opt mode=unmanaged`, which allows Podman to use an existing network bridge on the system without changes.\r\n- The `--network` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` now accepts a new option for `bridge` networks, `host_interface_name`, which specifies a name for the network interface created outside the container.\r\n- The `podman manifest rm` command now supports a new option, `--ignore`, to not error when removing manifests that do not exist.\r\n- The `podman system prune` command now supports a new option, `--build`, to remove build containers leftover from prematurely terminated builds.\r\n- The `podman events` command now generates events for the creation and removal of networks ([#24032](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24032)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n- Due to a lack of availability of hardware to test on, the Podman maintainers are no longer capable of providing full support for Podman on Intel Macs. Binaries and machine images will still be produced, and pull requests related to MacOS on Intel systems will still be merged, but bugs will be fixed on a best effort basis only. We welcome any potential new maintainers who would be able to assist in restoring full support.\r\n- Quadlet previously incorrectly allowed `:` as a character to define comments. This was a mistake; developer intent and documentation was that `#` and `;` were to be used as comment characters instead, matching systemd. This has been corrected, and semicolons now define comments instead of colons.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Podman now passes container hostnames to Netavark, which will use them for any DHCP requests for the container.\r\n- Partial pulls of `zstd:chunked` images now only happen for images that have a `RootFS.DiffID` entry in the image's OCI config JSON, and require the layer contents to match. This resolves issues with image ID ambiguity when partial pulls were enabled.\r\n- Packagers can now set the `BUILD_ORIGIN` environment variable when building podman from the `Makefile`. This provides information on who built the Podman binary, and is displayed in `podman version` and  `podman info`. This will help upstream bug reports, allowing maintainers to trace how and where the binary was built and installed from.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine` VMs on WSL could fail to start when using usermode networking could fail to start due to a port conflict ([#20327](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20327)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where overlay mounts could not be made at paths where the image specifies a volume ([#24555](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24555)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command did not honor the `no_pivot_root` setting from `containers.conf` ([#24546](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24546)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where volumes would have the wrong permissions if `podman cp` was used to copy into a fresh volume in a container that had never been started.\r\n- Fixed a bug where using `podman cp` to copy into a named volume requiring a mount (image volumes, volumes backed by a volume plugin, or other volumes with options) would fail when the container being copied into was stopped.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rlimits would be set incorrectly when Podman was run as root but without `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` ([#24692](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24692)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats --all` command would fail if a container started with `--cgroups=none` was present ([#24632](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24632)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command would only return details on one image store even if additional image stores were configured in `storage.conf`.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman update` command could reset resource limits that were not being modified to default ([#24610](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24610)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman update` command could not update resource limits on devices mounted into the container ([#24734](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24734)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest annotate` command could panic when the `--index` option was used ([#24750](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24750)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a Quadlet container reusing another container's network could cause errors if the second container was not already running.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet files containing lines with a trailing backslash could cause an infinite loop during parsing ([#24810](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24810)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet would, when run as a non-root user, not generate for files in subfolders of `/etc/containers/systemd/users/` ([#24783](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24783)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where values in Quadlet files containing octal escape sequences were incorrectly unescaped.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman generate kube` could generate persistent volumes with mixed-case names or names containing an underscore, which are not supported by Kubernetes ([#16542](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16542)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `ptmxmode` option to `--mount type=devpts` did not function.\r\n- Fixed a bug where shell completion on Windows would include `.exe` in the executable name, breaking completion on some shells.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the output of `podman inspect` on containers did not include the ID of the network the container was joined to, improving Docker compatibility ([#24910](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24910)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with the remote API incorrectly included a create command ([#25026](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25026)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where it was possible to specify the `libkrun` backend for VMs on Intel Macs (`libkrun` only supports Arm systems).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `libkrun` and `applehv` VMs from `podman machine` could be started at the same time on Macs ([#25112](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25112)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman exec` commands could not detach from the exec session using the detach keys ([#24895](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24895)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start due to a database configuration mismatch when certain fields were configured to the empty string ([#24738](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24738)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Compat and Libpod Build APIs for Images now support a new query parameter, `nohosts`, which (when set to true) does not create `/etc/hosts` in the image when building.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create API for Containers did not honor CDI devices, preventing (among other things) the use of GPUs with `docker compose` ([#19338](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19338)).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The Docker alias script has been fixed to better handle variable substitution.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman-restart.service` functioned incorrectly when no containers were present.\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.39.0\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.62.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.57.1\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.34.0", "created_at": "2025-02-11T16:08:16Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type":

In previous versions of Packer, the\n      data sources were evaluated first, then the local variables were, making\n      it impossible to have a datasource that referenced a local variable as\n      part of its configuration.\n      This change introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to evaluate those\n      resources, instead of the phased approach of old, which makes the order\n      of evaluation not dependent on the type of resource, but instead of the\n      detected dependencies between them.\n      **Note**: While we are confident this should be robust enough for general\n      use, we do recognise that it is possible some users might encounter issues.\n      To give those users a way to continue using the old evaluation method, we\n      introduced a `-use-sequential-evaluation` command-line flag to the build,\n      validate, console and inspect subcommands, to force using the sequential\n      evaluation approach for those entities.\n      [GH-13155](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13155)\n\n* core/hcp: support for uploading SBOMs to HCP Packer.\n      Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) are a standardised way to export the various\n      software packages linked to an artifact. As some users have expressed a\n      need to produce and access those for images they build, we now add the\n      feature to Packer itself.\n      While the generation of the SBOM itself is not done directly by\n      Packer, instead we recommend using known scanners to produce them, we add\n      the capacity to upload this SBOM file to HCP Packer, and link it to a\n      build artifact.\n      [GH-13171](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13171)\n\n* core: support for alternate serialisation formats for plugin communication.\n      Packer relies on plugins to do most of the actual workload related to\n      building and provisioing artifacts, while Packer is mostly an orchestrator\n      for those plugins to perform their work.\n      This separation of concerns implies that both entities have to\n      communicate on multiple occasions during the course of a build.\n      Before v1.12.0 of Packer, and v0.6.0 of the plugin SDK, we used Gob to\n      do most of the serialisation for those steps.\n      This is however a bit of a problem recently, as go-cty, the library we\n      use for dynamic objects lifted from HCL templates, dropped support for\n      this a while back.\n      Therefore now, we introduce an alternative: protobuf/msgpack, which are\n      both usable and maintained by the projects around Packer, so we can begin\n      our transition away from gob with this change.\n      **Note**: as with the introduction of the DAG for locals/datasources, this\n      is a feature that we are reasonably confident you will not encounter bugs\n      with, however we cannot rule-out this possibility, therefore we introduce\n      a new environment variable: `PACKER_FORCE_GOB`, which if set to '1', forces\n      the use of Gob instead of protobuf/msgpack.\n      [GH-13120](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13120)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* hcl2/json: add `aws_secretsmanager_raw` funcion.\n      When using the AWS secretsmanager function with a non-text secret, one could\n      only get a secret once at a time.\n      This could get cumbersome if wanting to get multiple through one request,\n      which led people to encode their JSON/Object secrets as a big base64\n      encoded string that they could get once, and then manipulate through JSON\n      functions.\n      While the workaround works, it is one extra layer of manipulations to do so,\n      therefore a new function to always get the raw textual version of a secret\n      is now added to Packer.\n      [GH-13242](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13242)\n* hcl2: add `alltrue` and `anytrue` functions.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL functions `alltrue` and\n      `anytrue`, which returns whether or not a collection only consists of\n      `true` values, or if any is.\n      [GH-13237](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13237)\n* hcl2: add `strcontains` function.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL function `strcontains`,\n      which returns whether or not a string contains a substring within it.\n      [GH-13217](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13217)\n      [GH-13222](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13222)\n* datasource/http: Support other methods than GET.\n      The HTTP datasource used to always use GET requests for getting data\n      from a remote HTTP server, which was not always enough since some endpoints\n      may only support other methods. This change allows for most of the HTTP\n      methods to perform those requests.\n      [GH-13190](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13190)\n* hcl2: add `base64gzip` function.\n      In some cases, small blobs may need to be kept in memory, and injected in\n      a template somewhere else, but if the blob needs to be minimised, the\n      base64gzip function can be invoked to compress the blob and expose it\n      as a valid HCL2 string for use later.\n      [GH-13142](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13142)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n\n* hcl2: Fix duplicate error messages on top-level HCL violations.\n      A parsing quirk for HCL templates caused Packer to produce the same parsing\n      error multiple times if the error was caused by a top-level violation.\n      [GH-13245](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13245)\n* build: Include LC_UUID in Darwin binaries.\n      A change in how Apple authorises a plugin to access the network caused\n      Packer to break on recent (14.7 and above) macOS versions, as Packer uses\n      the local network to communicate with plugins.\n      The fix is to include an additional UUID into the metadata of the produced\n      binary, so it is authorised by macOS to use the local network, which prompts\n      an update to the version of Go used for building Packer (1.22.9), as it is\n      when this addition is supported by an LDFLAG.\n      [GH-13214](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13214)\n* hcl2: Don't error on empty bucker slug.\n      As reported by members of our community, using a hcp_packer_registry\n      block without a bucket slug, even if provided by external means, would cause\n      Packer to fail with an invalid bucket slug error. This is most definitely\n      a bug, which is addressed in this release.\n      [GH-13210](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13210)\n* hcp: fix bug when trying to extract HEAD SHA from empty Git repo.\n      [GH-13165](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13165)\n\n### SECURITY:\n\n* Bump to go-crypto v0.31.0\n      [GH-13233](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13233)\n\n### NOTES:\n\n* docs: fix UUIDv4 example. A community user has found discrepancies in the\n      UUIDv4 examples which were used in our docs, as they do not match the\n      standard.\n      [GH-13229](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13229)\n* hcl2: fix slice initialisation method during variable evaluation phase.\n      [GH-13175](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13175)\n\n", "created_at": "2025-01-22T15:13:57Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.17.0", "tag_name": "knative-v1.17.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.17.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## Changes \r\n\r\n- Adding support for the \"hostPath\" volume type. The feature allows users to mount directories from the host node's filesystem into their Knative service containers. It enables access to local storage on the node, facilitating use cases such as accessing node-specific data or utilizing local caches. The feature is behind the flag `kubernetes.podspec-volumes-hostpath`. (#15648, @amarflybot)\r\n- Fixes previously supported probe syntax without a leading slash. (#15681, @skonto)\r\n- Fixes revision timeout defaulting when identical values are present in timeout settings. (#15617, @skonto)\r\n- A revision is now set to ContainerHealthy=True when it has ready replicas (#15503, @SaschaSchwarze0)\r\n- Add default container annotation to Pods created by the reconciler (#15694, @konstfish)\r\n- Allow explicitly setting `containers.securityContext.privileged` to `false` (#15643, @KapilSareen)\r\n- Fixes a problem in configuration reconciliation where labeler creates a different order of the route names listed via the annotation `serving.knative.dev/routes` compared to the configuration reconciler. (#15601, @skonto)\r\n- Kubernetes Deployments created for a Knative Revision are not configured with revisionHistoryLimit=0 which saves a lot of space in your Kubernetes database if you have a lot of Knative Services that are not updated while you regularly update Knative itself and pick up new queue-proxy images.

record feature and refactors and optimizes the configuration gray management to enable users to manage configuration releases and gray configurations more efficiently. It is important to note that this update may lead to certain changes in the database table structure used by Nacos, and the first startup after the upgrade may take some time for automatic data migration (this situation only applies to clusters that have used the beta gray feature in older versions).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above features, this version also includes significant optimizations and bug fixes for several other functions, including but not limited to the following:\r\n\r\n- Unified client addressing logic and provision of custom extension interfaces.\r\n- The client will automatically refresh the token when encountering a no-permission status during requests, without waiting for the token to expire.\r\n\r\nPlease see the details of the changes

This method provides data restoration in case of missing parts while optimizing storage space:\r\n\r\n - `EC8+1`: Uses 112.5% of space,\r\n - `EC4+1`: Uses 125% of space,\r\n\r\nwhile maintaining the same level of hardware failure protection as standard replication (200%).\r\n\r\n### New Options in Storage Class Definitions\r\n\r\n- **`TRASH` State**: files in the MooseFS TRASH, so the deleted files that are retained for a configurable period of time, can now have custom storage definitions within a storage class.\r\n- **`ARCHIVE` State Configuration**: `ARCHIVE` state is now fully configurable:\r\n - Set file archive times based on last `atime`, `mtime`, or `ctime`.\r\n - Choose between `FAST` archival (ASAP) or `PER CHUNK`  based on `mtime`.\r\n - Exclude files below a certain length from being archived.\r\n - **Logical Expressions in Label Definitions**: Support for comprehensive logical expressions in label definitions is now available, allowing users to create more flexible and precise rules, providing greater control over how storage classes and states are applied to files. This includes the ability to use negations.\r\n - State-Specific Label Overrides: Override label modes (`STD`, `LOOSE`, `STRICT`) for specific states: `CREATE`, `KEEP`, `ARCHIVE`, or `TRASH`.\r\n\r\n### Storage Class Based on File Patterns\r\nUsers can now assign file storage classes dynamically based on custom file name patterns, providing greater flexibility in managing data. For example, files with a `.backup` extension could be assigned to a specific storage class with lower redundancy, while files starting with `important_` might be placed in a high-redundancy class.\r\n\r\n### Broadcast Mechanism for Server Restarts\r\nServer restarts (both chunk server and master) no longer block I/O until the end of chunk registration process.\r\n\r\n### Improved Chunk Format\r\nEnhanced handling of control sums for more secure chunk storage.\r\n\r\n### New Web-based Graphical User Interface with Dark Mode\r\nAdditional monitoring charts and system insights, offering improved chart systems and more detailed information. Moreover, dark mode is now available.\r\n\r\n### Multi-LAN Configuration\r\nSupport for clients across different LANs to remain within their LAN IP class while communicating with the master server. Can be used alongside the `remap` option known from MooseFS 3.x.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced IP Remap\r\nCustomizable IP-to-IP remapping instead of just fixed remapping of leading bits in IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Daemon Info\r\nMooseFS daemons instructed by an `info` signal can now generate detailed info files in working directory, listing configuration, state, and module data for enhanced troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### CS-Master Consistency Checks\r\nNew mechanism to ensure consistency between master and chunk server data held in RAM.\r\n\r\n### New `mfshdd.cfg` Options\r\nFlags with limits and options for disks with chunks shared with other processes, allowing better calculation of available/occupied space on disks.\r\n\r\n### New Offline Tool: `mfsmetasearch`\r\nAllows offline searches for files in metadata based on various conditions such as chunk IDs, inodes, and attributes.\r\n\r\n### Updated Logging System\r\nClear division of log messages by severity levels, with customizable logging options and syslog reporting.\r\n\r\n### New ACL Handling Tools\r\nUseful for operating systems without built-in ACL management tools.\r\n\r\n### General Algorithm Improvements\r\nNumerous improvements to algorithms for faster and more efficient MooseFS performance, especially in edge-case scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Quality of Life Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Faster Metadata Loading** at master server startup.\r\n- **`mfssupervisor` Tool** for on-demand metadata saves.\r\n- **`mfsfileinfo` Tool** can now display chunk paths on chunk servers.\r\n- **Enhanced Chunk Rebalance Algorithms**.\r\n- **More Configuration Options** for various operations and storage management.\r\n\r\n## Community Contributions\r\nDuring the development of this version, we received valuable feedback and suggestions from our community, many of which have been implemented. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to shaping this release of MooseFS!\r\n\r\n\r\n## MooseFS PRO\r\nIf you are looking for high availability (HA) for master servers, improved disk space management with enhanced data protection through EC configurations with higher redundancy levels, and dedicated support, we also offer MooseFS PRO version. This version is designed for enterprise environments where uptime and data integrity are critical, providing features like automatic failover for master servers, more advanced erasure coding for greater resilience against hardware failures, and professional support services to ensure smooth operation and rapid issue resolution. MooseFS PRO adds an extra layer of reliability and optimization for those managing large-scale, mission-critical storage systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe recommend to update your MooseFS clusters to this version.\r\n\r\nThank you, \\\r\nPiotr / MooseFS Team", "created_at": "2024-09-23T10:07:48Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release v1.11.3", "tag_name": "v1.11.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/releases/tag/v1.11.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery", "body": "## Release date: 2024\u5e7408\u670824\u65e5\r\n\r\n\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4: https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/compare/v1.11.2...v1.11.3\r\n\u8d21\u732e\u8005: @hhyo\r\n\r\n- \u4fee\u590d\u5f00\u542f\u81ea\u52a8\u5ba1\u6279\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u9a73\u56de\u9519\u8bef\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u95ee\u9898 @hhyo (#2772)\r\n- \u56de\u9000\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u524d\u7aef\u8c03\u6574 @hhyo (#2771)\r\n\r\n## \u5347\u7ea7\u6b65\u9aa4\r\n- https://github.com/hhyo/archery/wiki/upgrade\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-24T09:27:47Z", "project": "Archery", "repo": "hhyo/Archery", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3006.9", "tag_name": "v3006.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases/tag/v3006.9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt", "body": "# Welcome to Salt v3006.9\n\n| :exclamation: ATTENTION                                                                                                  |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The archives generated by GitHub(`Source code(zip)`, `Source code(tar.gz)`) will not report Salt's version properly.     |\n| Please use the tarball generated by The Salt Project Team(`salt-3006.9.tar.gz`).", "created_at": "2024-07-30T17:35:53Z", "project": "SaltStack", "repo": "saltstack/salt", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "libcni v1.2.3", "tag_name": "v1.2.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/releases/tag/v1.2.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containernetworking/cni", "body": "This is a minor release to correct a divergence between the specification and libcni.
