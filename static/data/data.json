Thanks to @toanju for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3672).\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add ability to show custom dashboards at vmui by specifying a path to a directory with dashboard config files via `-vmui.customDashboardsPath` command-line flag. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3322) and [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/vmui/packages/vmui/public/dashboards).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): apply the `step` globally to all the displayed graphs. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3574).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve the appearance of graph lines by using more visually distinct colors. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3571).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: do not slow down concurrently executed queries during assisted merges, since assisted merges already prioritize data ingestion over queries. The probability of assisted merges has been increased starting from [v1.85.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1850) because of internal refactoring. This could result in slowed down queries when there is a plenty of free CPU resources. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3647) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3641) issues.\r\n* BUGFIX: reduce the increased CPU usage at `vmselect` to v1.85.3 level when processing heavy queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3641).\r\n* BUGFIX: [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention-filters): fix `FATAL: cannot locate metric name for metricID=...: EOF` panic, which could occur when retention filters are enabled.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly cancel in-flight service discovery requests for [consul_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#consul_sd_configs) and [nomad_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#nomad_sd_configs) when the service list changes. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3468).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): [dockerswarm_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#dockerswarm_sd_configs): apply `filters` only to objects of the specified `role`. Previously filters were applied to all the objects, which could cause errors when different types of objects were used with filters that were not compatible with them. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3579).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): suppress all the scrape errors when `-promscrape.suppressScrapeErrors` is enabled. Previously some scrape errors were logged even if `-promscrape.suppressScrapeErrors` flag was set.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): consistently put the scrape url with scrape target labels to all error logs for failed scrapes. Previously some failed scrapes were logged without this information.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not send stale markers to remote storage for series exceeding the configured [series limit](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3660).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly apply [series limit](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter) when [staleness tracking](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) is disabled.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): reduce memory usage spikes when big number of scrape targets disappear at once. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3668). Thanks to @lzfhust for [the initial fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3669).\r\n* BUGFIX: [Pushgateway import](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format): properly return `200 OK` HTTP response code. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3636).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly parse `M` and `Mi` suffixes as `1e6` multipliers in `1M` and `1Mi` numeric constants. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3664).

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\nErlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)\r\nacross all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.10.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `direct_exchange_routing_v2` feature flag could sometimes fail to enable on freshly started nodes.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6847](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6847)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Improvements to the feature flag subsystem.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#6682](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6682), [#6791](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6791), [#6832](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6832)\r\n\r\n * Preserve additional information in the log message when heartbeat frame cannot\r\n   be sent due to a TCP timeout.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6708](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6708)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmqctl add_vhost` now coerces a single string value of `--tags` into an array.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6877](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6877)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stream Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Core server did not correctly translate empty stream message bodies to AMQP 0-9-1 when a stream was\r\n   consumed by an AMQP 0-9-1 (as opposed to RabbitMQ Stream protocol) client.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6835](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6835)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web STOMP Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `ERROR` frames delivery is now correctly delivered w.r.t. TCP connection closure for clients that run into\r\n   certain types of exceptions.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @csicar.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6789](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6789)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * `prometheus.erl` was upgraded [from `4.9.1` to `4.10.0`](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus.erl/tags)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named

Using `--strict-builtin-errors` would allow finding the first error encountered during evaluation, but terminates execution immediately.\r\n\r\nTo improve the debugging experience, it is now possible to display *all* of the errors encountered during normal evaluation of a policy, via the new `--show-builtin-errors` option.\r\n\r\nConsider the following error-filled policy, `multi-error.rego`:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage play\r\n\r\nthis_errors(number) := result {\r\n        result := number / 0\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis_errors_too(number) := result {\r\n        result := number / 0\r\n}\r\n\r\nres1 := this_errors(1)\r\n\r\nres2 := this_errors_too(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `--strict-builtin-errors`, we would only see the first divide by zero error:\r\n\r\n    opa eval --strict-builtin-errors -d multi-error.rego data.play\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 error occurred: multi-error.rego:4: eval_builtin_error: div: divide by zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `--show-builtin-errors` shows both divide by zero issues though:\r\n\r\n    opa eval --show-builtin-errors -d multi-error.rego data.play -f pretty\r\n\r\n```\r\n2 errors occurred:\r\nmulti-error.rego:4: eval_builtin_error: div: divide by zero\r\nmulti-error.rego:8: eval_builtin_error: div: divide by zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy showing more errors up front, we hope this will improve the overall policy writing experience.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Function: `time.format`\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to format a time value from nanoseconds to a formatted timestamp string via a built-in function. The builtin accepts 3 argument formats, each allowing for different options:\r\n\r\n 1. A number representing the nanoseconds since the epoch (UTC).\r\n 2. A two-element array of the nanoseconds, and a timezone string.\r\n 3. A three-element array of nanoseconds, timezone string, and a layout string (same format as for `time.parse_ns`).\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.48.0/policy-reference/#builtin-time-timeformat) for all details.\r\n\r\nImplemented by @burnerlee.\r\n\r\n### Optimization in rule indexing\r\n\r\nPreviously, every time the evaluator looked up a rule in the index, OPA performed checks for grounded refs over the entire index *before* looking up the rule.\r\n\r\nNow, OPA performs all groundedness checks once at index construction time, which keeps index lookup times much more consistent as the number of indexed rules scales up.\r\n\r\nPolicies with large numbers of index-ready rules can expect a small performance lift, proportional to the number of indexed rules.\r\n\r\n### Bundle fetching with AWS Signing Version 4A\r\n\r\nAWS has recently developed an extension to SigV4 called Signature Version 4A (SigV4A) which enables signatures that are valid in more than one AWS Region. This new signature method is required for signing multi-region API requests, such as Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points (MRAP).\r\n\r\nOPA now supports this new request signing method for bundle fetching, which means that you can use an S3 MRAP as a bundle source. This is configured via the new `services[<your_service_name>].credentials.s3_signing.signature_version` field.\r\n\r\nSee the [the documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.48.0/configuration/#aws-signature) for more details.\r\n\r\nImplemented by @jwineinger\r\n\r\n### Runtime\r\n\r\n- rego: Check store modules before skipping parsing (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- topdown/rego: Add BuiltinErrorList support to rego package, add to eval command (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- topdown: Fix evaluator's re-wrapping of `NDBCache` errors (authored by @srenatus)\r\n- Fix potential memory leak from `http.send` in interquery cache (authored by @asleire)\r\n- ast/parser: Detect function rule head + `contains` keyword ([#5525](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5525)) authored and reported by @philipaconrad\r\n- ast/visit: Add `SomeDecl` to visitor walks ([#5480](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5480)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- ast/visit: Include `LazyObject` in visitor walks ([#5479](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5479)) authored by @srenatus reported by @benweint\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- topdown: cache undefined rule evaluations ([#593](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/593)) authored by @edpaget reported by @tsdandall\r\n- topdown: Specify host verification policy for http redirects ([#5388](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5388)) authored and reported by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- providers/aws: Refactor + Fix 2x Authorization header append issue ([#5472](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5472)) authored by @philipaconrad reported by @Hiieu\r\n- Add support to enable ND builtin cache via discovery ([#5457](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5457)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar reported by @asadali\r\n- format: Only use ref heads for all rule heads if necessary ([#5449](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5449)) authored and reported by @srenatus\r\n- `opa inspect`: Fix path of data namespaces on windows (authored by @shm12)\r\n- ast+cmd: Only enforcing `schemas` annotations if `--schema` flag is used (authored by @johanfylling)\r\n- sdk: Allow use of a query tracer (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- sdk: Allow use of metrics, profilers, and instrumentation (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- sdk: Return provenance information in Result types (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- sdk: Allow use of StrictBuiltinErrors (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Allow print calls in IR (authored by @anderseknert)\r\n- tester/runner: Fix panic'ing case in utility function ([#5496](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5496)) authored and reported by @philipaconrad\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n- Community page updates (authored by @anderseknert)\r\n- Update Hugo version, update deprecated Page fields (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- docs: Update TLS-based Authentication Example ([#5521](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5521)) authored by @charlieegan3 reported by @jjthom87\r\n- docs: Update opa eval flags to link to bundle docs (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- docs: Make SDK first option for Go integraton (authored by @anderseknert)\r\n- docs: Fix typo on Policy Language page.

Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- [Kubernetes 1.25 Support](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/important-notes/#pod-security-policies-disabled--pod-security-admission-introduction)\r\n  In the previous versions, Longhorn relies on Pod Security Policy (PSP) to authorize Longhorn components for privileged operations. From Kubernetes 1.25, PSP has been removed and replaced with Pod Security Admission (PSA). Longhorn v1.4.0 supports opt-in PSP enablement, so it can support Kubernetes versions with or without PSP.\r\n\r\n- [ARM64 GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4206)\r\n  ARM64 has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0. After receiving more user feedback and increasing testing coverage, ARM64 distribution has been stabilized with quality as per our regular regression testing, so it is qualified for general availability.\r\n\r\n- [RWX GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220727-dedicated-recovery-backend-for-rwx-volume-nfs-server.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/)\r\n  RWX has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0, but it lacks availability support when the Longhorn Share Manager component behind becomes unavailable. Longhorn v1.4.0 supports NFS recovery backend based on Kubernetes built-in resource, ConfigMap, for recovering NFS client connection during the fail-over period. Also, the NFS client hard mode introduction will further avoid previous potential data loss. For the detail, please check the issue and enhancement proposal.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Snapshot Checksum](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  Data integrity is a continuous effort for Longhorn. In this version, Snapshot Checksum has been introduced w/ some settings to allow users to enable or disable checksum calculation with different modes.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Bit-rot Protection](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will periodically calculate and check the checksums of volume snapshots, find corrupted snapshots, then fix them.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Replica Rebuilding Speedup](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will use the calculated snapshot checksum to avoid needless snapshot replication between nodes for improving replica rebuilding speed and resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221103-filesystem-trim.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/trim-filesystem/#trim-the-filesystem-in-a-longhorn-volume)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports UNMAP SCSI command to reclaim space from the block volume.\r\n\r\n- [Online Volume Expansion](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/expansion)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports optional parameters to pass size expansion requests when updating the volume frontend to support online volume expansion and resize the filesystem via CSI node driver.\r\n\r\n- [Local Volume via Data Locality Strict Mode](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20200819-keep-a-local-replica-to-engine.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#default-data-locality)\r\n  Local volume is based on a new Data Locality setting, Strict Local. It will allow users to create one replica volume staying in a consistent location, and the data transfer between the volume frontend and engine will be through a local socket instead of the TCP stack to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Recurring Job Backup Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20201002-allow-recurring-backup-detached-volumes.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/restore-recurring-jobs-from-a-backup/)\r\n  Recurring jobs binding to a volume can be backed up to the remote backup target together with the volume backup metadata. They can be restored back as well for a better operation experience.\r\n\r\n- [Volume IO Metrics](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/monitoring/metrics/#volume)\r\n  Longhorn enriches Volume metrics by providing real-time IO stats including IOPS, latency, and throughput of R/W IO. Users can set up a monotoning solution like Prometheus to monitor volume performance.\r\n\r\n- [Longhorn System Backup & Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220913-longhorn-system-backup-restore.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/system-backup-restore/)\r\n  Users can back up the longhorn system to the remote backup target. Afterward, it's able to restore back to an existing cluster in place or a new cluster for specific operational purposes.\r\n\r\n- [Support Bundle Enhancement](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221109-support-bundle-enhancement.md)\r\n  Longhorn introduces a new support bundle integration based on a general [support bundle kit](https://github.com/rancher/support-bundle-kit) solution. This can help us collect more complete troubleshooting info and simulate the cluster environment.\r\n\r\n- [Tunable Timeout between Engine and Replica](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#engine-to-replica-timeout)\r\n  In the current Longhorn versions, the default timeout between the Longhorn engine and replica is fixed without any exposed user settings. This will potentially bring some challenges for users having a low-spec infra environment. By exporting the setting configurable, it will allow users adaptively tune the stability of volume operations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before installing Longhorn v1.4.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher App Marketplace, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before upgrading to Longhorn v1.4.0 from v1.3.x. Only support upgrading from 1.3.x.**\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Pod Security Policy is an opt-in setting. If installing Longhorn with PSP support, need to enable it first.\r\n- The built-in CSI Snapshotter sidecar is upgraded to v5.0.1. The v1beta1 version of Volume Snapshot custom resource is deprecated but still supported. However, it will be removed after upgrading CSI Snapshotter to 6.1 or later versions in the future, so please start using v1 version instead before the deprecated version is removed.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues after Release\r\n\r\nPlease follow up on [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Outstanding-Known-Issues-of-Releases) about any outstanding issues found after this release.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Reclaim/Shrink space of volume ([836](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836)) - @yangchiu @derekbit @smallteeths @shuo-wu\r\n- [FEATURE] Backup/Restore Longhorn System ([1455](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455)) - @c3y1huang @khushboo-rancher\r\n- [FEATURE] Online volume expansion ([1674](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674)) - @shuo-wu @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Record recurring schedule in the backups and allow user choose to use it for the restored volume ([2227](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227)) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [FEATURE] NFS support (RWX) GA ([2293](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Support metrics for Volume IOPS, throughput and latency real time ([2406](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Support bundle enhancement ([2759](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Automatic identifying of corrupted replica (bit rot detection) ([3198](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Local volume for distributed data workloads ([3957](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Support K8s 1.25 by updating removed deprecated resource versions like PodSecurityPolicy ([4003](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Faster resync time for fresh replica rebuilding ([4092](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4092)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Introduce checksum for snapshots ([4210](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Update K8s version support and component/pkg/build dependencies ([4239](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4239)) - @yangchiu @PhanLe1010\r\n- [BUG] data corruption due to COW and block size not being aligned during rebuilding replicas  ([4354](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4354)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT]  Adjust the iSCSI timeout and the engine-to-replica timeout settings ([4491](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Using specific block size in Longhorn volume's filesystem ([4594](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4594)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Speed up replica rebuilding by the metadata such as ctime of snapshot disk files ([4783](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Configure successfulJobsHistoryLimit of CronJobs ([1711](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1711)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Allow customization of the cipher used by cryptsetup in volume encryption ([3353](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3353)) - @mantissahz @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] New setting to limit the concurrent volume restoring from backup ([4558](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4558)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Make FS format options configurable in storage class ([4642](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4642)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n\r\n## Improvement\r\n\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Change the script into a docker run command mentioned in 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc ([1521](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1521)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Improve 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc.

(#13259, @psschwei)\r\n- Upgrade HorizontalPodAutoscaler to autoscaling/v2 API version (#13337, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Services may now set `seccompProfile` in SecurityContext to allow users to comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standards best-practice (#13401, @evankanderson)\r\n- Bump min-version to k8s 1.23, so removing kind 1.22 testing (#13357, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Increase the outbound context deadline in reconcilers to 30s (from 10s) to match the maximum K8s webhook timeout. (#13323, @mattmoor)\r\n \r\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n- Add timeout handling in Activator  when processing a request for a revision (#13261, @nader-ziada)\r\n- EmptyDir volumes feature flag is now enabled by default (#13405, @dprotaso)\r\n- Save data from perf tests to create a dashboard. (#13192, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\n### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Knative services can now specify securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation (#13395, @mattmoor)\r\n- ConfigMap config-defaults property `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` now defaults to `revision-timeout-seconds`. This should unblock upgrades who set `revision-timeout-seconds` lower than the default value of 300 (#13255, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix LatestReadyRevision semantics so it only advances forward. When a Revision fails the Configuration & Route will no longer fall back to older revision. The exception is when you rollback to a Revision that is explicitly named.

"https://github.com/Netflix/eureka", "body": "# Eureka 2.0.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nEureka 2.0.0 has been released. This release is a new effort and is not related to a previous preview of code released in the [2.x-archive](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/2.x-archive) branch which was an experimental re-architecture of Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Server HTTP API and wire data formats *have not changed* for the 2.0.0 release. Eureka servers and clients should be backwards and forwards compatible over the wire. This release was primarily driven for compatibility with [Spring Framework 6.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga) and [Spring Boot 3.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/24/spring-boot-3-0-goes-ga) and the change to [Jakarta EE 9](https://jakarta.ee/release/9/).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\nThe Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API is not backwards compatible with 1.x.\r\nEureka 1.x included support for Jersey 1 and optional Support for Jersey 2. In many cases, Jersey 1 was the default and was baked into the `eureka-core` and `eureka-client` modules. Having a default client has been removed. The new `eureka-client-jersey3` and `eureka-core-jersey3` should now be used if no other implementation is provided (such as Spring Cloud support for a `RestTemplate` implementation).\r\nThe [`DiscoveryClient constructors`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/b03151940fe2a647bb0697bb0c6f1057f4db46e8/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java#L236-L279) have been updated to have a new required [`TransportClientFactories`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/2.x/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/shared/transport/jersey/TransportClientFactories.java) parameter. The majority of the Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API has remained unchanged.\r\nAll references to `javax.*` classes have been changed to `jakarta.*` classes and the appropriate modules have been added.\r\nThe `eureka-server-governator` module was removed. There is no current support for the JakartaEE version of `@Inject`.\r\nThe `eureka-server` module currently does not build a functional WAR file. The recommended way of creating a Eureka 2.0.0 server is via Spring Cloud Netflix as a Spring Boot application.\r\nThe build now requires JDK 11 because of some tests that require Jetty and the version of Jetty that supports Jakarta EE 9 requires Java 11.

[[GH-17679](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/17679)]\r\n* core (enterprise): Supported storage check in `vault server` command will no longer prevent startup. Instead, a warning will be logged if configured to use storage backend other than `raft` or `consul`.\r\n* core/quotas (enterprise): Fix a lock contention issue that could occur and cause Vault to become unresponsive when creating, changing, or deleting lease count quotas.\r\n* core: Fix potential deadlock if barrier ciphertext is less than 4 bytes. [[GH-17944](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/17944)]\r\n* core: fix a start up race condition where performance standbys could go into a\r\n  mount loop if default policies are not yet synced from the active node.

See the Removed Legacy Features section below for details.\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Extensions\r\n\r\nRancher v2.7.0 introduces **extensions**. Admins may now make changes and enhancements to their UI functionality as desired independent of Rancher Manager releases. Using the Extensions catalog, which can be found at **\u2261 > Extensions**, the admin can view the list of installed extensions, update or roll back existing extensions, and install new extensions as desired. For more information on how to use Rancher extensions, please see the [docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions).\r\n\r\n### K3s Provisioning is GA (x86 Only)\r\n\r\nProvisioning K3s clusters on x86 clusters has graduated to GA! The fully compliant Kubernetes distribution is simplified, secure and at less than 60mb is perfect for Edge.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n- Support has ended for Kubernetes v1.20, v1.21, and v1.22.\r\n- The `Manage Cluster Members` and `Manage Project Members` roles have been updated to better align with common expectations regarding privilege escalation. Users in this role must now have any privilege they wish to assign to others. See [#122](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/pull/122).\r\n\r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- Cluster events are now displayed more prominently. See [#5816](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5816).\r\n- Added the ability to customize documentation links in the Rancher UI. See [#6294](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6294).\r\n- The Diagnostics page now shows more detailed information for troubleshooting performance issues. See [#6739](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6739).\r\n\r\n### New in Fleet\r\n\r\nAuthentication for OCI-based registries is now supported. Note that the structure of the [fleet.yaml](https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/single-cluster/helm-oci/fleet.yaml) is the same, and the credentials are provided as a Kubernetes secret which is described in the `Private Helm Repo` box in the [Repo Structure docs](https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-structure/).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- When deploying a RKE2/K3s custom cluster that uses a proxy, the registration now completes as expected. See [#39066](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39066).\r\n- When navigating to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Management page or Home page, the clusters now show up per the selected namespace as expected. See [#7213](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7213).\r\n- Kubernetes versions 1.24.x are no longer appearing as \"experimental\" when provisioning AKS clusters, as 1.24.x versions are fully supported for AKS clusters. See [#7217](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7217).\r\n- RKE v1.3.10-v1.3.13 in Rancher v2.6.7-v2.6.8 no longer removes user addons during an upgrade before redeploying them, which would cause issues with RKE1 cluster upgrades if user addons template has cattle-* or other system namespaces. See [#38749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38749).\r\n- Fixed an issue where user-defined EKS security groups were configured as the only node group security groups rather than being appended to the cluster default security group. See [#38014](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38014).\r\n- Fixed issue in which OPA Gatekeeper became stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n- Web socket disconnections no longer result in too many notifications. See [#6992](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6992).\r\n- CPU and memory usage are now displayed properly for EKS nodes. See [#4956](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4956).\r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Pods critical to running Rancher did not use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for its sidecar audit logging instead of busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. Rancher recommends admins to add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not be able to perform some of the actions within Azure AD, if the permissions are insufficient, so you may encounter errors.\r\n- For RKE2/K3s node driver clusters, when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app, the behavior has changed for pulling images. Previously, only the global container registry was used. As of this release, by default, if a private registry exists in the cluster config, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. To change the default registry, a custom registry can be specified during the Helm chart install/upgrade workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n- EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- In RKE1 clusters on Kubernetes v1.24, cadvisor `container` labels and metric series break Monitoring V2 dashboards. See [#38934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38934#issuecomment-1294585708) for a workaround and more details on the issue.\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\nSee the [Rancher v2.6.9 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.9) for previous behavior changes.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.0\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.6 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.12\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Kubernetes RKE1 1.24.x clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4; high CPU usage is also observed. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-16T16:10:32Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v4.3.1", "tag_name": "v4.3.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.3.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "body": "### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a deadlock between the `podman ps` and `podman container inspect` commands\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.23.1\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-10T14:07:02Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "REL_15_1", "html_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/c5dc80c1bc216f0e21a2f79f5e0415c2d4cfb35d", "repo_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres", "body": "Stamp 15.1.", "created_at": "2022-11-07T21:36:53Z", "project": "Postgres", "repo": "postgres/postgres", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.28.0", "tag_name": "v1.28.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.28.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

This way any functionality added to Grafana will work whether you use Tempo, Grafana Agent or the OTel Collector to generate metrics. Details in the [span metrics documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/metrics-generator/span_metrics/).\r\n* (#1556) Jsonnet users will need to specify ephemeral storage requests and limits for the metrics generator.\r\n* (#1481) Anonymous usage reporting has been added. Distributors and metrics generators will now require permissions to object storage equivalent to compactors and ingesters. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled easily.\r\n* (#1558) Deprecated metrics `tempodb_(gcs|s3|azure)_request_duration_seconds` have been removed in favor of `tempodb_backend_request_duration_seconds`.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] metrics-generator: Changed added metric label `instance` to `__metrics_gen_instance` to reduce collisions with custom dimensions.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.
