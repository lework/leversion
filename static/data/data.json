To improve the situation around debugging policies that use those built-ins, OPA now provides an opt-in system for caching the inputs and outputs of these built-ins during policy evaluation, and can include this information in decision log entries.\r\n\r\nA new top-level config key is used to enable the non-deterministic builtin caching feature, as shown below:\r\n\r\n    nd_builtin_cache: true\r\n\r\nThis data is exposed to OPA's [decision log masking system](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.45.0/management-decision-logs/#masking-sensitive-data) under the `/nd_builtin_cache` path, which allows masking or dropping sensitive values from decision logs selectively. This can be useful in situations where only some information about a non-deterministic built-in was needed, or the arguments to the built-in involved sensitive data.\r\n\r\nTo prevent unexpected decision log size growth from non-deterministic built-ins like `http.send`, the new cache information is included in decision logs on a best-effort basis. If a decision log event exceeds the `decision_logs.reporting.upload_size_limit_bytes` limit for an OPA instance, OPA will reattempt uploading it, after dropping the non-deterministic builtin cache information from the event. This behavior will trigger a log error when it happens, and will increment the `decision_logs_nd_builtin_cache_dropped` metrics counter, so that it will be possible to debug cases where the cache information is unexpectedly missing from a decision log entry.\r\n\r\n#### Decision Logging Example\r\n\r\nTo observe the change in decision logging we can run OPA in server mode with `nd_builtin_cache` enabled:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nopa run -s --set=decision_logs.console=true,nd_builtin_cache=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter sending it the query `x := rand.intn(\"a\", 15)` we should see something like the following in the decision logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{..., \"msg\":\"Decision Log\", \"nd_builtin_cache\":{\"rand.intn\":{\"[\\\"a\\\",15]\":3}}, \"query\":\"assign(x, rand.intn(\\\"a\\\", 15))\", ..., \"result\":[{\"x\":3}], ..., \"type\":\"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new information is included under the optional `nd_builtin_cache` JSON key, and shows what arguments were provided for each unique invocation of `rand.intn`, as well as what the output of that builtin call was (in this case, `3`).\r\n\r\nIf we send the query `x := rand.intn(\"a\", 15); y := rand.intn(\"b\", 150)\"` we can see how unique input arguments get recorded in the cache:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{..., \"msg\":\"Decision Log\", \"nd_builtin_cache\":{\"rand.intn\":{\"[\\\"a\\\",15]\":12,\"[\\\"b\\\",150]\":149}}, \"query\":\"assign(x, rand.intn(\\\"a\\\", 15)); assign(y, rand.intn(\\\"b\\\", 150))\", ..., \"result\":[{\"x\":12,\"y\":149}], ..., \"type\":\"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this information, it's now easier to debug exactly why a particular rule is used or why a rule fails when non-deterministic builtins are used in a policy.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Function: `regex.replace`\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new builtin for regex-based search/replace on strings: `regex.replace`.\r\n\r\nSee [the built-in functions docs for all the details](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.45.0/policy-reference/#builtin-regex-regexreplace)\r\n\r\nThis implementation fixes [#5162](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5162) and was authored by @boranx.\r\n\r\n### `object.union_n` Optimization\r\n\r\nThe `object.union_n` builtin allows easily merging together an array of Objects.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as noted in [#4985](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4985) its implementation generated unnecessary intermediate copies from doing pairwise, recursive Object merges. These pairwise merges resulted in poor performance for large inputs; in many cases worse than writing the equivalent operation in pure Rego.\r\n\r\nThis release changes the `object.union_n` builtin's implementation to use a more efficient merge algorithm that respects the original implementation's sequential, left-to-right merging semantics. The `object.union_n` builtin now provides a 2-3x improvement in speed and memory efficiency over the pure Rego equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK, and Runtime\r\n\r\n- cli: Fix doubled CLI hints/errors.

Add an option \"add_inheritable_capabilities\" which adds added capabilities to the inheritable list as well. As of CRI-O 1.24.0, CRI-O drops the inheritable capabilities to fix CVE-2022-27652 . However, this can cause regressions in workloads that attempt to pass capabilities to non-root users through inheritable capabilities. (#6236, @haircommander)\n - Allow `crio.runtime.runtimes` configuration to be updated on reload. (#6248, @elezar)\n - Allow for a reload to add additional runtimes and change the default runtime (#6056, @elezar)\n - CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. (#5683, @haircommander)\n\n#### Bug or Regression\n - Fix a bug where `conmon_cgroup` and `monitor_path` became out of sync (#6255, @haircommander)\n - Fix a bug where static pods cannot be created because they've already been created. (#6123, @haircommander)\n - Fix a bug where updating `default_runtime` would cause the `runc` entry in the runtimes table to be deleted (#6257, @haircommander)\n\n#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)\n - Fix some inconsistencies in the help text (#6217, @haircommander)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Added\n_Nothing has changed._\n\n### Changed\n_Nothing has changed._\n\n### Removed\n_Nothing has changed._\n", "created_at": "2022-10-07T15:21:08Z", "project": "cri-o", "repo": "cri-o/cri-o", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.10.3", "tag_name": "v1.10.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rook/rook/releases/tag/v1.10.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rook/rook", "body": "# Improvements\r\nRook v1.10.3 is a patch release limited in scope and focusing on feature additions and bug fixes to the Ceph operator.\r\n\r\n- helm: Remove memory limits from osd prepare job to prevent provisioning failure of large disks (#11109 #11103, @travisn)\r\n- nfs: Fix nfs grace period when multus is enabled (#11110, @BlaineEXE)\r\n- mgr: Set the public dashboard port differently from the target port (#11104, @travisn)\r\n- csi: Default to ceph-csi v3.7.1 for csi driver deployment (#11083, @humblec)\r\n- docs: Update troubleshoot docs and add krew uses (#11017, @subhamkrai)\r\n- docs: Explain specific nixos configurations (#11029, @yajo)\r\n- rgw: Handle insecure flag skip for obc in the tls config (#11018, @thotz)\r\n- osd: Use 256 as cryptographicLength for keys using kmip kms (#11079, @Rakshith-R)\r\n- csi: Update sidecars to latest in CSI deployment (#11085, @humblec)\r\n- operator: Customizable imagePullPolicy for csi driver and ceph pods (#10966, @avanthakkar)\r\n- examples: CephBlockPool should not have spec.annotations (#11071, @nixpanic)\r\n- osd: Clarify lv is not picked by filters (#11069, @satoru-takeuchi)\r\n", "created_at": "2022-10-06T20:56:13Z", "project": "Rook", "repo": "rook/rook", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.28.1", "tag_name": "v0.28.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.28.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- [#5702](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5702) Store: Upgrade minio-go/v7 to fix panic caused by leaked goroutines.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/compare/v0.28.0...v0.28.1", "created_at": "2022-10-06T18:04:09Z", "project": "Thanos", "repo": "thanos-io/thanos", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/commit/2aa7e66bdb526e25f59883952d74dad7ea9a014e", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad", "body": "Generate files for 1.4.1 release", "created_at": "2022-10-06T17:45:58Z", "project": "Nomad", "repo": "hashicorp/nomad", "type": "Orchestration", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "v1.3.2", "tag_name": "v1.3.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.3.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform", "body": "## 1.3.2 (October 06, 2022)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* Fixed a crash caused by Terraform incorrectly re-registering output value preconditions during the apply phase (rather than just reusing the already-planned checks from the plan phase).

reach the MySQL instance of a vttablet, it was never able to read discover that tablet again.\r\nThis problem could be resolved by restarting the VTOrc so that it discovers all the tablets again, but in a kubernetes cluster where the pods are eviced \r\nfrequently, this posed a greater challenge, since some pods when evicted and rescheduled on a different node, would sometimes fail to be discovered by VTOrc.\r\nThis has problem has been addressed in this patch by the fix https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/10662.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be

did not store a prior encryption key, and a bug\n  prior to 0.11.0 meant that auth rotations could happen more frequently than\n  expected. This could cause some race issues around rotation time. However,\n  there was another issue where a past worker authentication record could be\n  looked up for some operations instead of the current one, made more likely by\n  the too-frequent rotations. In 0.11.0 we attempt to ensure that the record\n  that remains on upgrade is the most current one, but it is possible that the\n  wrong one is chosen, leading to a failure for the worker to authenticate or\n  for some operations to consistently fail. In this case, the worker will need\n  to be deleted and re-authorized. We apologize for any issues this causes and\n  this should be remedied going forward.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix bug preventing delete of org. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465)\n* scopes: Organizations could be prevented from being deleted if some resources\n    remained ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465))\n* workers: Authentication rotation could occur prior to the expected time\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2484))\n* workers: When looking up worker authentication records, an old record could be\n  returned instead of the new one, leading to errors for encryption or\n  decryption operations ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* vault: (HCP Boundary only): Private Vault clusters can be used with HCP Boundary by using PKI workers\n  deployed in the same network as a private cluster. Tags are used to control which PKI workers can manage private Vault\n  requests by specifying a `worker_filter` attribute when configuring a Vault credential store.\n* credentials: There is now a `json` credential type supported by `static`\n  credential stores that allows submitting a generic JSON object to Boundary for\n  use with credential brokering workflows\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2423))\n* ui: Add support for worker management\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1229))\n* ui: Add support for PKI worker registration\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1244))\n* ui: Add support for Static Credential Stores\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1193))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Password Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1205))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Key Pair Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1266))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): SSH Target creation along with injected application\n  credential support ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1027))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): Update vault credential stores to support private\n  vault access ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1318))\n* ui: Improve quick setup wizard onboarding guide resource names\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1328))\n* ui: Updates to host catalog and host set forms and \u201cLearn More\u201d links\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1342))\n* workers: Added the ability to read and reinitialize the Worker certificate\n  authority ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2312),\n  [PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2387))\n* workers: Return the worker Boundary binary version on worker list and read\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2377))\n* workers: Addition of worker graceful shutdown, triggered by an initial\n  `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2455))\n* workers: Retain one previous encryption/decryption key after authentication\n  rotation ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In 0.5.0, the `add-host-sets`, `remove-host-sets`, and `set-host-sets` actions\n  on targets were deprecated in favor of `add-host-sources`,\n  `remove-host-sources`, and `set-host-sources`. Originally these actions and\n  API calls were to be removed in 0.6, but this was delayed to give extra time\n  for clients to switch over. This has now been fully switched over. A database\n  migration will modify any grants in roles to have the new actions. This same\n  changeover has been made for `add-/remove-/set-credential-libraries` to\n  `add-/remove-/set-credential-sources`, although those actions would only be in\n  grant strings in very rare circumstances as the `-sources` actions replaced\n  the `-libraries` actions very quickly.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2393))\n\n", "created_at": "2022-09-27T13:35:44Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.4.1", "tag_name": "v2.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.4.1 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis release introduces several new features, enhancements, bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix: mark 2.4.1 not as pre-release version https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/3679", "created_at": "2022-09-27T13:11:45Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Knative Serving release v1.7.2", "tag_name": "knative-v1.7.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.7.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## Changes\n\n### \ud83d\udea8  Notable\n\nPrior `RevisionSpec.TimeoutSeconds` would cause a request to timeout if the user container returned no response in the allotted time. This would allow for apps to return some data and then remain open forever indefinitely. This prior behaviour was not conformant to the Knative Serving API specification.\n\nIn this release we've fixed this behaviour and provided additional knobs to allow users greater control of various timings.\n\n- Revision timeouts now has three knobs for users to control (#12970, @nader-ziada)\n  - `TimeoutSeconds` represents the max duration a request can take\n  - `ResponseStartTimeoutSeconds` is the timeout allowed before a request starts responding\n  - `IdleTimeoutSeconds` is the max duration a request can remain open without getting any data. \n\n\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\n\n\n- Adds a `autoscaling.knative.dev/activation-scale` annotation that allows the user to set a minimum number of replicas when not scaled to zero. Note that the initial target scale for a revision is still handled by `initial-scale`; `activation-scale` will only apply on subsequent scales from zero. (#13161, @psschwei)\n\n### \ud83d\udc1eBug Fixes\n- Allow upgrades if you `revision-timeout-seconds` in the ConfigMap `config-defaults` is configured below `300` (@dprotaso)\n- Readiness probes no longer fail if the user container is restarted (due to a liveness probe failure) (#13229, @dprotaso)\n\n### \ud83e\uddf9 Cleanup\n- Building Knative Serving requires go v1.18 (#13169, @psschwei)\n- Build commit SHA is no longer under kodata in our containers it is now embedded in the binary since we build with go1.18. Use `go version -m [binary]` to get the same information (#13130, @dprotaso)\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Added\n_Nothing has changed._\n\n### Changed\n- golang.org/x/sync: 036812b \u2192 886fb93\n- k8s.io/api: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/apimachinery: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/apiserver: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/client-go: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/code-generator: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/component-base: v0.23.8 \u2192 v0.23.9\n- k8s.io/gengo: 4627b89 \u2192 397b4ae\n- k8s.io/klog/v2: 43cc75f \u2192 0990e81\n- knative.dev/caching: 9c3c19f \u2192 9df7bb7\n- knative.dev/control-protocol: 827b25d \u2192 f18dbde\n- knative.dev/hack: 65c463a \u2192 8d1e4cc\n- knative.dev/networking: f087178 \u2192 e51df7c\n- knative.dev/pkg: e60d250 \u2192 4a03844\n- knative.dev/reconciler-test: f05db88 \u2192 177f826\n\n### Removed\n_Nothing has changed._", "created_at": "2022-09-27T11:48:01Z", "project": "Knative", "repo": "knative/serving", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.26.1", "tag_name": "v2.26.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/tag/v2.26.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver", "body": "# \u4e00\u3001\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\r\n\r\n## 1.1 \u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f \u2708\ufe0f\r\n\r\n\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u6b65\u5feb\u901f\u5b89\u88c5 JumpServer\uff1a\r\n\r\n1. \u51c6\u5907\u4e00\u53f0 4\u68388G \uff08\u6700\u4f4e\uff09\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7684 64 \u4f4d Linux \u4e3b\u673a\uff1b\r\n2. \u4ee5 root \u7528\u6237\u6267\u884c\u5982\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\u4e00\u952e\u5b89\u88c5 JumpServer\u3002\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\ncurl -sSL https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/download/v2.26.1/quick_start.sh | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 1.2 \u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f \ud83d\udea2 \r\n\r\n[\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u88c5\u5305\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5730\u5740](https://community.fit2cloud.com/#/download/jumpserver/v2-26-1)\r\n\r\n\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u8bf7\u53c2\u8003\uff1a [\u5b8c\u6574\u6587\u6863](https://docs.jumpserver.org/) \r\n\r\n\r\n# \u4e8c\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u65e5\u5fd7\r\n\r\n## 2.1 \u529f\u80fd\u4f18\u5316 \ud83d\ude80 \r\n\r\n- perf: \u4f18\u5316 \u4e00\u4f53\u673a\u786c\u4ef6\u56fd\u5bc6\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u914d\u7f6e\u9879\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\r\n- perf: \u4f18\u5316 Web CLI \u8fde\u63a5\u8d44\u4ea7\u9875\u9762\u589e\u52a0\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3b\u9898\u914d\u8272\r\n- perf: \u4f18\u5316 \u4e0d\u663e\u793a\u4e91\u5bfc\u5165\u540c\u6b65\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5217\u8868\u7684\u52fe\u9009\u6846\r\n\r\n## 2.2 \u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d \ud83d\udc1b\r\n\r\n- fix: \u4fee\u590d Celery \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u5b9a\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u95ee\u9898\r\n- fix: \u4fee\u590d KoKo \u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\r\n- fix: \u4fee\u590d Razor Windows 2008 \u5f55\u50cf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u9000\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\r\n- fix: \u4fee\u590d \u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u9875\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\r\n- fix: \u4fee\u590d \u5168\u5c40\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u80fd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "created_at": "2022-09-27T07:47:47Z", "project": "Jumpserver", "repo": "jumpserver/jumpserver", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3005.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases/tag/v3005.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt", "body": "", "created_at": "2022-09-26T21:14:33Z", "project": "SaltStack", "repo": "saltstack/salt", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.20.0", "tag_name": "v2.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/releases/tag/v2.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray", "body": "### Deprecation / Removal\r\n- Drop Ansible support for v2.9 and v2.10 (#8925, @oomichi)\r\n- Drop support for Fedora 34 (#8967, @floryut)\r\n\r\n### Feature / Major changes\r\n\r\n- Add Rocky Linux 8 support (#8905, @oomichi)\r\n- Add Kylin Linux support.

This situation can lead to data loss. Note that this data loss only affects applications deployed through Fleet, including Longhorn. This has been fixed. Update to v2.6.8 or later to prevent potential data loss. See [#933](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/933) for more details on the fix.\r\n- Fixed an issue in which custom branding, color, and theme in Rancher Manager v2.6.7 was not correctly applied in the UI. See [#6704](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6704) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Known Issue in RKE\r\n\r\n- RKE v1.3.10-v1.3.13 in Rancher v2.6.7-v2.6.8 removes user addons during an upgrade before redeploying them. This causes issues with RKE1 cluster upgrades if user addons template has `cattle-*` or other system namespaces. See [#38749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38749) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Known Issue in GKE\r\n\r\n- Provisioning K8s 1.23+ GKE clusters with the default option of \"Container-Optimized OS with Docker\" for \"Image Type\" fails due to GKE no longer supporting Docker-based images per [GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deprecations/docker-containerd#timeline_and_milestones). Please use containerd-based images instead. See [#38743](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38743).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n> It is important to review the Install/Upgrade Notes below before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\n> In Rancher v2.6.4, the cluster-api module has been upgraded from v0.4.4 to v1.0.2 in which the apiVersion of CAPI CRDs are upgraded from `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` to `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`. This has the effect of causing rollbacks from Rancher v2.6.4 to any previous version of Rancher v2.6.x to fail because the previous version the CRDs needed to roll back are no longer available in v1beta1. To avoid this, the Rancher resource cleanup script should be run **before** the restore or rollback is attempted. This script can be found in the [rancherlabs/support-tools repo](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/rancher-cleanup) and the usage of the script can be found in [the backup-restore operator docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/). In addition, when users roll back Rancher on the same cluster using the Rancher Backup and Restore app in 2.6.4+, the [updated steps to create the Restore Custom Resource](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/#create-the-restore-custom-resource) must be followed. See also [#36803](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36803) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Security Fixes for Rancher Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis release addresses three **critical severity** security issues found in Rancher:\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where sensitive fields like passwords, API keys, and Rancher's service account token were stored as plaintext on Kubernetes objects. Any user with read access to those objects in the Kubernetes API could retrieve the plaintext version of those sensitive data. For more information, see [CVE-2021-36782](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f).\r\n\r\n- Improved the sanitization (removal) of credentials from cluster template answers. Failure to sanitize data can lead to plaintext storage and exposure of credentials, passwords, and API tokens. For more information, see [CVE-2021-36783](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8w87-58w6-hfv8).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an authorization logic flaw that allowed privilege escalation in downstream clusters through cluster role template binding (CRTB) and project role template binding (PRTB). For more information, see [CVE-2022-31247](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-6x34-89p7-95wg).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Azure Active Directory API Migration\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/authentication/azure-ad/#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n- **Limitations**\r\n  - Attempts to log in will fail after rolling back a Docker install of Rancher if the following conditions have occurred:\r\n    - Azure AD is enabled.\r\n    - Before the rollback, admins committed to the Azure AD configuration update.\r\n\r\n    This is because the Azure AD endpoints will not be rolled back if the rollback is not performed via the backup-restore operator. If you want to roll back Rancher to use the old Azure AD Graph API without using the backup-restore operator, follow this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38025#issuecomment-1213208087) to edit the AzureAD authconfig resource stored in the local cluster's database. The old Azure AD Graph API endpoints will not be rolled back on a Rancher rollback. See [#38025](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38025).\r\n- **Other**\r\n  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) now works with the Azure AD auth provider. Some Rancher setups might have had MFA enabled in Azure from before, but Rancher wasn't working with it correctly. Be aware that on upgrade, if MFA is enabled for the Azure app, Rancher will require additional verification. See [#38028](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/38028).\r\n  - Before starting the migration process or enabling Azure AD for the first time in v2.6.7+, ensure that you add the Azure app registration's permissions of type **Application** and **NOT Delegated** for Microsoft Graph. Otherwise, you may not be able to login to Azure AD. This issue will persist even after you disable/re-enable Azure AD and will require an hour wait, or manual deletion of a cache value to resolve.\r\n\r\n### Integration with Cloud Marketplaces\r\n\r\nRancher v2.6.7 introduces an integration allowing users to easily purchase support through the AWS marketplace for installation hosted on AWS/EKS. You must be running Rancher v2.6.7 or higher and have set up Rancher and it's local cluster according to the [prerequisites](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/cloud-marketplace/aws/prerequisites).\r\n\r\nFor details about the integration, refer to the [Rancher documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/cloud-marketplace/aws/) and [#37495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37495).\r\n\r\nNote: If users are using the csp-adapter and the [rancher backup-restore operator](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator), they will need to upgrade the backup-restore operator to the latest version (v2.1.3) in order to ensure that the applications work together.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n- Support for Kubernetes v1.24 added.\r\n- Support has ended for Kubernetes v1.18 and v1.19.\r\n- Increased entropy of CSRF (cross-site request forgery) token. See [#14](https://github.com/rancher/apiserver/pull/14) and [#414](https://github.com/rancher/norman/pull/414)\r\n- Starting in v2.6.0, whenever a user requests a kubeconfig file, Rancher creates a newly-generated token instead of retrieving the old one. The token TTL is not configurable on these tokens, causing token cleanup to be a manual process. We've now added a new setting to allow users to change the TTL on kubeconfig tokens called `kubeconfig-default-token-TTL-minutes`. This setting has a default value of 0 to retain default behavior between Rancher versions. Rancher recommends that admins change this setting from its default to prevent unbound token creation. Note that this setting only applies to tokens generated for kubeconfigs when `kubeconfig-generate-tokens` is true, which is the default. When `kubeconfig-generate-tokens` is false, `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` will be used for token TTL. This behavior is the same as previous versions of Rancher. The `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting is now deprecated in favor of using `kubeconfig-default-token-TTL-minutes` in the future. See [#37705](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37705).\r\n- The Rancher chart now exposes the `ingress.ingressClassName` value, which allows setting the name of the ingress controller to be used with Rancher's Ingress resource. This is relevant for Rancher clusters created with a provider other than RKE, since RKE automatically sets nginx as the ingress class name. By default, the value is an empty string because Rancher does not make assumptions about the type of ingress controller that runs in Rancher (nginx, Traefik, etc.). See [#37971](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37971).\r\n- **Behavior Changes**\r\n  - The Kubernetes team has observed an increase in memory usage with Kubernetes v1.24. See [the upstream changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#feature-1) for details.\r\n  - All Kubernetes 1.24 clusters will have cri-dockerd enabled by default which includes new and upgraded clusters. Users can apply the `io.cattle.cluster.cridockerd.enable` annotation on a cluster, and the annotation will override the default behavior. If the annotation is set to false and `enable_cri_dockerd` is set to true, the annotation will override the field/flag behavior and `enable_cri_dockerd` will be updated to false. Clusters will not provision correctly if cri-dockerd is disabled; this is expected unless a proper Docker runtime is provided. See [#38160](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38160).\r\n\r\n### New in RKE1\r\n\r\n- Resolved an issue for RKE clusters that prevented specifying more than one private registry in the YAML configuration. See [#37658](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37658).\r\n- **Windows**\r\n  - **Important**: RKE1 Support for Windows will stop on September 1st 2022 due to upstream changes. See [this article](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020684&mkt_tok=OTM3LURDSC0yNjEAAAGFmb5AA1pbloC-PZ0mHbB9sQ3Lwqcq1iax_88DXONtcnsgG5veDwnoueEmqqNdyuAdyVjjWi582ug_dSvYQto) for more details.\r\n  - A warning message has been added to inform users that Windows support is being deprecated for RKE1. See [#5995](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5995).\r\n\r\n### New in RKE2\r\n\r\n- New encryption key rotation feature added. See [the docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-admin/encryption-key-rotation/) and [#35436](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35436).\r\n- **Windows**\r\n  - HostProcess containers are now supported in Kubernetes v1.24.1 and up. See [#69](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/69).\r\n- **Behavior Changes**\r\n  - After an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.7, RKE2 provisioned clusters will briefly go into an `Updating` state with the message `waiting for plan to be applied`. This behavior is expected and has no adverse effects. See [#38353](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38353).\r\n- **Known Issues**\r\n  - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n  - Users running RHEL/CentOS 7 should not install or upgrade to K3s/RKE2 v1.24.2 or v1.24.3 but should instead wait for K3s/RKE2 v1.24.4 to do so. See [#5912](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/5912).\r\n  - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  \r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- Removed monitoring dashboard \"Rancher Internal State (Controllers)\". Most functionality from this dashboard has been replaced and can be found in the dashboard \"Rancher Performance Debugging\". See [#37274](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37274).\r\n- `ProjectHelmCharts` has been added as a selectable resource from the `helm.cattle.io` API group when creating a new project/namespace role. See [#5747](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5747).\r\n- Added a Diagnostics page to allow users to gather data from their systems to append to any issues filed for Rancher. The Diagnostics page is accessible via the About page. See [#6544](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6544).\r\n- The Deployment creation screen has been improved and a new Pod creation view has been added. See [#5734](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5734).\r\n- When viewing the details of a GitRepo through Fleet, users can now get a graphical representation of the bundle deployments that came from that GitRepo. See [#4680](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4680).\r\n- **Behavior Changes**\r\n  - Project owners and project members will no longer be able to see namespaces outside of the project(s) they have access to. This is to prevent a bad user experience, where some users could see namespaces that they could not use.\r\n  - Project owners and project members will now be required to delete namespaces within a project when deleting the project. This is to prevent a situation where they would essentially be creating orphaned namespaces, which they would lose access to when they delete the project.\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- User Preferences set by a drop-down component will now be applied correctly. Previously, updating a user preference in this manner would cause adverse effects such as the inability to view logs or the setting not taking effect. See [#5984](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5984).\r\n- Prior to `v2.6.7`, if S3 or other kinds of credentials were added to a cluster after it was already created, the reference to the secret containing the credentials was lost because the cluster status cannot be updated through the API. The references are now moved to the cluster Spec so that they can be updated after creation. To repair a cluster after a upgrade to `v2.6.7`, edit the cluster and change the etcd snapshot configuration back to local and save it, then edit again to configure S3 snapshots again. See [#38215](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38215).\r\n- Certificates with a CN exceeding 64 characters will not cause an error. See [#37766](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37766).\r\n- If the creation of the impersonation ClusterRoleBinding is interfered with or interrupted, users can now access the downstream cluster without experiencing unauthorized errors. See [#37733](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37733).\r\n- Resolved an issue where users that existed since Rancher v2.6.2 or earlier may start experiencing authorization errors upon upgrade to Rancher v2.6.5 when using kubectl with a downloaded kubeconfig for a downstream cluster. See [#37894](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37894).\r\n- Users with the role 'Cluster Owners' who are not also 'Admins' are now able to manage snapshots on RKE2 clusters. See [#37630](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37630).\r\n- A bug was found that overloaded the downstream Kubernetes API server when the Cluster Explorer dashboard is left open to a page for a downstream cluster for over 30 minutes and would start rapidly opening and closing watch requests perpetually. See [#37627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37627).\r\n- Rancher server now generates a new token every time a kubeconfig is requested via the CLI. This token is then cached by the CLI on the local system and will not cause previously created tokens to become invalid. See [#37245](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37245).\r\n- Windows installation scripts are now successfully retrieved in proxied RKE2 downstream clusters. See [#36574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36574).\r\n- The `istiod-istio-system` ValidatingWebhookConfiguration has been removed to allow Istio 1.11.x and higher to be installed in air-gapped environments. See [#35742](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35742).\r\n- Most API responses now set response headers to include `Cache-Control: no-store` which directs intermediate caches not to cache the response. Previously, some intermediate caches between the Rancher server and clients, including cluster agents, were configured to cache responses for the purpose of scalability and improved response time. In some cases this led to stale data getting inadvertently cached which would disrupt deployment of downstream clusters. See [#35199](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35199).\r\n- Project resource quotas are now correctly removed when deleted through the UI. See [#35688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35688).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Cert-Manager:**\r\n  - Rancher now supports cert-manager versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1. We recommend v1.7.x because v 1.6.x will reach end-of-life on March 30, 2022. To read more, see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#4-install-cert-manager).\r\n  - When upgrading Rancher and cert-manager, you will need to use [Option B: Reinstalling Rancher and cert-manager](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/upgrades/#option-b-reinstalling-rancher-and-cert-manager) from the Rancher docs.\r\n  - There are several versions of cert-manager which, due to their backwards incompatibility, are not recommended for use with Rancher. You can read more about which versions are affected by this issue in the [cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/). As a result, only versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1 are recommended for use at this time.\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.5 to 1.6, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.5-1.6/).\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.6 to 1.7, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.6-1.7/).\r\n- **Readiness and Liveness Check:**\r\n  - Users can now configure the `Readiness Check` and `Liveness Check` of `coredns-autoscaler`. See [#24939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24939).\r\n- **Legacy Features:**\r\n  - Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n  - When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.  See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).\r\n- **Library and Helm3-Library Catalogs:**\r\n  - Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.\r\n- **Local Cluster:**\r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Upgrading the Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and Saving Clusters:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **EKS Cluster:**\r\n  - There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System Components:**\r\n  - Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **GKE and AKS Clusters:**\r\n  - Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **Rolling Back Rancher:**\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC:**\r\n  - Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **Azure Cloud Provider for RKE2:**\r\n  - For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs. Kube Nodes:**\r\n  - In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Rancher's External IP Webhook:**\r\n  - In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Snapshot\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.8\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.6.7](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.7)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.13](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.13)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.2 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.8\r\n- v1.22.11\r\n- v1.21.14\r\n- v1.20.15\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nFeature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tUsed to enable the ability to provision RKE2 clusters. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n- RancherD was introduced as part of Rancher v2.5.4 through v2.5.10 as an experimental feature but is now deprecated. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\nThe following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring v1\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE1 - Windows:**\r\n    - OPA Gatekeeper gets stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster gets stuck in provisioning state after an upgrade to v2.6.4 and rollback to v2.6.3. See [#36859](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36859).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster has its nodes redeployed when upgrading Rancher from v2.6.3 to v2.6.4. See [#36627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36627).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/faq/networking/cni-providers/#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - OPA Gatekeeper gets stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n    - In v2.6.5, v1.21.x of RKE2 will remain experimental and [unsupported](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) for RKE2 Windows. End users should not use v1.21.x of RKE2 for any RKE2 cluster that will have Windows worker nodes. This is due to an [upstream Calico bug](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) that was not backported to the minor version of Calico (3.19.x) that is present in v1.21.x of RKE2. See [#131](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131).\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **AWS:**\r\n    - On RHEL8.4 SELinux in AWS AMI, Kubernetes v1.22 fails to provision on AWS. As Rancher will not install RPMs on the nodes, users may work around this issue either by using AMI with this package already installed, or by installing AMI via cloud-init. Users will encounter this issue on upgrade to v1.22 as well. When upgrading to 1.22, users must manually upgrade/install the rancher-selinux package on all the nodes in the cluster, then upgrade the Kubernetes version. See [#36509](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36509).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n  - **Oracle:**\r\n    - Kubernetes 1.24 clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4. See [#38214](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38214).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n    - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).\r\n    - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt.

This way any functionality added to Grafana will work whether you use Tempo, Grafana Agent or the OTel Collector to generate metrics. Details in the [span metrics documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/metrics-generator/span_metrics/).\r\n* (#1556) Jsonnet users will need to specify ephemeral storage requests and limits for the metrics generator.\r\n* (#1481) Anonymous usage reporting has been added.

Please see their respective changelogs for details on plugin\r\n    specific bug fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\n* amazon@v1.1.2 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-amazon/releases/tag/v1.1.2)\r\n* ansible@v1.0.3 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-ansible/releases/tag/v1.0.3)\r\n* azure@v1.3.0 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-azure/releases/tag/v1.3.0)\r\n* docker@v1.0.7 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-docker/releases/tag/v1.0.7)\r\n* googlecompute@v1.0.14 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-googlecompute/releases/tag/v1.0.14)\r\n* lxc@v1.0.2 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-lxc/releases/tag/v1.0.2)\r\n* triton@v1.0.2 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-triton/releases/tag/v1.0.2)\r\n* vsphere@v1.0.7 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vsphere/releases/tag/v1.0.7)\r\n* yandex@v1.1.2 - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-yandex/releases/tag/v1.1.2)\r\n\r\n\r\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\r\n* Bump packer-plugin-sdk to v0.3.1 to fix inconsistencies between `ssh_timeout`\r\n    and `ssh_handshake_attempts` configuration arguments in the SSH\r\n    communicator. [GH-11909](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11909)\r\n* core: During long running builds the HCP Packer registry will mark a build as\r\n    timed out if it has not posted an update after a certain number of minutes. For HCP\r\n    Packer enabled builds a status update will now be sent every 2 minutes to\r\n    the registry to prevent long builds from being marked as timed\r\n    out. [GH-11846](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11846)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add `component_type` configuration argument to\r\n    support specifying an exact build image when multiple images exist in the\r\n    same provider and region for a given HCP Packer bucket iteration.\r\n    [GH-11872](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11872)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add support for `channel` as input argument to\r\n    retrieve an image from the associated iteration. If\r\n    using several images from a single iteration, you may prefer sourcing an\r\n    iteration first, and referencing it for subsequent uses, as every\r\n    `hcp_packer_image` with the channel set will generate a potentially\r\n    billable HCP Packer request, but if several `hcp_packer_image`s use a\r\n    shared `hcp_packer_iteration` that will only generate one potentially\r\n    billable request.\r\n    [GH-11865](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11865)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when parsing malformed provisioner override blocks.\r\n    [GH-11881](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11881)\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when running `packer validate` on templates containing\r\n    one or more  HCP Packer data sources.\r\n    [GH-11883](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11883)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-08-02T09:55:28Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.12.10", "tag_name": "v0.12.10", "html_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.12.10", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs", "body": "### Changed\r\n\r\n- Support using `[security] LOCAL_NETWORK_ALLOWLIST = *` to allow all hostnames.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.

v0.14.1](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.1) by default.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Update error when bp order group is malformed for meta-buildpacks (#1437 by @imnitishng)\r\n* When pack is run with --verbose, it should not print registry creds (#1433 by @natalieparellano)\r\n* When platform api >= 0.9, analyzer accepts -skip-layers and -launch-cache (#1417 by @natalieparellano)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* Running `pack build` with a builder using [lifecycle 0.14.0](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.0) yields an error [\"ERROR: failed to create launch cache\"](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1467).\r\n    * Cause: https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/pull/847\r\n    * Resolutions:\r\n        * **Option 1:** Use a builder with `lifecycle` >= [0.14.1](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.1).\r\n           `pack builder inspect <builder-image>` can be used to inspect a builder image.\r\n        * **Option 2:** Use `--lifecycle-image=buildpacksio/lifecycle:0.14.1 --trust-builder=false` flags with `pack build`.\r\n            These flags would make pack use the patched version of the lifecycle for the `analyze`, `restore` and `export` phases.\r\n            [Learn more](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/concepts/trusted_builders/).\r\n\r\n##
