This matches the behavior of the Windows API when encoding to this Windows-specific character encoding.\n* `terraform init`: When interpreting the hostname portion of a provider source address or the address of a module in a module registry, Terraform will now use _non-transitional_ IDNA2008 mapping rules instead of the transitional mapping rules previously used.\n\n    This matches a change to [the WHATWG URL spec's rules for interpreting non-ASCII domain names](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii) which is being gradually adopted by web browsers. Terraform aims to follow the interpretation of hostnames used by web browsers for consistency. For some hostnames containing non-ASCII characters this may cause Terraform to now request a different \"punycode\" hostname when resolving.\n* `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))\n* The Terraform plan renderer has been completely rewritten to aid with future Terraform Cloud integration. Users should not see any material change in the plan output between 1.3 and 1.4. If you notice any significant differences, or if Terraform fails to plan successfully due to rendering problems, please open a bug report issue.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* The module installer will now record in its manifest a correct module source URL after normalization when the URL given as input contains both a query string portion and a subdirectory portion. Terraform itself doesn't currently make use of this information and so this is just a cosmetic fix to make the recorded metadata more correct. ([#31636](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31636))\n* config: The `yamldecode` function now correctly handles entirely-nil YAML documents. Previously it would incorrectly return an unknown value instead of a null value. It will now return a null value as documented. ([#32151](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32151))\n* Ensure correct ordering between data sources and the deletion of managed resource dependencies. ([#32209](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32209))\n* Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* `terraform workspace` now returns a non-zero exit when given an invalid argument ([#31318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31318))\n* Terraform would always plan changes when using a nested set attribute ([#32536](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32536))\n* Terraform can now better detect when complex optional+computed object attributes are removed from configuration ([#32551](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32551))\n* A new methodology for planning set elements can now better detect optional+computed changes within sets ([#32563](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32563))\n* Fix state locking and releasing messages when in `-json` mode, messages will now be written in JSON format ([#32451](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32451))\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* `terraform plan` can now store a plan file even when encountering errors, which can later be inspected to help identify the source of the failures ([#32395](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32395))\n* `terraform_data` is a new builtin managed resource type, which can replace the use of `null_resource`, and can store data of any type ([#31757](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31757))\n* `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))\n* Interactive input for sensitive variables is now masked in the UI ([#29520](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29520))\n* A new `-or-create` flag was added to `terraform workspace select`, to aid in creating workspaces in automated situations ([#31633](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31633))\n* A new command was added for exporting Terraform function signatures in machine-readable format: `terraform metadata functions -json` ([#32487](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32487))\n* The \"Failed to install provider\" error message now includes the reason a provider could not be installed. ([#31898](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31898))\n* backend/gcs: Add `kms_encryption_key` argument, to allow encryption of state files using Cloud KMS keys. ([#24967](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24967))\n* backend/gcs: Add `storage_custom_endpoint` argument, to allow communication with the backend via a Private Service Connect endpoint. ([#28856](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28856))\n* backend/gcs: Update documentation for usage of `gcs` with `terraform_remote_state` ([#32065](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32065))\n* backend/gcs: Update storage package to v1.28.0 ([#29656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29656))\n* When removing a workspace from the `cloud` backend `terraform workspace delete` will use Terraform Cloud's [Safe Delete](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#safe-delete-a-workspace) API if the `-force` flag is not provided. ([#31949](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/31949))\n* backend/oss: More robustly handle endpoint retrieval error ([#32295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32295))\n* local-exec provisioner: Added `quiet` argument. If `quiet` is set to `true`, Terraform will not print the entire command to stdout during plan. ([#32116](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32116))\n* backend/http: Add support for mTLS authentication. ([#31699](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31699))\n* cloud: Add support for using the [generic hostname](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/using#generic-hostname-terraform-enterprise) localterraform.com in module and provider sources as a substitute for the currently configured cloud backend hostname. This enhancement was also applied to the remote backend.\n* `terraform show` will now print an explanation when called on a Terraform workspace with empty state detailing why no resources are shown. ([#32629](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32629))\n* backend/gcs: Added support for `GOOGLE_BACKEND_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` env var to allow impersonating a different service account when `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is configured for the GCP provider. ([#32557](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32557))\n* backend/cos: Add support for the `assume_role` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.\n* backend/cos: Add support for the `security_token` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.\n\nEXPERIMENTS:\n\n* Since its introduction the `yamlencode` function's documentation carried a warning that it was experimental. This predated our more formalized idea of language experiments and so wasn't guarded by an explicit opt-in, but the intention was to allow for small adjustments to its behavior if we learned it was producing invalid YAML in some cases, due to the relative complexity of the YAML specification.\n\n    From Terraform v1.4 onwards, `yamlencode` is no longer documented as experimental and is now subject to the Terraform v1.x Compatibility Promises. There are no changes to its previous behavior in v1.3 and so no special action is required when upgrading.\n\n", "created_at": "2023-03-08T18:03:30Z", "project": "Terraform", "repo": "hashicorp/terraform", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.21.3", "tag_name": "v0.21.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.21.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/coreos/flannel", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* documentation: use latest release by @laverya in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1723\r\n* fix randomness in k3s end to end tests by @thomasferrandiz in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1729\r\n* Bump golang.org/x/net from 0.4.0 to 0.7.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1727\r\n* Removed component from kustomzation manifest process by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1732\r\n* Fix etcd index outofrange by @thomasferrandiz in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1726\r\n* Reordered iptables rules by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1725\r\n* Added MTU config for vxlan and wireguard by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1736\r\n* Add helm chart  to deploy flannel by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1733\r\n* Added CNI plugins reference and removed older build docs by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1737\r\n* Update Flannel to v0.21.3 by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1738\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @laverya made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1723\r\n* @dependabot made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1727\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/compare/v0.21.2...v0.21.3", "created_at": "2023-03-08T15:21:32Z", "project": "Flannel", "repo": "coreos/flannel", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "6.2.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/commit/3caeb8ee1bef35036655ed12c198fd6adb4795d6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

In `8.0.12` only a small number of operations were eligible for `INSTANT`, but MySQL `8.0.29` added support for more common cases.\r\nUnfortunately, the changes in `8.0.29` affect XtraBackup as follows: if you `ALTER TABLE` in MySQL `8.0.29`, and that `ALTER` is eligible for `INSTANT` DDL (e.g. add new table column), then as of that moment, XtraBackup is unable to backup that table, hence your entire database.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that even if you then upgrade your MySQL server to, e.g. `8.0.32`, the table still cannot be backed up.\r\n\r\nVersions where XtraBackup is unable to backup such tables: MySQL `8.0.29` - `8.0.31`. This does not apply to Percona Server flavor.\r\n\r\nThe issue is resolved with Percona XtraBackup `8.0.32` combined with MySQL `8.0.32`.\r\n\r\nYou might be affected if:\r\n\r\n- You're using MySQL `8.0.29` - `8.0.31` and are using XtraBackup to backup your database\r\n- and, you have issued an `ALTER TABLE`, either directly, or using Online DDL in vitess `v16.0` and below\r\n\r\nA future Vitess patch release `v16.0.1` will address the issue via Online DDL migrations.\r\n\r\n#### Mitigations\r\n\r\n- Use Percona XtraBackup `8.0.32` combined with MySQL `8.0.32`. To go with this option, you can use the docker image `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql-8.0.32`.\r\n- or, Use a Percona Server flavor\r\n- or, always ensure to add `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` or `ALGORITHM=COPY` to your `ALTER TABLE` statements\r\n\r\n#### Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have already been affected, these are the options to be able to backup your database:\r\n\r\n- Use `builtin` backups, see https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/. `builtin` backups are not based on XtraBackup.\r\n- Upgrade to MySQL `8.0.32` or above and to Xtrabackup `8.0.32`, or switch to Percona Server. To go with this option, you can use the docker image `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql-8.0.32`. Then rebuild the table directly via:\r\n  - `OPTIMIZE TABLE your_table`\r\n  - or, `ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB`\r\n- Upgrade to Vitess patch release `v16.0.1`, upgrade to MySQL `8.0.32` or above and to Xtrabackup `8.0.32`, or switch to Percona Server, and rebuild the table via Online DDL:\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctldclient ApplySchema --skip_preflight --ddl_strategy \"vitess\" --sql \"ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB\" your_keyspace\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```sql\r\n> SET @@ddl_strategy='vitess';\r\n> ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"major-changes\"/>Major Changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"advertised-mysql-version\"/>VTGate Advertised MySQL Version\r\n\r\nSince [Pull Request #11989](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11989), VTGate advertises MySQL version 8.0.30. This is a breaking change for clients that rely on the VTGate advertised MySQL version and still use MySQL 5.7.\r\nThe users can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the correct version.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"default-mysql-version\"/>Default MySQL version on Docker\r\n\r\nThe default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `5.7` to `8.0`. Additionally, the patch version of MySQL80 has been upgraded from `8.0.23` to `8.0.30`.\r\nThis change was brought by [Pull Request #12252](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12252).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"upgrading-to-this-release-with-vitess-operator\"/>\u26a0\ufe0fUpgrading to this release with vitess-operator\r\n\r\nIf you are using the vitess-operator and want to remain on MySQL 5.7, **you are required** to use the `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql57` Docker Image, otherwise the `vitess/lite:v16.0.0` image will be on MySQL 80.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are running MySQL 8.0 on the vitess-operator, with for instance `vitess/lite:v15.0.2-mysql80`, considering that we are bumping the patch version of MySQL 80 from `8.0.23` to `8.0.30`, you will have to manually upgrade:\r\n\r\n1.

The UI is removed, so this flag is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nThe following deprecated flags have also been removed:\r\n- `--enable_realtime_stats`\r\n- `--enable_vtctld_ui`\r\n- `--web_dir`\r\n- `--web_dir2`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_init`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_use_election`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_disable`\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"mysqlctl-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>MySQLCtld\r\n\r\nThe [`mysqlctl` command-line client](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/programs/mysqlctl/) had some leftover (ignored) server flags after the [v15 pflag work](https://github.com/vitessio/enhancements/blob/main/veps/vep-4.md). Those unused flags have now been removed. If you are using any of the following flags with `mysqlctl` in your scripts or other tooling, they will need to be removed prior to upgrading to v16:\r\n`--port --grpc_auth_static_client_creds --grpc_compression --grpc_initial_conn_window_size --grpc_initial_window_size --grpc_keepalive_time --grpc_keepalive_timeout`\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vttablet-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTTablet\r\n\r\nThe following flags were removed in v16:\r\n- `--enable_semi_sync`\r\n- `--backup_storage_hook`, use one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n- `--init_populate_metadata`, since we have deleted the `local_metadata` and `shard_metadata` sidecar database tables.\r\n\r\nThe flag `--disable-replication-manager` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vtbackup-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTBackup\r\n\r\nThe VTBackup flag `--backup_storage_hook` has been removed, use one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vtorc-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTOrc\r\n\r\nThe flag `--lock-shard-timeout` has been deprecated. Please use the newly introduced `--lock-timeout` flag instead. More detail [here](#lock-timeout-introduction).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"lock-timeout-introduction\"/>`lock-timeout` and `remote_operation_timeout` Changes\r\n\r\nBefore the changes made in [Pull Request #11881](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11881), the shard and keyspace locks used to be capped by the `remote_operation_timeout`. This is no longer the case and instead a new flag called `lock-timeout` is introduced.\r\nFor backward compatibility, if `lock-timeout` is unspecified and `remote_operation_timeout` flag is provided, then its value will also be used for `lock-timeout`.\r\nThe default value for `remote_operation_timeout` has also changed from 30 seconds to 15 seconds. The default for the new flag `lock-timeout` is 45 seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring upgrades, if the users want to preserve the same behaviour as previous releases, then they should provide the `remote_operation_timeout` flag explicitly before upgrading.\r\nAfter the upgrade, they should then alter their configuration to also specify `lock-timeout` explicitly.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"orc-integration-removal\"/>Orchestrator Integration Deletion\r\n\r\nOrchestrator integration in `vttablet` was deprecated in the previous release and is deleted in this release.\r\n`VTOrc` should be deployed instead. You can read more on [how VTOrc is designed](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vtorc/) and on [how to run VTOrc in production](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/user-guides/configuration-basic/vtorc/).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtcltd-ui-removal\"/>vtctld web UI Removal\r\nIn v13, the vtctld UI was deprecated. As of this release, the `web/vtctld2` directory is deleted and the UI will no longer be included in any Vitess images going forward. All build scripts and the Makefile have been updated to reflect this change, which was done in [Pull Request #11851](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11851)\r\n\r\nHowever, the vtctld HTTP API will remain at `{$vtctld_web_port}/api`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"qs-errors\"/>Query Serving Errors\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #10738](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/10738) we are introducing a new way to report errors from Vitess through the query interface.\r\nErrors will now have an error code for each error, which will make it easy to search for more information on the issue.\r\nFor instance, the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\naggregate functions take a single argument 'count(user_id, name)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be transformed into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVT03001: aggregate functions take a single argument 'count(user_id, name)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error code `VT03001` can then be used to search or ask for help and report problems.\r\n\r\nIf you have code searching for error strings from Vitess, this is a breaking change.\r\nMany error strings have been tweaked.\r\nIf your application is searching for specific errors, you might need to update your code.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"logstats-table-keyspace\"/>Logstats Table and Keyspace removed\r\n\r\nInformation about which tables are used is now reported by the field TablesUsed added in v15, that is a string array, listing all tables and which keyspace they are in.\r\nThe Table/Keyspace fields were deprecated in v15 and are now removed in the v16 release, more information can be found on [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"removed-stats\"/>Removed Stats\r\n\r\nThe stat `QueryRowCounts` is removed in v16 as part of [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083). `QueryRowsAffected` and `QueryRowsReturned` can be used instead to gather the same information.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-stats\"/>Deprecated Stats\r\n\r\nThe stats `QueriesProcessed` and `QueriesRouted` are deprecated in v16 as part of [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083). The same information can be inferred from the stats `QueriesProcessedByTable` and `QueriesRoutedByTable` respectively. These stats will be removed in the next release.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"normalized-lables\"/>Normalized labels in the Prometheus Exporter\r\n\r\nThe Prometheus metrics exporter now properly normalizes _all_ label names into their `snake_case` form, as it is idiomatic for Prometheus metrics. Previously, Vitess instances were emitting inconsistent labels for their metrics, with some of them being `CamelCase` and others being `snake_case`.\r\nMore information about this change can be found on [Pull Request #12057](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12057).\r\n\r\nFor example, `vtgate_topology_watcher_errors{Operation=\"GetTablet\"} 0` will become `vtgate_topology_watcher_errors{operation=\"GetTablet\"} 0`\r\n\r\nSome more of these changes are listed here -\r\n\r\n| Previous metric                                             | New Metric                                                  |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| vtgate_topology_watcher_operations{Operation=\"AddTablet\"}   | vtgate_topology_watcher_operations{operation=\"AddTablet\"}   |\r\n| vtgate_queries_processed{Plan=\"Reference\"}                  | vtgate_queries_processed{plan=\"Reference\"}                  |\r\n| vtgate_queries_routed{Plan=\"Reference\"}                     | vtgate_queries_routed{plan=\"Reference\"}                     |\r\n| vttablet_table_allocated_size{Table=\"corder\"}               | vttablet_table_allocated_size{table=\"corder\"}               |\r\n| vttablet_table_file_size{Table=\"corder\"}                    | vttablet_table_file_size{table=\"corder\"}                    |\r\n| vttablet_topology_watcher_errors{Operation=\"GetTablet\"}     | vttablet_topology_watcher_errors{operation=\"GetTablet\"}     |\r\n| vttablet_topology_watcher_operations{Operation=\"AddTablet\"} | vttablet_topology_watcher_operations{operation=\"AddTablet\"} |\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"repl-manager-removal\"/>Replication manager removal and VTOrc becomes mandatory\r\nVTOrc is now a **required** component of Vitess starting from v16. If the users want Vitess to manage replication, then they must run VTOrc.\r\nReplication manager is removed from vttablets since the responsibility of fixing replication lies entirely with VTOrc now.\r\nThe flag `disable-replication-manager` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vstream-copy-resume\"/>VStream Copy Resume\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11103](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11103) we introduced the ability to resume a `VTGate` [`VStream` copy operation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/). This is useful when a [`VStream` copy operation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/) is interrupted due to e.g. a network failure or a server restart. The `VStream` copy operation can be resumed by specifying each table's last seen primary key value in the `VStream` request. Please see the [`VStream` docs](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vdiff2-ga\"/>VDiff2 GA\r\n\r\nWe are marking [VDiff v2](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vdiff2/) as production-ready in v16. We now recommend that you use v2 rather than v1 going forward. V1 will be deprecated and eventually removed in future releases.\r\nIf you wish to use v1 for any reason, you will now need to specify the `--v1` flag.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet throttler\r\n\r\nThe tablet throttler can now be configured dynamically. Configuration is now found in the topo service, and applies to all tablets in all shards and cells of a given keyspace.\r\nIt is possible to enable or disable throttling, and to change the throttling threshold as well as the throttler query.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this feature is considered experimental in this release. For backwards compatibility `v16` still supports `vttablet`-based command line flags for throttler configuration.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on [Pull Request #11604](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11604).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"inc-backup\"/>Incremental backup and point in time recovery\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11097](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11097) we introduced native incremental backup and point in time recovery:\r\n\r\n- It is possible to take an incremental backup, starting with last known (full or incremental) backup, and up to either a specified (GTID) position, or current (\"auto\") position.\r\n- The backup is done by copying binary logs. The binary logs are rotated as needed.\r\n- It is then possible to restore a backup up to a given point in time (GTID position). This involves finding a restore path consisting of a full backup and zero or more incremental backups, applied up to the given point in time.\r\n- A server restored to a point in time remains in `DRAINED` tablet type, and does not join the replication stream (thus, \"frozen\" in time).\r\n- It is possible to take incremental backups from different tablets. It is OK to have overlaps in incremental backup contents. The restore process chooses a valid path, and is valid as long as there are no gaps in the backed up binary log content.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-flag\"/>New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-query-timeout\"/>VTGate: Support query timeout --query-timeout\r\n\r\n`--query-timeout` allows you to specify a timeout for queries. This timeout is applied to all queries.\r\nIt can be overridden by setting the `query_timeout` session variable.\r\nSetting it as query comment directive with `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` will override other values.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vrepl-parallel-workers\"/>VTTablet: VReplication parallel insert workers --vreplication-parallel-insert-workers\r\n\r\n`--vreplication-parallel-insert-workers=[integer]` enables parallel bulk inserts during the copy phase\r\nof VReplication (disabled by default). When set to a value greater than 1 the bulk inserts \u2014 each\r\nexecuted as a single transaction from the vstream packet contents \u2014 may happen in-parallel and\r\nout-of-order, but the commit of those transactions are still serialized in order.\r\n\r\nOther aspects of the VReplication copy-phase logic are preserved:\r\n\r\n  1. All statements executed when processing a vstream packet occur within a single MySQL transaction.\r\n  2. Writes to `_vt.copy_state` always follow their corresponding inserts from within the vstream packet.\r\n  3. The final `commit` for the vstream packet always follows the corresponding write to `_vt.copy_state`.\r\n  4. The vstream packets are committed in the order seen in the stream. So for any PK1 and PK2, the write to `_vt.copy_state` and  `commit` steps (steps 2 and 3 above) for PK1 will both precede the `_vt.copy_state` write and commit steps of PK2.\r\n\r\n Other phases, catchup, fast-forward, and replicating/\"running\", are unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"queryserver-lifetime\"/>VTTablet: --queryserver-config-pool-conn-max-lifetime\r\n\r\n`--queryserver-config-pool-conn-max-lifetime=[integer]` allows you to set a timeout on each connection in the query server connection pool. It chooses a random value between its value and twice its value, and when a connection has lived longer than the chosen value, it'll be removed from the pool the next time it's returned to the pool.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-throttler-config\"/>vttablet --throttler-config-via-topo\r\n\r\nThe flag `--throttler-config-via-topo` switches throttler configuration from `vttablet`-flags to the topo service. This flag is `false` by default, for backwards compatibility. It will default to `true` in future versions.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-update-throttler\"/>vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig\r\n\r\nTablet throttler configuration is now supported in `topo`. Updating the throttler configuration is done via `vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig` and applies to all tablet in all cells for a given keyspace.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# disable throttler; all throttler checks will return with \"200 OK\"\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --disable commerce\r\n\r\n# enable throttler; checks are responded with appropriate status per current metrics\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --enable commerce\r\n\r\n# Both enable and set threshold in same command. Since no query is indicated, we assume the default check for replication lag\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --enable --threshold 5.0 commerce\r\n\r\n# Change threshold. Does not affect enabled/disabled state of the throttler\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --threshold 1.5 commerce\r\n\r\n# Use a custom query\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --custom_query \"show global status like 'threads_running'\" --check_as_check_self --threshold 50 commerce\r\n\r\n# Restore default query and threshold\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --custom_query \"\" --check_as_check_shard --threshold 1.5 commerce\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11604\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-backup\"/>vtctldclient Backup --incremental_from_pos\r\n\r\nThe `Backup` command now supports `--incremental_from_pos` flag, which can receive a valid position or the value `auto`. For example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctlclient -- Backup --incremental_from_pos \"MySQL56/16b1039f-22b6-11ed-b765-0a43f95f28a3:1-615\" zone1-0000000102\r\n$ vtctlclient -- Backup --incremental_from_pos \"auto\" zone1-0000000102\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the value is `auto`, the position is evaluated as the last successful backup's `Position`. The idea with incremental backups is to create a contiguous (overlaps allowed) sequence of backups that store all changes from last full backup.\r\n\r\nThe incremental backup copies binary log files. It does not take MySQL down nor places any locks. It does not interrupt traffic on the MySQL server. The incremental backup copies complete binlog files. It initially rotates binary logs, then copies anything from the requested position and up to the last completed binary log.\r\n\r\nThe backup thus does not necessarily start _exactly_ at the requested position. It starts with the first binary log that has newer entries than requested position. It is OK if the binary logs include transactions prior to the requested position. The restore process will discard any duplicates.\r\n\r\nNormally, you can expect the backups to be precisely contiguous. Consider an `auto` value: due to the nature of log rotation and the fact we copy complete binlog files, the next incremental backup will start with the first binay log not covered by the previous backup, which in itself copied the one previous binlog file in full. Again, it is completely valid to enter any good position.\r\n\r\nThe incremental backup fails if it is unable to attain binary logs from given position (ie binary logs have been purged).\r\n\r\nThe manifest of an incremental backup has a non-empty `FromPosition` value, and a `Incremental = true` value.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-restore-from-backup\"/>vtctldclient RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos\r\n\r\n- `--restore_to_pos`: request to restore the server up to the given position (inclusive) and not one step further.\r\n- `--dry_run`:        when `true`, calculate the restore process, if possible, evaluate a path, but exit without actually making any changes to the server.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctlclient -- RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos  \"MySQL56/16b1039f-22b6-11ed-b765-0a43f95f28a3:1-220\" zone1-0000000102\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe restore process seeks a restore _path_: a sequence of backups (handles/manifests) consisting of one full backup followed by zero or more incremental backups, that can bring the server up to the requested position, inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe command fails if it cannot evaluate a restore path. Possible reasons:\r\n\r\n- there's gaps in the incremental backups\r\n- existing backups don't reach as far as requested position\r\n- all full backups exceed requested position (so there's no way to get into an ealier position)\r\n\r\nThe command outputs the restore path.\r\n\r\nThere may be multiple restore paths, the command prefers a path with the least number of backups. This has nothing to say about the amount and size of binary logs involved.\r\n\r\nThe `RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos` ends with:\r\n\r\n- the restored server in intentionally broken replication setup\r\n- tablet type is `DRAINED`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"new-vexplain-command\"/>New `vexplain` command\r\nA new `vexplain` command has been introduced with the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nVEXPLAIN [ALL|QUERIES|PLAN] explainable_stmt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will help users look at the plan that vtgate comes up with for the given query (`PLAN` type), see all the queries that are executed on all the MySQL instances (`QUERIES` type), and see the vtgate plan along with the MySQL explain output for the executed queries (`ALL` type).\r\n\r\nThe formats `VTEXPLAIN` and `VITESS` for `EXPLAIN` queries are deprecated, and these newly introduced commands should be used instead.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"important-bug-fixes\"/>Important bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"corrupted-results\"/>Corrupted results for non-full-group-by queries with JOINs\r\n\r\nAn issue in versions `<= v14.0.3` and `<= v15.0.0` that generated corrupted results for non-full-group-by queries with a JOIN\r\nis now fixed. The full issue can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/11625), and its fix [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11633).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecations-removals\"/>Deprecations and Removals\r\n\r\n- The V3 planner is deprecated as of the v16 release, and will be removed in the v17 release of Vitess.\r\n\r\n- The [VReplication v1 commands](https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/reference/vreplication/v1/) \u2014 which were deprecated in Vitess 11.0 \u2014 have been removed. You will need to use the [VReplication v2 commands](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/v2/) instead.\r\n\r\n- The `vtctlclient VExec` command was removed, having been deprecated since v12.\r\n\r\n- The `vtctlclient VReplicationExec` command has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please see [#12070](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12070) for additional details.\r\n\r\n- `vtctlclient OnlineDDL ... [complete|retry|cancel|cancel-all]` returns empty result on success instead of number of shard affected.\r\n\r\n- The dead legacy Workflow Manager related code was removed in [#12085](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12085). This included the following `vtctl` client commands: `WorkflowAction`, `WorkflowCreate`, `WorkflowWait`, `WorkflowStart`, `WorkflowStop`, `WorkflowTree`, `WorkflowDelete`.\r\n\r\n- VTAdmin's `VTExplain` endpoint has been deprecated. Users can use the new `vexplain` query format instead. The endpoint will be deleted in a future release.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"mysql-compatibility\"/>MySQL Compatibility\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"transaction-isolation-level\"/>Transaction Isolation Level\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11704](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11704) we are adding support for `set [session] transaction isolation level <transaction_characteristic>`\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ntransaction_characteristic: {\r\n    ISOLATION LEVEL level\r\n  | access_mode\r\n}\r\n\r\nlevel: {\r\n     REPEATABLE READ\r\n   | READ COMMITTED\r\n   | READ UNCOMMITTED\r\n   | SERIALIZABLE\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will set the transaction isolation level for the current session.\r\nThis will be applied to any shard where the session will open a transaction.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"transaction-access-mode\"/>Transaction Access Mode\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11704](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11704) we are adding support for `start transaction` with transaction characteristic.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSTART TRANSACTION\r\n    [transaction_characteristic [, transaction_characteristic] ...]\r\n\r\ntransaction_characteristic: {\r\n    WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT\r\n  | READ WRITE\r\n  | READ ONLY\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow users to start a transaction with these characteristics.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"support-views\"/>Support For Views\r\n\r\nViews sharded support is released as an experimental feature in `v16.0.0`.\r\nViews are not enabled by default in your Vitess cluster, but they can be turned on using the `--enable-views` flag on VTGate, and `--queryserver-enable-views` flag on VTTablet.\r\n\r\nTo read more on how views are implemented you can read the [Views Support RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/11559).\r\nAnd if you want to learn more on how to use views and its current limitations, you can read the [Views Documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/compatibility/mysql-compatibility/#views).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttestserver\"/>VTTestServer\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"perf-improvement\"/>Performance Improvement\r\n\r\nCreating a database with vttestserver was taking ~45 seconds. This can be problematic in test environments where testcases do a lot of `create` and `drop` database.\r\nIn an effort to minimize the database creation time, in [Pull Request #11918](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11918) we have changed the value of `tablet_refresh_interval` to 10s while instantiating vtcombo during vttestserver initialization. We have also made this configurable so that it can be reduced further if desired.\r\nFor any production cluster the default value of this flag is still [1 minute](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/programs/vtgate/). Reducing this value might put more stress on Topo Server (since we now read from Topo server more often) but for testing purposes\r\nthis shouldn't be a concern.\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"backup-comp-benchmarks\"/>Backup Compression Benchmarks\r\n\r\nCompression benchmarks have been added to the `mysqlctl` package.\r\n\r\nThe benchmarks fetch and compress a ~6 GiB tar file containing 3 InnoDB files using different built-in and external compressors.\r\n\r\nHere are sample results from a 2020-era Mac M1 with 16 GiB of memory:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ go test -bench=BenchmarkCompress ./go/vt/mysqlctl -run=NONE -timeout=12h -benchtime=1x -v\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: arm64\r\npkg: vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/mysqlctl\r\nBenchmarkCompressLz4Builtin\r\n    compression_benchmark_test.go:310: downloading data from https://www.dropbox.com/s/raw/smmgifsooy5qytd/enwiki-20080103-pages-articles.ibd.tar.zst\r\n    BenchmarkCompressLz4Builtin-8                  1        11737493087 ns/op        577.98 MB/s             2.554 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPargzipBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPargzipBuiltin-8              1        31083784040 ns/op        218.25 MB/s             2.943 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPgzipBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPgzipBuiltin-8                1        13325299680 ns/op        509.11 MB/s             2.910 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdBuiltin-8                 1        18683863911 ns/op        363.09 MB/s             3.150 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternal\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternal-8                1        10795487675 ns/op        628.41 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalFast4\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalFast4-8           1        7139319009 ns/op         950.23 MB/s             2.323 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT0\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT0-8              1        4393860434 ns/op        1543.97 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT4\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT4-8              1        4389559744 ns/op        1545.49 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    PASS\r\n    cleaning up \"/var/folders/96/k7gzd7q10zdb749vr02q7sjh0000gn/T/ee7d47b45ef09786c54fa2d7354d2a68.dat\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"refactor\"/>Refactor\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet-sidecar-schema\"/>VTTablet Sidecar Schema Maintenance Refactor\r\n\r\nThis is an internal refactor and should not change the behavior of Vitess as seen by users. \r\n\r\nDevelopers will see a difference though: v16 changes the way we maintain vttablet's sidecar database schema (also referred to as the `_vt`\r\ndatabase). Instead of using the `WithDDL` package, introduced in [PR #6348](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/6348), we use a\r\ndeclarative approach. Developers will now have to update the desired schema in the `go/vt/sidecardb/schema` directory.\r\n\r\nThe desired schema is specified, one per table. A new module `sidecardb`, compares this to the existing schema and\r\nperforms the required `create` or `alter` to reach it. This is done whenever a primary vttablet starts up.\r\n\r\nThe sidecar tables `local_metadata` and `shard_metadata` are no longer in use and all references to them are removed as\r\npart of this refactor. They were used previously for Orchestrator support, which has been superseded by `vtorc`.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/doc/releasenotes/16_0_0_changelog.md).\r\n\r\nThe release includes 378 commits (excluding merges)\r\n\r\nThanks to all our contributors: @EmadMokhtar, @GuptaManan100, @Weijun-H, @WilliamLu99, @ajm188, @arthurschreiber, @arvind-murty, @brendar, @brirams, @dbussink, @deepthi, @dependabot[bot], @draftcode, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @jjh-kim, @johanoskarsson, @kbslvsk, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pbibra, @pudiva, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rsajwani, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot[bot], @vmg, @yoheimuta\r\n", "created_at": "2023-02-28T15:09:03Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.9.2", "tag_name": "knative-v1.9.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.9.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## Changes since [1.9.1](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/knative-v1.9.1)\r\n\r\nRebuilt with go1.19.6 to address CVEs\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.19.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved", "created_at": "2023-02-28T11:21:15Z", "project": "Knative", "repo": "knative/serving", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.88.1", "tag_name": "v1.88.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.88.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "## [v1.88.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.88.1)\r\n\r\nReleased at 2023-02-27\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: add `-snapshotCreateTimeout` flag to allow configuring timeout for [snapshot process](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3551).\r\n* FEATURE: expose `vm_http_requests_total` and `vm_http_request_errors_total` metrics for `snapshot/*` [paths](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots) at [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html) `vmstorage` and [VictoriaMetrics Single](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3551).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html): add the ability to discover keys for JWT verification via [OpenID discovery endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html#using-openid-discovery-endpoint-for-jwt-signature-verification).\r\n* FEATURE: add `-internStringDisableCache` command-line flag for disabling the cache for [interned strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning). This flag may be useful in [some cases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3863) for reducing memory usage at the cost of higher CPU usage.\r\n* FEATURE: add `-internStringCacheExpireDuration` command-line flag for controlling the lifetime of cached [interned strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): fix panic when executing the query `aggr_func(rollup*(some_value))`. The panic has been introduced in [v1.88.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1880).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): use the provided `-remoteWrite.*` auth options when determining whether the remote storage supports [VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#victoriametrics-remote-write-protocol). Previously the auth options were ignored. This was preventing from automatic switch to VictoriaMetrics remote write protocol.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not register `vm_promscrape_config_*` metrics if `-promscrape.config` flag is not used. Previously those metrics were registered and never updated, which was confusing and could trigger false-positive alerts.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): skip measurements with no fields when migrating data from influxdb. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3837).\r\n* BUGFIX: delete failed snapshot contents from disk on failed attempt to [create snapshot](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-work-with-snapshots). Previously failed snapshot contents could remain on disk in incomplete state. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3858).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run

in how names are displayed during a Packer\n     build for JSON templates. Previously only the builder type or the builder\n     name, if it was set, would be displayed. Now for named builders\n     (`\"name\":\"mybuilder\"`) the builder's type and name will be displayed (i.e\n     \"<type>.mybuilder\".

This\r\n  had been the original intention; it was a mistake that it was optional.\r\n  Unfortunately, due to a separate defect in the update verification logic for\r\n  static hosts, it was possible for a host to be updated (but not created) with\r\n  a port. This meant that targets could use ports attached to host addresses,\r\n  which was not the intention and leads to confusing behavior across different\r\n  installations. In this version, updating static hosts will no longer allow\r\n  ports to be part of the address; when authorizing a session, any port on such\r\n  a host will be ignored in favor of the default port on the target. In Boundary\r\n  0.14.0, this will become an error instead. As a consequence, it means that the\r\n  fallback logic for targets that did not have a default port defined is no\r\n  longer in service; all targets must now have a default port defined.\r\n* With the introduction of `vault-ssh-certificate` credential libraries, the\r\n  `vault` credential library subtype is being renamed to `vault-generic` to\r\n  denote it as a credential library that can be used in a generalized way to\r\n  issue credentials from vault. Existing credential libraries with the\r\n  subtype of `vault` will be updated to `vault-generic`. The subtype of\r\n  `vault` will still be accepted as a valid subtype in API requests to the\r\n  credential libraries endpoints, but is deprecated. Instead `vault-generic`\r\n  should be used. In addition the `boundary credential-libraries create\r\n  vault` and `boundary credential-libraries update vault` subcommands will\r\n  still function, but are deprecated. Instead `boundary credential-libraries\r\n  create vault-generic` and `boundary credential-libraries update\r\n  vault-generic` should be used. Also note that any credential library created\r\n  using the subtype of `vault`, either via the API or via the deprecated\r\n  subcommand, will have the subtype set to `vault-generic`. The deprecated\r\n  subtype and subcommands will be removed in boundary 0.14.0, at which point\r\n  `vault-generic` must be used.\r\n* In Boundary 0.1.8 using the `-format=json` option with the cli would provide\r\n  a `status_code` for successful API requests from the cli. However, in the\r\n  case where an error was returned, the JSON would use `status` instead. This\r\n  inconsistency has been fixed, with `status_code` being used in both cases.\r\n  For error cases `status` will still be populated, but is deprecated and will\r\n  be removed in 0.14.0.\r\n\r\n### New and Improved\r\n\r\n* Direct Address Targets: You can now set an address directly on a target,\r\n  bypassing the need for host catalogs, host sets and hosts.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2613))\r\n* Custom Response Headers: Adds ability to set api and ui response headers based\r\n  on status code. Includes default secure CSP and other headers.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2587))\r\n* metrics: Adds accepted connections and closed connections counters to keep track\r\n  downstream connections for worker and controller servers.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2668))\r\n* Egress and Ingress worker filters: The target `worker_filter` field has been deprecated and \r\n replaced with egress and ingress worker filters. Egress worker filters determine which workers are\r\n used to access targets. Ingress worker filters (HCP Boundary only) determine which workers are \r\n used to connect with a client to initiate a session. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2654))\r\n* Multi-Hop Sessions (HCP Boundary only): Multi-hop PKI workers can communicate with each other to serve \r\n 2 primary purposes: authentication and session proxying. This results in the ability to chain \r\n multiple workers together to access services hidden under layers of network security. Multi-hop \r\n workers can also establish a TCP session through multiple workers, with the ability to reverse \r\n proxy and establish a connection.\r\n* ui: Upgrade Admin UI to Ember 4.4.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1523))\r\n* ui: Add support for JSON credentials in Admin UI.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1498))\r\n* Vault SSH certificate credential library: A new credential library that uses\r\n  the vault ssh secret engine to generate ssh private key and certificates. The\r\n  library can be used as an injected application credential source for targets\r\n  that support credential injection. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2860))\r\n* ui: Add support for managed groups in add-principals list. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1548))\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* plugins: Ignore `SIGHUP` sent to parent process; some init systems, notably\r\n  `dumb-init`, would pass them along to the child processes and cause the\r\n  plugin to exit ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2677))\r\n* data warehouse: Fix bug that caused credential dimensions to not get\r\n    associated with session facts ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2787)).\r\n* sessions: Fix two authorizeSession race conditions in handleProxy. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2795))\r\n* cli: When using `-format=json` the JSON was inconsistent in how it reported\r\n  status codes.

The full list is below, but here are some of our favorites:\r\n- [`kustomize localize`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/cmd/localize/): a brand new alpha command that localizes remote content. You\u2019ll be able to `build` the localized kustomization without network access and performance delays! Please give it a try and let us know what you think in #4996. See more details in its entry under Features below.\r\n- support for four new Helm fields, by popular request: `additionalValuesFiles`, `skipTests`, `apiVersions` and `nameTemplate`\r\n- A new [`sortOptions` kustomization field](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/sortoptions/) gives you fine-grained control over resource ordering in build output\r\n- Significant performance improvements!\r\n\r\nA HUGE thank you to everyone who contributed to this release! \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- #4930: Remove deprecated alpha cfg and fn commands: `kustomize fn sink`, `kustomize fn source`, `kustomize fn wrap`, `kustomize fn xargs`, `kustomize cfg annotate`, `kustomize cfg create-setter`, `kustomize cfg delete-setter`, `kustomize cfg delete-substitution`, `kustomize cfg create-substitution`, `kustomize cfg fmt`, `kustomize cfg init`, `kustomize cfg list-setters`, `kustomize cfg merge`, `kustomize cfg merge3`, `kustomize cfg set`.\r\n- #4983, #4954, #4922, #4900, #4885: Warning: We made major improvements to the maintainability of the URL-parsing code for remote URLs, fixing several bugs in the process. We have test coverage for backwards-compatibility with all documented supported URLs, but if you experience a regression with a remote URL, please file an issue.\r\n  - #4985: If you previously included .git in an AWS or Azure URL, we will no longer automatically remove that suffix. You may need to add an extra `/` to replace the .git for the URL to properly resolve.\r\n  - #4954: Drop support for using `gh:` as a host (e.g. `gh:kubernetes-sigs/kustomize`). We were unable to find any usage of or basis for this and believe it may have been targeting a custom gitconfig shorthand syntax.\r\n- #4911: Drop support for a very old, legacy style of patches. `patches` used to be allowed to be used as an alias for `patchesStrategicMerge` in kustomize v3. You now have to use `patchesStrategicMerge` explicitly, or update to the new syntax supported by `patches`. See examples in the PR description of #4911.\r\n- #4731: Remove a potential build-time side-effect in ConfigMapGenerator and SecretGenerator, which loaded values from the local environment under some circumstances, breaking `kustomize build`'s side-effect-free promise. While this behavior was never intended, we deprecated it and are announcing it as a breaking change since it existed for a long time. See also the Eschewed Features documentation.\r\n- #4929: Duplicate fields in Kustomization files will now result in an error instead of them silently being ignored in an undefined order.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- #4723, #4923: We are deprecating the following kustomization fields. **These fields will never be removed from the kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 Kustomization API**, but they will not be included in the kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1 Kustomization API. When Kustomization v1 is available, we will announce the deprecation of the v1beta1 version. There will be at least two releases between deprecation and removal of Kustomization v1beta1 support from the kustomize CLI, and removal itself will happen in a future major version bump.\r\n  - patchesStrategicMerge. Please use [patches](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/) instead\r\n  - patchesJson6902. Please use [patches](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/) instead\r\n  - vars. Please use [replacements](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/replacements/) instead.\r\n  - imageTags. This is an alias for [images](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/images/), please switch to images.\r\n- #5000: The `--short` flag for `kustomize version` is deprecated.\r\n- #4954: Deprecate RepoSpec `git::` prefix, which is invalid. Kustomize currently strips it, but will stop doing so in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- #4652: New [`kustomize localize` command](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/cmd/localize/) to download any remote content from your kustomization directory and create a new, localized copy with file paths to the local content replacing the URLs. Please leave your feedback here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/4996\r\n- #4019: New [kustomization field `sortOptions`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/sortoptions/), that lets you configure the sort order of resources.\r\n- #4733: `kustomize edit fix` converts `patchesStrategicMerge` to `patches`\r\n- #4947: Allow fieldspecs (used in advanced transformer configuration) to start with a slash.\r\n- #5000: Output of `kustomize version` is improved. YAML and JSON formats are now available via the new `--output` flag.  \r\n- #4986: Repospec: support ssh urls with ssh certificates\r\n- #4926, #4808: Support for more `helm template` args in the `helmCharts` field: `additionalValuesFiles`, `skipTests`, `apiVersions` and `nameTemplate`.\r\n#4886: Wildcard support for creation in ReplacementTransformer\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes/performance improvements\r\n\r\n- #4863: Fix RepoSpec query extraction\r\n- #4985: Remove forced .git suffix in RepoSpec\r\n  - Arbitrary git servers that do not follow the .git directory naming convention can now be used with Kustomize.\r\n  - The .git suffix no longer incorrectly appears in origin annotations in some cases.\r\n- #4791, #4944, #4809: Significant performance improvements from refactoring metadata handling in the api and kyaml modules\r\n- #4789: Replacements now throw errors on invalid targets\r\n- #4890: Fix null value handling when applying strategic merge patches. A null in the patch is a deletion directive, but a null in the target should be preserved.\r\n- #4654: The working directory of exec KRM-style functions is now the kustomization root that called it. This fixes a bug where KRM exec function executables were looked up incorrectly in base/overlay contexts.\r\n- #4751, #4805: When using `labels.includeTemplates`, create template/metadata if not present.\r\n- #4834: Respect `options.disableNameSuffixHash` in configmap and secret generator in overlays\r\n- #4919: Allow overriding of name suffix transformer default configuration\r\n- #4895: Name references to local-only objects are now correctly resolved before the objects are removed from the set to be printed.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- #4877: Update minimum Go version to Go 1.19\r\n- #4830: Update kyaml's dependency swag to v0.22.3\r\n- #4960: Update sigs.k8s.io/yaml to v1.3.0\r\n- #4965: Bump k8s.io/kube-openapi to remove archived dependency\r\n- #4889: All module net and text dependent package CVE-2022-41717 and CVE-2022-32149 vulnerabilities\r\n- #4970: Replace github/pkg/errors with sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/kyaml/errors\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2023-02-02T16:41:21Z", "project": "Kustomize", "repo": "kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "type": "Config", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.23.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/commits/938e2d6ef27697fcba8c7450fa988fb76850b238", "repo_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet", "body": "(packaging) Updating manpage file for 7.x", "created_at": "2023-02-02T00:41:16Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v11.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gluster/glusterfs/commits/a54e44ea5010717ed22c62055f368f3a8f4d4b12", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs", "body": "Update GlusterFS 11.0 release notes (#3967)\n\nSigned-off-by: Shwetha K Acharya <sacharya@redhat.com>", "created_at": "2023-02-01T16:37:42Z", "project": "Glusterfs", "repo": "gluster/glusterfs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "MooseFS 3.0.117", "tag_name": "v3.0.117", "html_url": "https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs/releases/tag/v3.0.117", "repo_url": "https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs", "body": "Dear MooseFS Users,\r\n\r\nWe are happy to announce that MooseFS 3.0.117 is released! \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a bugfix release.

to v2.1.0\r\n* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/master/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB\r\n* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:\r\n  * apollo-configservice\r\n  * apollo-adminservice\r\n  * apollo-portal\r\n* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204\r\n```sql\r\nuse ApolloPortalDB;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;\r\ndelete

histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float histograms),\r\nit is a one-way street since older versions do not support float histograms.\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format

For more information, see [CVE-2022-43758](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-34p5-jp77-fcrc).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where sensitive fields and credentials like secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys were stored as plaintext on Kubernetes objects. This is a follow-up security fix to address the fields missed in [CVE-2021-36782](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f). For more information, see [CVE-2022-43757](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-cq4p-vp5q-4522).\r\n\r\n- Improved the generation process of Rancher's `cattle-token` to make the token random. Before, `cattle-token` did not use any random value in its composition, which caused the token to be always predictable. For more information, see [CVE-2022-43755](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8c69-r38j-rpfj).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an authorization logic flaw that allowed an authenticated user on any downstream cluster to (1) open a shell pod in the Rancher local cluster and (2) have limited kubectl access to the local cluster. For more information, see [CVE-2022-21953](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g25r-gvq3-wrq7).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following security related updates were performed in this release to address security issues:\r\n\r\n- Fixed a validation check issue where Rancher generated tokens are not revoked after modifications are made to a configured authentication provider. This issue is only applicable if external authentication providers were configured in Rancher. For more information, see security advisory [GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9).\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of Rancher's Fleet chart to `101.0.1+up0.5.1` to address two security issues in [`rancher/wrangler`](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler) dependency:\r\n\r\n  - The high severity [CVE-2022-31249](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-qrg7-hfx7-95c5) that could lead to a command injection vulnerability in Rancher's Continuous Delivery feature through Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n  - The medium severity [CVE-2022-43756](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-8fcj-gf77-47mg) that could cause a denial of service (DoS) attack in Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of [`crewjam/saml`](https://github.com/crewjam/saml) SAML library to address the critical severity [CVE-2022-41912](https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-j2jp-wvqg-wc2g).\r\n\r\n- Updated the base image version of Rancher `rancher/rancher` and Rancher Agent `rancher/rancher-agent` images from SUSE's SLE BCI Base 15 SP3 to 15 SP4 [`registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4`](https://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base-15sp4/index.html) due to 15 SP3 reaching its end-of-life (EOL).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) page or in Rancher's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue where handlers would infinitely loop if a user had no tokens, or the user only had tokens that did not have their ExtraByProvider field set. See [#39401](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39401).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Pods critical to running Rancher did not use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for its sidecar audit logging instead of busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. Rancher recommends admins to add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not be able to perform some of the actions within Azure AD if the permissions are insufficient, so you may encounter errors.\r\n- For RKE2/K3s node driver clusters, when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app, the behavior has changed for pulling images. Previously, only the global container registry was used. As of this release, by default, if a private registry exists in the cluster config, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. To change the default registry, a custom registry can be specified during the Helm chart install/upgrade workflow.\r\n- Beginning with Rancher 2.6.9, Rancher was built using go version 1.19. As part of this upgrade, Rancher's clients will only communicate with servers running tls version 1.2 or higher. Ensure that any servers integrated with rancher are upgraded to use this tls version or higher before upgrading to this version of rancher.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.1\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.6 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.12\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Provisioning new RKE1 clusters with a password-protected private registry may fail. See [#40321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40321#issuecomment-1407095199) for a workaround and more information on the issue.\r\n    - In RKE1 clusters on Kubernetes v1.24, cadvisor `container` labels and metric series break Monitoring V2 dashboards. See [#38934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38934#issuecomment-1294585708) for a workaround and more details on the issue.\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Kubernetes RKE1 1.24.x clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4; high CPU usage is also observed. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-01-24T17:33:32Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.5.7", "tag_name": "v3.5.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd", "body": "Please check out [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.5.md) for a full list of changes.

"https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "## Release Note\r\n**v1.4.0 released!** \ud83c\udf86\r\n\r\nThis release introduces many enhancements, improvements, and bug fixes as described below about stability, performance, data integrity, troubleshooting, and so on. Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- [Kubernetes 1.25 Support](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/important-notes/#pod-security-policies-disabled--pod-security-admission-introduction)\r\n  In the previous versions, Longhorn relies on Pod Security Policy (PSP) to authorize Longhorn components for privileged operations. From Kubernetes 1.25, PSP has been removed and replaced with Pod Security Admission (PSA). Longhorn v1.4.0 supports opt-in PSP enablement, so it can support Kubernetes versions with or without PSP.\r\n\r\n- [ARM64 GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4206)\r\n  ARM64 has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0. After receiving more user feedback and increasing testing coverage, ARM64 distribution has been stabilized with quality as per our regular regression testing, so it is qualified for general availability.\r\n\r\n- [RWX GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220727-dedicated-recovery-backend-for-rwx-volume-nfs-server.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/)\r\n  RWX has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0, but it lacks availability support when the Longhorn Share Manager component behind becomes unavailable. Longhorn v1.4.0 supports NFS recovery backend based on Kubernetes built-in resource, ConfigMap, for recovering NFS client connection during the fail-over period. Also, the NFS client hard mode introduction will further avoid previous potential data loss. For the detail, please check the issue and enhancement proposal.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Snapshot Checksum](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  Data integrity is a continuous effort for Longhorn. In this version, Snapshot Checksum has been introduced w/ some settings to allow users to enable or disable checksum calculation with different modes.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Bit-rot Protection](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will periodically calculate and check the checksums of volume snapshots, find corrupted snapshots, then fix them.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Replica Rebuilding Speedup](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will use the calculated snapshot checksum to avoid needless snapshot replication between nodes for improving replica rebuilding speed and resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221103-filesystem-trim.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/trim-filesystem/#trim-the-filesystem-in-a-longhorn-volume)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports UNMAP SCSI command to reclaim space from the block volume.\r\n\r\n- [Online Volume Expansion](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/expansion)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports optional parameters to pass size expansion requests when updating the volume frontend to support online volume expansion and resize the filesystem via CSI node driver.\r\n\r\n- [Local Volume via Data Locality Strict Mode](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20200819-keep-a-local-replica-to-engine.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#default-data-locality)\r\n  Local volume is based on a new Data Locality setting, Strict Local. It will allow users to create one replica volume staying in a consistent location, and the data transfer between the volume frontend and engine will be through a local socket instead of the TCP stack to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Recurring Job Backup Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20201002-allow-recurring-backup-detached-volumes.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/restore-recurring-jobs-from-a-backup/)\r\n  Recurring jobs binding to a volume can be backed up to the remote backup target together with the volume backup metadata. They can be restored back as well for a better operation experience.\r\n\r\n- [Volume IO Metrics](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/monitoring/metrics/#volume)\r\n  Longhorn enriches Volume metrics by providing real-time IO stats including IOPS, latency, and throughput of R/W IO. Users can set up a monotoning solution like Prometheus to monitor volume performance.\r\n\r\n- [Longhorn System Backup & Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220913-longhorn-system-backup-restore.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/system-backup-restore/)\r\n  Users can back up the longhorn system to the remote backup target. Afterward, it's able to restore back to an existing cluster in place or a new cluster for specific operational purposes.\r\n\r\n- [Support Bundle Enhancement](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221109-support-bundle-enhancement.md)\r\n  Longhorn introduces a new support bundle integration based on a general [support bundle kit](https://github.com/rancher/support-bundle-kit) solution. This can help us collect more complete troubleshooting info and simulate the cluster environment.\r\n\r\n- [Tunable Timeout between Engine and Replica](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#engine-to-replica-timeout)\r\n  In the current Longhorn versions, the default timeout between the Longhorn engine and replica is fixed without any exposed user settings. This will potentially bring some challenges for users having a low-spec infra environment. By exporting the setting configurable, it will allow users adaptively tune the stability of volume operations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before installing Longhorn v1.4.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher App Marketplace, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before upgrading to Longhorn v1.4.0 from v1.3.x. Only support upgrading from 1.3.x.**\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Pod Security Policy is an opt-in setting. If installing Longhorn with PSP support, need to enable it first.\r\n- The built-in CSI Snapshotter sidecar is upgraded to v5.0.1. The v1beta1 version of Volume Snapshot custom resource is deprecated but still supported. However, it will be removed after upgrading CSI Snapshotter to 6.1 or later versions in the future, so please start using v1 version instead before the deprecated version is removed.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues after Release\r\n\r\nPlease follow up on [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Outstanding-Known-Issues-of-Releases) about any outstanding issues found after this release.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Reclaim/Shrink space of volume ([836](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836)) - @yangchiu @derekbit @smallteeths @shuo-wu\r\n- [FEATURE] Backup/Restore Longhorn System ([1455](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455)) - @c3y1huang @khushboo-rancher\r\n- [FEATURE] Online volume expansion ([1674](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674)) - @shuo-wu @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Record recurring schedule in the backups and allow user choose to use it for the restored volume ([2227](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227)) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [FEATURE] NFS support (RWX) GA ([2293](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Support metrics for Volume IOPS, throughput and latency real time ([2406](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Support bundle enhancement ([2759](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Automatic identifying of corrupted replica (bit rot detection) ([3198](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Local volume for distributed data workloads ([3957](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Support K8s 1.25 by updating removed deprecated resource versions like PodSecurityPolicy ([4003](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Faster resync time for fresh replica rebuilding ([4092](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4092)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Introduce checksum for snapshots ([4210](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Update K8s version support and component/pkg/build dependencies ([4239](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4239)) - @yangchiu @PhanLe1010\r\n- [BUG] data corruption due to COW and block size not being aligned during rebuilding replicas  ([4354](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4354)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT]  Adjust the iSCSI timeout and the engine-to-replica timeout settings ([4491](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Using specific block size in Longhorn volume's filesystem ([4594](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4594)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Speed up replica rebuilding by the metadata such as ctime of snapshot disk files ([4783](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Configure successfulJobsHistoryLimit of CronJobs ([1711](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1711)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Allow customization of the cipher used by cryptsetup in volume encryption ([3353](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3353)) - @mantissahz @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] New setting to limit the concurrent volume restoring from backup ([4558](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4558)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Make FS format options configurable in storage class ([4642](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4642)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n\r\n## Improvement\r\n\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Change the script into a docker run command mentioned in 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc ([1521](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1521)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Improve 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc.

This release is a new effort and is not related to a previous preview of code released in the [2.x-archive](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/2.x-archive) branch which was an experimental re-architecture of Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Server HTTP API and wire data formats *have not changed* for the 2.0.0 release. Eureka servers and clients should be backwards and forwards compatible over the wire. This release was primarily driven for compatibility with [Spring Framework 6.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga) and [Spring Boot 3.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/24/spring-boot-3-0-goes-ga) and the change to [Jakarta EE 9](https://jakarta.ee/release/9/).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\nThe Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API is not backwards compatible with 1.x.\r\nEureka 1.x included support for Jersey 1 and optional Support for Jersey 2. In many cases, Jersey 1 was the default and was baked into the `eureka-core` and `eureka-client` modules. Having a default client has been removed. The new `eureka-client-jersey3` and `eureka-core-jersey3` should now be used if no other implementation is provided (such as Spring Cloud support for a `RestTemplate` implementation).\r\nThe [`DiscoveryClient constructors`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/b03151940fe2a647bb0697bb0c6f1057f4db46e8/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java#L236-L279) have been updated to have a new required [`TransportClientFactories`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/2.x/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/shared/transport/jersey/TransportClientFactories.java) parameter. The majority of the Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API has remained unchanged.\r\nAll references to `javax.*` classes have been changed to `jakarta.*` classes and the appropriate modules have been added.\r\nThe `eureka-server-governator` module was removed. There is no current support for the JakartaEE version of `@Inject`.\r\nThe `eureka-server` module currently does not build a functional WAR file. The recommended way of creating a Eureka 2.0.0 server is via Spring Cloud Netflix as a Spring Boot application.\r\nThe build now requires JDK 11 because of some tests that require Jetty and the version of Jetty that supports Jakarta EE 9 requires Java 11. The build still targets Java 8.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease try things out and provide any feedback or issues at https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues.\r\n", "created_at":

OpenEBS 3.4 welcomes exciting new changes to our NVMe-first storage engine Mayastor with the release of v2.0.0. Jiva, cStor, LocalPV hostpath, Dynamic NFS Provision and Node Disk Manager go through another round of critical bug fixes and user enhancements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.21 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.4.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 2.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.4.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.4.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 1.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.8.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.7.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.4.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.4.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.10.0 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 2.1.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.5.1 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.10 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed changelog is available under the component repositories listed above. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Support for installation  of Mayastor, the NVMe-based storage engine, via the OpenEBS helm chart.
