These nodes run in dedicated instance groups that can be scaled horizontally.\r\n\r\nIn 1.21, this feature is behind a feature flag as node role name, labels, taints, and domains can change based on feedback from the community.\r\n\r\n## Warm Pool (AWS only)\r\n\r\nA Warm Pool contains pre-initialized EC2 instances that can join the cluster significantly faster than regular instances. These instances run the kOps configuration process, pull known container images, and then shut down. When the ASG needs to scale out it will pull instances from the warm pool if any are available.\r\n\r\nSee the [warm pool](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#warmpool-aws-only) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n# Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* Protokube now runs as a systemd process rather than a docker container.\r\n\r\n* Support for AWS launch configurations has been removed in favour of launch templates.\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use Node Termination Handler's Queue Processor mode, which offers more functionality than the IMDS Processor mode. See [the addons page](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#queue-processor-mode) for more information.\r\n\r\n* New addon for the [CSI snapshot-controller](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#snapshot-controller).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.13 and 1.14 has been removed.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* The ClusterRoleBinding for AWS EBS CSI DaemonSet has changed name. If you installed this addon before kOps 1.21, you need run `kubectl delete crb ebs-csi-node-binding`.\r\n\r\n* To support [Node Termination Handler's Queue Process mode](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#node-termination-handler), AWS cluster deletion now requires the kops CLI have `sqs:ListQueues` and `events:ListRules` permissions regardless of whether or not the addon is used.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.22.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used as of kOps 1.22. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.21.0 release\r\n\r\n* Release 1.21.0 [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb)

"type": "VersionControl", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.3.0", "tag_name": "v3.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v3.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "body": "### Features\r\n- Containers inside VMs created by `podman machine` will now automatically handle port forwarding - containers in `podman machine` VMs that publish ports via `--publish` or `--publish-all` will have these ports not just forwarded on the VM, but also on the host system.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command's `--network` option now accepts advanced network options (e.g. `--network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns`) ([#10807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10807)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` commmand now supports Kubernetes liveness probes, which will be created as Podman healthchecks.\r\n- Podman now provides a systemd unit, `podman-restart.service`, which, when enabled, will restart all containers that were started with `--restart=always` after the system reboots.\r\n- Rootless Podman can now be configured to use CNI networking by default by using the `rootless_networking` option in `containers.conf`.\r\n- Images can now be pulled using `image:tag@digest` syntax (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34@sha256:1b0d4ddd99b1a8c8a80e885aafe6034c95f266da44ead992aab388e6aa91611a`) ([#6721](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6721)).\r\n- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands can now be used to checkpoint containers that are in pods, and restore those containers into pods.\r\n- The `podman container restore` command now features a new option, `--publish`, to change the ports that are forwarded to a container that is being restored from an exported checkpoint.\r\n- The `podman container checkpoint` command now features a new option, `--compress`, to specify the compression algorithm that will be used on the generated checkpoint.\r\n- The `podman pull` command can now pull multiple images at once (e.g. `podman pull fedora:34 ubi8:latest` will pull both specified images).\r\n- THe `podman cp` command can now copy files from one container into another directly (e.g. `podman cp containera:/etc/hosts containerb:/etc/`) ([#7370](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7370)).\r\n- The `podman cp` command now supports a new option, `--archive`, which controls whether copied files will be chown'd to the UID and GID of the user of the destination container.\r\n- The `podman stats` command now provides two additional metrics: Average CPU, and CPU time.\r\n- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--pid`, to specify the PID namespace of the pod. If specified, containers that join the pod will automatically share its PID namespace.\r\n- The `podman pod create` command supports a new flag, `--infra-name`, which allows the name of the pod's infra container to be set ([#10794](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10794)).\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command has had its output reformatted - it is now much clearer what images were pulled and what containers were updated.\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command now supports a new option, `--dry-run`, which reports what would be updated but does not actually perform the update ([#9949](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9949)).\r\n- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--secret`, to mount secrets into build containers.\r\n- The `podman manifest remove` command now has a new alias, `podman manifest rm`.\r\n- The `podman login` command now supports a new option, `--verbose`, to print detailed information about where the credentials entered were stored.\r\n- The `podman events` command now supports a new event, `exec_died`, which is produced when an exec session exits, and includes the exit code of the exec session.\r\n- The `podman system connection add` command now supports adding connections that connect using the `tcp://` and `unix://` URL schemes.\r\n- The `podman system connection list` command now supports a new flag, `--format`, to determine how the output is printed.\r\n- The `podman volume prune` and `podman volume ls` commands' `--filter` option now support a new filter, `until`, that matches volumes created before a certain time ([#10579](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10579)).\r\n- The `podman ps --filter` option's `network` filter now accepts a new value: `container:`, which matches containers that share a network namespace with a specific container ([#10361](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10361)).\r\n- The `podman diff` command can now accept two arguments, allowing two images or two containers to be specified; the diff between the two will be printed ([#10649](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10649)).\r\n- Podman can now optionally copy-up content from containers into volumes mounted into those containers earlier (at creation time, instead of at runtime) via the `prepare_on_create` option in `containers.conf` ([#10262](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10262)).\r\n- A new option, `--gpus`, has been added to `podman create` and `podman run` as a no-op for better compatibility with Docker. If the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed, GPUs should be automatically added to containers without using the flag.\r\n- If an invalid subcommand is provided, similar commands to try will now be suggested in the error message.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The `podman system reset` command now removes non-Podman (e.g. Buildah and CRI-O) containers as well.\r\n- The new port forwarding offered by `podman machine` requires [gvproxy](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) in order to function.\r\n- Podman will now automatically create the default CNI network if it does not exist, for both root and rootless users. This will only be done once per user - if the network is subsequently removed, it will not be recreated.\r\n- The `install.cni` makefile option has been removed. It is no longer required to distribute the default `87-podman.conflist` CNI configuration file, as Podman will now automatically create it.\r\n- The `--root` option to Podman will not automatically clear all default storage options when set. Storage options can be set manually using `--storage-opt` ([#10393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10393)).\r\n- The output of `podman system connection list` is now deterministic, with connections being sorted alpabetically by their name.\r\n- The auto-update service (`podman-auto-update.service`) has had its default timer adjusted so it now starts at a random time up to 15 minutes after midnight, to help prevent system congestion from numerous daily services run at once.\r\n- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now depend on `network-online.target` by default ([#10655](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10655)).\r\n- Systemd unit files generated by `podman generate systemd` now use `Type=notify` by default, instead of using PID files.\r\n- The `podman info` command's logic for detecting package versions on Gentoo has been improved, and should be significantly faster.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not perform SELinux relabelling of volumes specified with a `mountPath` that included the `:z` or `:Z` options ([#9371](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9371)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would ignore the `USER` and `EXPOSE` directives in images ([#9609](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9609)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would only accept lowercase pull policies.\r\n- Fixed a bug where named volumes mounted into containers with the `:z` or `:Z` options were not appropriately relabelled for access from the container ([#10273](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10273)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs -f` command, with the `journald` log driver, could sometimes fail to pick up the last line of output from a container ([#10323](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10323)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where running `podman rm` on a container created with the `--rm` option would occasionally emit an error message saying the container failed to be removed, when it was successfully removed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where starting a Podman container would segfault if the `LISTEN_PID` and `LISTEN_FDS` environment variables were set, but `LISTEN_FDNAMES` was not ([#10435](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10435)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers were sometimes not cleaned up when run without `-d` and when the associated `podman exec` process was killed before completion.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman system service` could, when run in a systemd unit file with sdnotify in use, drop some connections when it was starting up.\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers run using the REST API using the `slirp4netns` network mode would leave zombie processes that were not cleaned up until `podman system service` exited ([#9777](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9777)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would leave zombie processes after its initial launch that were not cleaned up until it exited ([#10575](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10575)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where VMs created by `podman machine` could not be started after the host system restarted ([#10824](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10824)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod ps` command would not show headers for optional information (e.g. container names when the `--ctr-names` option was given).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman create` and `podman run` commands would ignore timezone configuration from the server's `containers.conf` file ([#11124](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11124)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would only respect `.containerignore` and not `.dockerignore` files (when both are present, `.containerignore` will be preferred) ([#10907](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10907)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to send the Dockerfile being built to the server when it was excluded by the `.dockerignore` file, resulting in an error ([#9867](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9867)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command could unexpectedly stop streaming the output of the build ([#10154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10154)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to build when run on Windows ([#11259](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11259)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest create` command accepted at most two arguments (an arbitrary number of images are allowed as arguments, which will be added to the manifest).\r\n- Fixed a bug where named volumes would not be properly chowned to the UID and GID of the directory they were mounted over when first mounted into a container ([#10776](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10776)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where named volumes created using a volume plugin would be removed from Podman, even if the plugin reported a failure to remove the volume ([#11214](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11214)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman exec -i` command would hang when input was provided via shell redirection (e.g. `podman --remote exec -i foo cat <<<\"hello\"`) ([#7360](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7360)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with `--rm` were not immediately removed after being started by `podman start` if they failed to start ([#10935](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10935)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--storage-opt` flag to `podman create` and `podman run` was nonfunctional ([#10264](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10264)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--device-cgroup-rule` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was nonfunctional ([#10302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10302)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--tls-verify` option to `podman manifest push` was nonfunctional.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman import` command could, in some circumstances, produce empty images ([#10994](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10994)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where images pulled using the `docker-daemon:` transport had the wrong registry (`localhost` instead of `docker.io/library`) ([#10998](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10998)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where operations that pruned images (`podman image prune` and `podman system prune`) would prune untagged images with children ([#10832](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10832)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where dual-stack networks created by `podman network create` did not properly auto-assign an IPv4 subnet when one was not explicitly specified ([#11032](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11032)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where port forwarding using the `rootlessport` port forwarder would break when a network was disconnected and then reconnected ([#10052](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10052)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would ignore user-specified SELinux policies for containers using the Kata OCI runtime, or containers using systemd as PID 1 ([#11100](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11100)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman containers created using `--net=host` would add an entry to `/etc/hosts` for the container's hostname pointing to `127.0.1.1` ([#10319](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10319)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman unpause --all` command would throw an error for every container that was not paused ([#11098](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11098)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where timestamps for the `since` and `until` filters using Unix timestamps with a nanoseconds portion could not be parsed ([#11131](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11131)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command would sometimes print the wrong path for the `slirp4netns` binary.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers joined to a CNI network would not have functional DNS when the host used systemd-resolved without the resolved stub resolver being enabled ([#11222](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11222)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` of rootless containers could sometimes break port forwarding to the container ([#11248](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11248)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where joining a container to a CNI network by ID and adding network aliases to this network would cause the container to fail to start ([#11285](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11285)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Containers included healthcheck information for all containers, even those that did not have a configured healthcheck.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers would fail to create containers with the `NetworkMode` parameter set to `default` ([#10569](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10569)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle healthcheck commands ([#10617](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10617)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Wait endpoint for Containers would always send an empty string error message when no error occurred.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Stats endpoint for Containers would not error when run on rootless containers on cgroups v1 systems (nonsensical results would be returned, as this configuration cannot be supportable).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Images omitted the `ContainerConfig` field ([#10795](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10795)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images was too strict when validating the `Content-Type` header, rejecting content that Docker would have accepted ([#11022](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11012)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Pull endpoint for Images could fail, but return a 200 status code, if an image name that could not be parsed was provided.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Pull endpoint for Images would continue to pull images after the client disconnected.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat List endpoint for Networks would fail for non-bridge (e.g. macvlan) networks ([#10266](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10266)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod List endpoint for Networks would return nil, instead of an empty list, when no networks were present ([#10495](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10495)).\r\n- The Compat and Libpod Logs endpoints for Containers now support the `until` query parameter ([#10859](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10859)).\r\n- The Compat Import endpoint for Images now supports the `platform`, `message`, and `repo` query parameters.\r\n- The Compat Pull endpoint for Images now supports the `platform` query parameter.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.22.3\r\n- Updated the containers/storage

These functions allow performing bitwise operations over data points in time series. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1541).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add `-remoteWrite.disablePathAppend` command-line flag, which can be used when custom `-remoteWrite.url` must be specified. For example, `./vmalert -disablePathAppend -remoteWrite.url='http://foo.bar/a/b/c?d=e'` would write data to `http://foo.bar/a/b/c?d=e` instead of `http://foo.bar/a/b/c?d=e/api/v1/write`. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1536).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `-promscrape.noStaleMarkers` command-line flag for disabling sending Prometheus stale markers for metrics from disappeared scrape targets. This option may be used for reducing memory usage when scraping big number of metrics with big number of labels and when stale markers aren't needed.\r\n* FEATURE: vmselect: add `-search.noStaleMarkers` command-line flag for disabling stale markers handling in queries. This may save some CPU time when the queried data doesn't contain stale markers.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: stop scrapers for deleted targets before starting scrapers for added targets. This should prevent from possible time series overlap when old targets are substituted by new targets (for example, during new deployment in Kubernetes). The overlap could lead to incorrect query results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1509).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: send Prometheus stale markers for the previously scraped metrics on failed scrapes like Prometheus does. See [this article](https://www.robustperception.io/staleness-and-promql).\r\n* BUGFIX: upgrade base Docker image from Alpine 3.14.0 to Alpine 3.14.1 . This fixes potential security issues - see [Alpine 3.14.1 release notes](https://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.14.1-released.html).\r\n* BUGFIX: disable overriding the lookbehind window `[d]` at `last_over_time(m[d])` if `d` is smaller than the interval between samples, since users don't expect implicit overriding of explicitly set `[d]` in `last_over_time(m[d])`.\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2021-08-19T07:31:48Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.5", "tag_name": "v1.0.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.0.5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform", "body": "## 1.0.5 (August 18, 2021)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* json-output: Add an output change summary message as part of the `terraform plan -json` structured logs, bringing this format into parity with the human-readable UI.

This helps with release automation and more\r\nconsistent release schedule.\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * New Prometheus metrics for alarms:\r\n   * `rabbitmq_alarms_file_descriptor_limit` 1|0\r\n   * `rabbitmq_alarms_free_disk_space_watermark` 1|0\r\n   * `rabbitmq_alarms_memory_used_watermark` 1|0\r\n   \r\n   While some of the alarms have cluster-wide effect, these metrics are node-local.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2653](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2653)\r\n\r\n * Nodes will now use four more environment variables, if set: `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` (overrides `default_user` in `rabbitmq.conf`), `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` (overrides `default_pass`), `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST` (overrides `default_vhost`) and `RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE` (sets [shared authentication secret value](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#erlang-cookie)).\r\n   These variables **are not recommended to be used in production** but can be the only realistic option in some environment, such as service containers, ECS, and so on.\r\n   Most users should continue using `rabbitmq.conf` and a securely generated local cookie file.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3299](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3299)\r\n\r\n * Definitions now can be imported from different sources, including those provided by plugins. Original local filesystem source is still supported in a backwards-compatible way.\r\n\r\n   The following `rabbitmq.conf` example uses a local file as the source:\r\n   \r\n   ``` ini\r\n   #

= local_filesystem\r\n\r\n   definitions.local.path = /path/to/rabbitmq/definitions.d\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In this example config file, definitions are loaded from a URL accessible over HTTPS:\r\n

([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- For helm based operators, added a predicate that filters resources based on selectors specified in `watches.yaml`. Only the resources that contain the labels specified by selectors will be reconciled. ([#4997](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4997))\n- For helm-based operators, support go `text/template` expansion of override values. ([#5105](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5105))\n\n### Changes\n\n- (go/v3) Fixed a bug in `make test` caused by incorrect envtest asset setup. ([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- (go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Increased resource limits for controller manager. ([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- Updated operator-framework dependency to 0.10.5. This specific update includes a fix for bundle validation when checking for invalid service accounts. ([#5119](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5119))\n- For helm-based operators, reverted #5042 and #4937  which modified helm release equality comparison. ([#5097](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5097))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- (ansible/v1) Previously, when scaffolding an Ansible-based operator with both Roles and Playbooks, the roles imported by the playbook could not be found when running locally (`make run`). This change prepends the `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` environment variable with the path to the local roles directory. ([#5118](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5118))\n- For Ansible-based operators, if a request is sent without a body in the metadata it will now be extracted from the request URL and properly set owner references/dependent watches. ([#5064](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5064))\n- In `generate bundle`, exclude ServiceAccounts already in a CSV from generated bundle.

Renaming of some net-kourier components\r\n\r\nRelated issue: [knative/networking#448](https://github.com/knative/networking/issues/448)\r\n\r\nAs part of our efforts to GA/1.0 we've standardized on the naming of our networking plugins that are installed along side Serving. If you're managing your Knative deployment manually with kubectl this will require a two-phase upgrade process. In order to upgrade [net-kourier to v0.25.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/releases/tag/v0.25.0) using `kubectl` please follow the steps:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Apply the new release\r\n$ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml\r\n\r\n# Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but \r\n# prune the old resources\r\n$ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml \\\r\n  --prune -l networking.knative.dev/ingress-provider=kourier\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Disabling namespace certificate provisioning legacy label\r\n\r\nThe namespace label `networking.internal.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert` has been deprecated since v0.15.0 release in favour of `networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert`. We have dropped support for this legacy label. ([#11626](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11626), [@nak3](https://github.com/nak3))\r\n\r\n \r\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n- A feature flag is available to enable priorityClassName for Knative Services. See config-features for details. ([#11746](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11746), [@nealhu](https://github.com/nealhu))\r\n- Add memory metrics for HPA: `hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev` ([#11668](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11668), [@zhaojizhuang](https://github.com/zhaojizhuang))\r\n- Added `app.kubernetes.io/name` labels to resources. It will be replacing app labels in the future. ([#11655](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11655), [@upodroid](https://github.com/upodroid))\r\n- `Containers[*].securityContext.runAsNonRoot` can be set to true without a feature flag ([#11606](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11606), [@senthilnathan](https://github.com/senthilnathan))\r\n- Users can set `spec.template.spec.automountServiceAccountToken` to `false` in a PodSpec in order to opt-out of Kubenetes' default behaviour of mounting a ServiceAccount token in that Pod's containers. ([#11723](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11723), [@psschwei](https://github.com/psschwei))\r\n- Add v1beta1 version of DomainMapping crd ([#11682](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11682), [@julz](https://github.com/julz))\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1e Bug Fixes\r\n- Set `ENABLE_HTTP2_AUTO_DETECTION` to `false` by default if the feature is not enabled.

[#33510](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/33510)\r\n\r\n## Important Notes\r\n\r\nThis release addresses a regression in Rancher 2.4.16 that prevents users from uploading etcd snapshots to S3 on RKE clusters.\r\n\r\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to Rancher 2.4.17 since there is no existing workaround for Rancher 2.4.16 clusters.\r\n\r\n- **Please review the [v2.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.4.0) for important updates/ breaking changes.**\r\n\r\n* **Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version [[#25117](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25117)]** - Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version. Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup.\r\n\r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper`.\r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied.\r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster.\r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Worker nodes are now upgraded in batches. Please refer to the [RKE documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/upgrades/maintaining-availability/) about how to upgrade clusters without downtime for applications.\r\n\r\n- **Restrict Kubernetes versions in Rancher helm chart to versions less than 1.20.0 [[#30746](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30746)]** - This restriction was added to prevent Rancher from being installed on incompatible versions of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Air Gap Installations and Upgrades\r\n\r\nIn v2.4.0, an air gap installation no longer requires mirroring the systems chart git repo. Please follow the directions on how to [install Rancher to use the packaged systems chart](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/installation/air-gap/install-rancher).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]\r\n- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\"API Server Request Rate\"_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]\r\n- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue.

The custom `UnmarshalJSON()` will now fail if the input has unknown fields. #4298\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage. No new features will be added to the chunks storage. The default Cortex configuration still runs the chunks engine; please check out the [blocks storage doc](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/) on how to configure Cortex to run with the blocks storage.  #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] The example Kubernetes manifests (stored at `k8s/`) have been removed due to a lack of proper support and maintenance. #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: deprecated `-store.query-chunk-limit` CLI flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`) in favour of `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`). The new limit specifies the maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query from ingesters and long-term storage: the total number of actual fetched chunks could be 2x the limit, being independently applied when querying ingesters and long-term storage. #4125\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: allowed to configure the experimental receivers firewall on a per-tenant basis. The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been changed and moved to the limits config section: #4143\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-cidr-networks`\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-private-addresses`\r\n* [CHANGE] Change default value of `-server.grpc.keepalive.min-time-between-pings` from `5m` to `10s` and `-server.grpc.keepalive.ping-without-stream-allowed` to `true`. #4168\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change default value of `-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` to `true`. This incurs a small increase in memory usage, between 1.2% and 1.6% as measured on ingesters with 1.3M active series. #4257\r\n* [CHANGE] Dependency: update go-redis from v8.2.3 to v8.9.0. #4236\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max series per query limit is enforced in the querier and applies to unique series received from ingesters and store-gateway (long-term storage). #4179\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier/Ruler: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max chunk bytes limit is enforced in the querier and ruler and limits the size of all aggregated chunks returned from ingesters and storage as bytes for a query. #4216\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: support negative matchers, time-based muting - [upstream release notes](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.22.0). #4237\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added rate-limits to notifiers. Rate limits used by all integrations can be configured using `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit`, while per-integration rate limits can be specified via `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration` parameter. Both shared and per-integration limits can be overwritten using overrides mechanism. These limits are applied on individual (per-tenant) alertmanagers. Rate-limited notifications are failed notifications. It is possible to monitor rate-limited notifications via new `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total` metric. #4135 #4163\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes` limit to control size of configuration files that Cortex users can upload to Alertmanager via API. This limit is configurable per-tenant. #4201\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-templates-count` and `-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes` options to control number and size of templates uploaded to Alertmanager via API. These limits are configurable per-tenant. #4223\r\n* [FEATURE] Added flag `-debug.block-profile-rate` to enable goroutine blocking events profiling. #4217\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: The experimental sharding feature is now considered complete. Detailed information about the configuration options can be found [here for alertmanager](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) and [here for the alertmanager storage](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_storage_config). To use the feature: #3925 #4020 #4021 #4031 #4084 #4110 #4126 #4127 #4141 #4146 #4161 #4162 #4222\r\n  * Ensure that a remote storage backend is configured for Alertmanager to store state using `-alertmanager-storage.backend`, and flags related to the backend. Note that the `local` and `configdb` storage backends are not supported.\r\n  * Ensure that a ring store is configured using `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store`, and set the flags relevant to the chosen store type.\r\n  * Enable the feature using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`.\r\n  * Note the prior addition of a new configuration option `-alertmanager.persist-interval`. This sets the interval between persisting the current alertmanager state (notification log and silences) to object storage. See the [configuration file reference](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) for more information.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Cleanup persisted state objects from remote storage when a tenant configuration is deleted. #4167\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Added the ability to disable Open Census within GCS client (e.g `-gcs.enable-opencensus=false`). #4219\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Etcd: Added username and password to etcd config. #4205\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: introduced new metrics to monitor operation when using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`: #4149\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_completed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: support ingesting exemplars and querying of exemplars.  Enabled by setting new CLI flag `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-exemplars=<n>` or config option `blocks_storage.tsdb.max_exemplars` to positive value. #4124 #4181\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added distributors ring status section in the admin page. #4151\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added zone-awareness support to alertmanager for use when sharding is enabled. When zone-awareness is enabled, alerts will be replicated across availability zones. #4204\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `tenant_ids` tag to tracing spans #4186\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring, query-frontend: Avoid using automatic private IPs (APIPA) when discovering IP address from the interface during the registration of the instance in the ring, or by query-frontend when used with query-scheduler. APIPA still used as last resort with logging indicating usage. #4032\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: introduced new metrics to aid troubleshooting tombstone convergence: #4231\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones_removed_total`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_messages_to_broadcast_dropped_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups` option to control max number of active dispatcher groups in Alertmanager (per tenant, also overrideable). When the limit is reached, Dispatcher produces log message and increases `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_group_limit_reached_total` metric. #4254\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-alerts-count` and `-alertmanager.max-alerts-size-bytes` to control max number of alerts and total size of alerts that a single user can have in Alertmanager's memory. Adding more alerts will fail with a log message and incrementing `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_insert_limited_total` metric (per-user). These limits can be overrided by using per-tenant overrides. Current values are tracked in `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts` and `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts_size_bytes` metrics. #4253\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` and `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-max-duration` support to store-gateway, to wait for ring stability at startup. #4271\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added `rule_group` label to metrics `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_total` and `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total`. #4121\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added new metrics for tracking total number of queries and push requests sent to ingester, as well as failed queries and push requests. Failures are only counted for internal errors, but not user-errors like limits or invalid query.

"https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.18.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour", "body": "We are delighted to present version v1.18.0 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\nA big thank you to everyone who contributed to the release.\r\n\r\n# Major Changes\r\n\r\n## ExternalName Services changes\r\n\r\nKubernetes Services of type `ExternalName` will now not be processed by Contour without active action by Contour's operator. This prevents a vulnerability where an attacker with access to create Service objects inside a cluster running Contour could force Contour's Envoy to expose its own admin interface to the internet with a Service with an ExternalName of `localhost` or similar.\r\n\r\nWith access to Envoy's admin page, an attacker can force Envoy to restart or drain connections (which will cause Kubernetes to restart it eventually). The attacker can also see the names and metadata of TLS Secrets, *but not their contents*.\r\n\r\nThis version includes two main changes:\r\n- ExternalName Service processing is now disabled by default, and must be enabled.\r\n- Even when processing is enabled, obvious attempts to expose `localhost` will be prevented. This is quite a porous control, and should not be relied on as your sole means of mitigation.\r\n\r\nIn short, we recommend migration away from ExternalName Services as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n### I currently use ExternalName Services, what do I need to do?\r\n\r\nIf you are currently using ExternalName Services with your Contour installation, it's still recommended that you update to this version.\r\n\r\nHowever, as part of updating, you will need to add the `enableExternalNameService: \"true\"` directive to your Contour configuration file. This is not recommended for general use, because of the concerns above, but we have but some mitigations in place to stop *obvious* misuse of ExternalName Services if you *must* have them enabled.\r\n\r\nNote that because of the cross-namespace control issues documented at kubernetes/kubernetes#103675, you should definitely consider if you can move away from using ExternalName Services in any production clusters.\r\n\r\nThe ability to enable ExternalName Services for Contour is provided to help with migration, it is *not recommended* for use in production clusters.\r\n\r\n## Gateway API Improvements\r\n\r\n### GatewayClass and Gateway deletion\r\n\r\nContour 1.18.0 ensures when a GatewayClass or Gateway is deleted, it is removed from Contour's cache and DAG.\r\nRoutes programmed in Envoy are properly removed as well.\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3923](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3923) : internal/controller: fix Gateway/GatewayClass deletion bug\r\n\r\n### GatewayClass with non-nil Spec.ParametersRef handling\r\n\r\nPreviously Contour would not admit GatewayClasses with a non-nil Spec.ParametersRef.\r\nThis release ensures these GatewayClasses are still reconciled (Spec.ParametersRef is ignored).\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3876](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3876) : internal/validation: allow GatewayClass.Spec.ParametersRef to be specified\r\n\r\n## Secrets used for upstream TLS validation can be delegated across namespaces\r\n\r\nPreviously Contour would not allow a secret referenced in HTTPProxy upstream validation to reside in a different namespace from the HTTPProxy object itself.\r\nThis release includes a change to allow users to utilize TLS certificate delegation to relax this restriction.\r\nUsers will now be able to create a TLSCertificateDelegation object to allow the owner of the CA certificate secret to delegate, for the purposes of referencing the CA certificate in a different namespace, permission to Contour to read the Secret object from another namespace.\r\nYou may want to take advantage of this feature to consolidate secrets in a management namespace and delegate their usage to an app namespace containing the relevant HTTPProxy.\r\n\r\nThanks to @shashankram for implementing this feature!\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3894](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3894) : internal/dag: allow delegation of upstream validation CACertificate\r\n\r\n## IngressClassName field added to HTTPProxy\r\n\r\nTo ensure forwards-compatibility with k8s standards around Ingress, Contour has added the Spec.IngressClassName field, to mimic the similar Ingress object field.\r\nHTTPProxy objects could previously be filtered via [annotation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.18.0/config/annotations/#ingress-class) but now will also be filtered using the same rules as Ingress objects, taking into account the Spec field.\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3902](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3902) : HTTPProxy: add Spec.IngressClassName\r\n\r\n## Access Logging Enhancements\r\n\r\nThe Envoy text access log format string can now be customized via the `accesslog-format-string` field in the Contour config file.\r\nIn addition, the `REQ_WITHOUT_QUERY` access logging extension is enabled in Contour, which allows logging of a request path with any query string stripped.\r\n*Note* that using this command operator extension requires Envoy 1.19.0.\r\nSee [this documentation page](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.18.0/config/access-logging/) for more details.\r\n\r\nThanks to @tsaarni for contributing this feature and documentation!\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3694](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3694) : internal/envoy: configurable access log format\r\n- [#3849](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3849) : site: Added versioned access logging document\r\n- [#3921](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3921) : site: update access logging links\r\n\r\n## Envoy Updated to 1.19.0\r\n\r\nContour 1.18.0 is compatible with Envoy 1.19.0. For more information, see the Contour compatibility matrix.\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3887](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3887) : update Envoy to 1.19.0\r\n\r\n## Documentation Working Group Contributions\r\n\r\nThanks to @gary-tai for helping clean up the project site.\r\n\r\nRelevant PRs:\r\n- [#3913](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3913) : Kindly running post - fix broken links\r\n- [#3919](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3919) : Blog updates - fix 2 blog posts for broken image links\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\n\r\nPlease consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n## Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.18.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.19 through 1.21\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

**performance improvements** for evaluating partial sets and objects,\r\nand introduces a new ABI call to OPA's Wasm modules to speed up Wasm evaluations.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with an improvement for checking policies -- unsafe declared variables are now caught at compile time.\r\nThis means that **some policies** that have been working fine with previous versions, because their unsafe variables\r\nhad not ever been queried, will fail to compile with OPA 0.31.0.\r\nSee below for details and what to do about that.\r\n\r\n### Spotlights\r\n\r\n#### Partial Sets and Objects Performance\r\n\r\nResolving an issue ([#822](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/822)) created on July 4th 2018,\r\nOPA can now cache the results of partial sets and partial objects.\r\n\r\nA benchmark that accesses a partial set of increasing size _twice_ shows a saving of more than 50%:\r\n\r\n    name                             old time/op    new time/op    delta\r\n

policy of\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nfixture[x] {\r\n\tx := numbers.range(1, n)[_]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere `n` is 10, 100, or 1000.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple access patterns that are accounted for: if a _ground_ scalar is used to\r\naccess a previously not-cached partial rule,\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nallow {\r\n\tmanagers[input.user] # here\r\n}\r\n\r\nmanagers[x] {\r\n\t# some logic here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe evaluation algorithm will calculate the set membership of `input.user` _only_, and cache the result.\r\n\r\nIf there is a query that requires evaluating the entire partial, however, the algorithm will also cache the entire partial:\r\n```rego\r\nallow {\r\n\tsome person\r\n\tmanagers[person]\r\n\t# more expressions\r\n}\r\n\r\nmanagers[x] {\r\n\t# some logic here\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthus avoiding extra evaluations later on.\r\nThe same is true if `managers` was used as a fully materialized set in an execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also means that the question about whether to write\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nq = { x | ... } # set comprehension\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```rego\r\nq[x] { ... } # partial set rule\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes much less important for policy evaluation performance.\r\n\r\n#### WebAssembly Performance\r\n\r\nOPA-generated Wasm modules have gotten a fast-path evaluation method:\r\nBy calling the one-off function\r\n\r\n    opa_eval(reserved, entrypoint, data_addr, input_addr, input_len, format)\r\n\r\nwhich returns a pointer to the serialized result set (in JSON if format is 0, \"value\" format if 1),\r\nthe number of VM calls needed for evaluating a policy via Wasm is drastically reduced.\r\n\r\nThe performance benefit is huge:\r\n\r\n    name         old time/op    new time/op    delta\r\n    WasmRego-16    84.3\u00b5s \u00b1 6%    15.1\u00b5s \u00b1 0%  -82.07%  (p=0.008 n=5+5)\r\n\r\nThe added `opa_eval` export comes with an ABI bump to version 1.2.\r\nSee [#3627](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3627) for all details.\r\n\r\nAlong the same line, we've examined the processing of query evaluations that are Wasm-backed _through the `rego` package_.\r\nThis allowed us to avoid unneccessary work ([#3666](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3666)).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Unsafe declared variables now cause a compile-time error\r\n\r\nBefore this release, local variables that had been _declared_, i.e. introduced via the `some` keyword, had been able\r\nto slip through the safety checks unnoticed.\r\n\r\nFor example, a policy like\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage demo\r\n\r\nq { \r\n\tinput == \"open sesame\"\r\n}\r\n\r\np[x] {\r\n\tsome x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould have _not_ caused any error **if `data.demo.p` wasn't queried**.\r\nQuerying `data.demo.p` would return an \"var requires evaluation\" error.\r\n\r\nWith this release, the erroneous rule no longer goes unnoticed, but is **caught at compile time**: \"var x is unsafe\".\r\n\r\nThe most likely fix is to remove the rule with the unsafe variable, since it cannot have contributed to a successful\r\nevaluation in previous OPA versions.\r\n\r\nSee [#3580](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3580) for details.\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- New built-in function: `crypto.x509.parse_and_verify_certificates` ([#3601](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3601)), authored by @[jalseth](https://github.com/jalseth)\r\n\r\n  This function enables you to verify that there is a chain from a leaf certificate back to the trusted root.\r\n- New built-in function: `rand.intn` generates a random number between `0` and `n` ([#3615](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3615)), authored by @[base698](https://github.com/base698)\r\n\r\n  The function takes a string argument to ensure that the same call, within one policy evaluation, returns the same random number.\r\n- `http.send` enhancement: New `caching_mode` parameter to configure if deserialized or serialized response bodies should be cached ([#3599](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3599)) \r\n- Custom built-in function enhancement: let custom builtins halt evaluation ([#3534](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3534))\r\n- Partial evaluation: Fix stack overflow on certain expressions ([#3559](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3559))\r\n\r\n### Tooling\r\n\r\n- Query Profiling: `opa eval --profile` now supports a `--count=#` flag to gather metrics and profiling data over multiple runs, and displays aggregate statistics for the results ([#3651](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3651)).\r\n\r\n  This allows you to gather more robust numbers to assess policy performance.\r\n\r\n- Docker images: Publish static image ([#3633](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3633))\r\n\r\n  As of this release, you can use the staticly-built Linux binary from a docker image: `openpolicyagent/opa:0.31.0-static`.\r\n  It contains the same binary that has been published since release v0.29.4, statically linked to musl, with evaluating Wasm disabled.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Built-in `http.send`: ignore `tls_use_system_certs` setting on Windows. Having this set to _true_ (the default as of v0.29.0) would _always_ return an error on Windows.\r\n- The console decision logger is no longer tied to the general log level ([#3654](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3654))\r\n- Update query compiler to reject empty queries ([#3625](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3625))\r\n- Partial Evaluation fix: Don't generate comprehension with unsafe variables ([#3557](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3557))\r\n- Parser: modules containing _only_ tabs and spaces no longer lead to a runtime panic.\r\n- Wasm: ensure that the desired stack space for the C library calls (64KiB) is not reduced by data segments added in the compiler.\r\n   This is achieved by putting the stack first -- stack overflows now become \"out of bounds\" memory access traps.\r\n   Before, it would silently corrupt the static data.\r\n\r\n### Server and Runtime\r\n\r\n- New configuration for Management APIs: using `resource`, the request path for sending decision logs can be configured now ([#3618](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3618)), authored by @[cbuto](https://github.com/cbuto)\r\n\r\n  `/logs` is still the default, but can now be overridden.\r\n  With this change, the `partition_name` config becomes deprecated, since its functionality is subsumed by this new configurable.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- How to debug? Clarify how to access `Note` events for debugging via explanations ([#3628](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3628)) authored by @[enori](https://github.com/enori)\r\n- Clarify special characters for key, i.e. what `x[\"y\"]` is necessary because `x.y` isn't valid ([#3638](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3638)) authored by @[Hongbo-Miao](https://github.com/Hongbo-Miao)\r\n- Management APIs: Remove deprecated fields from docs\r\n- Policy Reference: add missing backtick; `type_name` builtin is natively implemented in Wasm", "created_at": "2021-07-28T07:11:37Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.2.18", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/commit/52857ccac9d315a6e1897c7885f463983ac67957", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant", "body": "Release 2.2.18", "created_at": "2021-07-27T16:16:42Z", "project": "Vagrant", "repo": "hashicorp/vagrant", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess 11.0.0", "tag_name": "v11.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v11.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "This release complies with VEP-3 which removes the upgrade order requirement.

This allows for pipeline and reader specific configuration. Implements HTTP transport configuration options. These options allows for more fine-grained control on timeouts and retries. Implements MSI authentication as second method of authentication via a service principal token.\r\n- [#4406](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4406) Tools: Add retention command for applying retention policy on the bucket.\r\n- [#4430](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4430) Compact: Add flag `downsample.concurrency` to specify the concurrency of downsampling blocks.\r\n- [#4231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4231) Receive: Implemented the [receive dual-mode](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/release-0.22/docs/proposals-accepted/202012-receive-split.md). This means that it is now you can run receive as ingester (TSDB only, no hashring awareness), as router (no TSDB, only forwarding mode) and old mode (router + ingester) in one service. Consider splitting functionality if you want to scale your hashring into multiple rings or you want horizontally autoscale your ingester more often.\r\n- [#3678](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3678) UI: add support for new duration format in graph range input. Now it is possible to use composite durations such as `5m30s`.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- [#4384](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4384) Fix the experimental PromQL editor when used on multiple line.\r\n- [#4342](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4342) ThanosSidecarUnhealthy doesn't fire if the sidecar is never healthy\r\n- [#4388](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4388) Receive: fix bug in forwarding remote-write requests within the hashring via gRPC when TLS is enabled on the HTTP server but not on the gRPC server.\r\n- [#4340](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4340) UI: now displays the duration and all annotations of an alert in the alerts page.\r\n- [#4348](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4348) Fixed parsing of the port in the log middleware.\r\n- [#4417](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4417) UI: fixed the night mode in Bucket UI.\r\n- [#4442](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4442) Ruler: fix SIGHUP reload signal not working.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#4354](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4354) Receive: use the S2 library for decoding Snappy data; saves about 5-7% of CPU time in the Receive component when handling incoming remote write requests\r\n- [#4369](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4354) Build: Pin upgrade Alpine's version.\r\n- [#4404](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4404) Receive: added extra validation for the tenant's label name.

This release also includes enhancements to improve the user experience and fixes for bugs reported by users and E2E tools. There has been some significant progress made on the alpha features as well. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n- Enhanced [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl/blob/develop/README.md) to provide additional information about OpenEBS storage components like: \r\n  - Block devices managed by OpenEBS  (`kubectl openebs get bd`)\r\n  - Jiva Volumes \r\n  - LVM Local PV Volumes\r\n  - ZFS Local PV Volumes\r\n- Added a new Stateful workload dashboard to [Monitoring helm chart](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) to display the CPU, RAM and Filesystem stats of a given Pod. This dashboard currently supports fetching details for LVM Local PV. In addition new alert rules related to PVC status are supported. \r\n- Enhanced [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) snapshot support by allowing users to configure the size that should be reserved for LVM snapshots. By default, the size reserved for a snapshot is equal to the size of the volume. In cases, where snapshots are created for backup purposes, the snapshots may not require the entire space. This feature helps in creating snapshots on VGs that don't have enough space to reserve full capacity for snapshots. \r\n- Enhanced the way custom topology keys can be specified for [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv). Prior to this enhancement, LVM driver would load the topology keys from node labels and cache them and if someone modified the labels and missed to restart the driver pods, there could be an impact to volume scheduling. This enhancement requires users to specify the topology key via ENV allowing users to know the current key and if there is a change, requires for a ENV modification that will force a restart of all the drivers.\r\n- [NFS Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) has been updated with several new features like:\r\n  - Ability to configure the LeaseTime and GraceTime for the NFS server to tune the restart times\r\n  - Added a prometheus metrics end point to report volume creation and failure events \r\n  - Added a configuration option to allow users to specify the GUID to set on the NFS server to allow non-root applications to access NFS share\r\n  - Allow specifying a different namespace than provisioner namespace to create NFS volume related objects\r\n  - Allow specifying the node affinity for NFS server deployment\r\n- [Rawfile Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) has been enhanced to support xfs filesystem.\r\n- Enhanced Jiva and cStor CSI drivers to handle split brain condition that could cause the Kubelet to attach the volume on new node while still mounted on disconnected node. The CSI drivers have been enhanced to allow iSCSI login connection only from one node at any given time. \r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue in Jiva Volume Replica STS keeps crashing due to change in the cluster domain and failed attempts to access the controller.\r\n- Fixed an issue in Jiva Volume that was causing log flooding while fetching volume status using Service DNS. Switched to using controller IP. \r\n- Fixed an issue in ZFS Local Volumes that was causing an intermittent crash of controller pod due erroneously accessing a variable.\r\n- Fixed an issue in Device Local PV causing a crash due to a race condition between creating partition and clearing a partition.\r\n- Several usability fixes to documentation and helm charts for various engines. \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n- Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v2.11.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugmayastor.html) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 2.11.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 2.11.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.7.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.4.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Jiva](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/jiva.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-hostpath.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-device.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [cStor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/cstor.html) 2.11.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.5.0 (alpha)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.6.0 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- A E2e CI Dashboard is being developed to show the status of pipelines being run on various engines. (https://openebs.ci)\r\n- The OpenEBS Website and Documentation sites are being redesigned for a new look and feel - in preparation for 3.0 release.

In v1.1.2, the problem is resolved by introducing the idempotent operation to ensure volumes detach and attach successfully.\r\n- [Ensure recurring jobs run again when the volume is attached after being detached for a long time](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2513)\r\n  - Before v1.1.2, the recurring job depends on CronJob design, so during the volume detachment, if there are more than 100 missed schedules, then it does not start the job [[ref]([CronJob limitations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#cron-job-limitations))]. In v1.1.2, the problem is resolved by reactivating the recurring job when the volume gets attached every time.\r\n- [Improve replica rebuilding speed](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2507)\r\n  - In 1.1.2, speeding up replica rebuilding is by improving the performance of replica file extent retrieval by adopting the concurrent processing way instead of iterative retrieval. This can bring us several times of improvement. [[ref](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2507#issuecomment-866550145)]\r\n- [Deprecate Volume Attachement Recovery policy](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2060)\r\n  - Before v1.1.2, Longhorn can manage volume attachment in different cases, but this function conflicts with the Pod Deletion Policy feature which lets kubelet handle the volume attachment lifecycle instead. To avoid this needless possible conflicting behavior, it is deprecated in v1.1.2.\r\n- And more, please check the below list.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher catalog, Kubectl, and Helm.

The role kubernetes/master has been renamed to kubernetes/control-plane, if using the role kubernetes/master solely on previous Kubespray, it is necessary to update the specified role.\r\n2. The role recover_control_plane/master has been renamed to recover_control_plane/control-plane. If using the role recover_control_plane/master solely on previous Kubespray, it is necessary to update the specified role.\r\n3. inventory_builder starts referring the environment variable KUBE_CONTROL_HOSTS to get the number of control-plane nodes, it still refers KUBE_MASTERS but it will be not referred after some deprecation cycles. **Please specify KUBE_CONTROL_HOSTS if now specifying KUBE_MASTERS**\r\n4. You can enable control plane certificates automatic renewal using `auto_renew_certificates`, or manually use k8s-certs-renew.sh `force_certificate_regeneration` is removed as it was only renewing the api server certs and not all the other ones\r\n5. The inventory group *kube-master* has been renamed to *kube_control_plane*. Please update your inventory file by replacing *kube-master* if continuing to use the existing inventory file.\r\n6. New vars for configuring kube-scheduler were introduced (including extenders and profiles). Default vaules can be found at roles/kubernetes/control-plane/defaults/main/kube-scheduler.yml\r\n7. Ansible groups were updated to be more consistent with dynamic inventory plugins: k8s-cluster -> k8s_cluster / k8s-node -> k8s_node / calico-rr -> calico_rr / no-floating -> no_floating",

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
