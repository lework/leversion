These are intended for easing the use of Podman on OS X by handling the creation of a Linux VM for running Podman.\r\n- The `podman generate kube` command can now be run on Podman named volumes (generating `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML), in addition to pods and containers.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports two new options, `--ip` and `--mac`, to set static IPs and MAC addresses for created pods ([#8442](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8442) and [#9731](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9731)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command's support for `PersistentVolumeClaim` YAML has been greatly improved.\r\n- The `podman generate kube` command now preserves the label used by `podman auto-update` to identify containers to update as a Kubernetes annotation, and the `podman play kube` command will convert this annotation back into a label. This allows `podman auto-update` to be used with containers created by `podman play kube`.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes `secretRef` YAML (using the secrets support from `podman secret`) for environment variables.\r\n- Secrets can now be added to containers as environment variables using the `type=env` option to the `--secret` flag to `podman create` and `podman run`.\r\n- The `podman start` command now supports the `--all` option, allowing all containers to be started simultaneously with a single command. The `--filter` option has also been added to filter which containers to start when `--all` is used.\r\n- Filtering containers with the `--filter` option to `podman ps` and `podman start` now supports a new filter, `restart-policy`, to filter containers based on their restart policy.\r\n- The `--group-add` option to rootless `podman run` and `podman create` now accepts a new value, `keep-groups`, which instructs Podman to retain the supplemental groups of the user running Podman in the created container. This is only supported with the `crun` OCI runtime.\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--timeout`. This sets a maximum time the container is allowed to run, after which it is killed ([#6412](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6412)).\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--pidfile`. This will create a file when the container is started containing the PID of the first process in the container.\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support a new option, `--requires`. The `--requires` option adds dependency containers - containers that must be running before the current container. Commands like `podman start` will automatically start the requirements of a container before starting the container itself.\r\n- Auto-updating containers can now be done with locally-built images, not just images hosted on a registry, by creating containers with the `io.containers.autoupdate` label set to `local`.\r\n- Podman now supports the [Container Device Interface](https://github.com/container-orchestrated-devices/container-device-interface) (CDI) standard.\r\n- Podman now adds an entry to `/etc/hosts`, `host.containers.internal`, pointing to the current gateway (which, for root containers, is usually a bridge interface on the host system) ([#5651](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5651)).\r\n- The `podman ps`, `podman pod ps`, `podman network list`, `podman secret list`, and `podman volume list` commands now support a `--noheading` option, which will cause Podman to omit the heading line including column names.\r\n- The `podman unshare` command now supports a new flag, `--rootless-cni`, to join the rootless network namespace. This allows commands to be run in the same network environment as rootless containers with CNI networking.\r\n- The `--security-opt unmask=` option to `podman run` and `podman create` now supports glob operations to unmask a group of paths at once (e.g. `podman run --security-opt unmask=/proc/* ...` will unmask all paths in `/proc` in the container).\r\n- The `podman network prune` command now supports a `--filter` option to filter which networks will be pruned.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The change in Podman 3.1.2 where the `:z` and `:Z` mount options for volumes were ignored for privileged containers has been reverted after discussion in [#10209](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10209).\r\n- Podman's rootless CNI functionality no longer requires a sidecar container! The removal of the requirement for the `rootless-cni-infra` container means that rootless CNI is now usable on all architectures, not just AMD64, and no longer requires pulling an image ([#8709](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8709)).\r\n- The Image handling code used by Podman has seen a major rewrite to improve code sharing with our other projects, Buildah and CRI-O. This should result in fewer bugs and performance gains in the long term. Work on this is still ongoing.\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command now prunes previous versions of images after updating if they are unused, to prevent disk exhaustion after repeated updates ([#10190](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10190)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` now treats environment variables configured as references to a `ConfigMap` as mandatory unless the `optional` parameter was set; this better matches the behavior of Kubernetes.\r\n- Podman now supports the `--context=default` flag from Docker as a no-op for compatibility purposes.\r\n- When Podman is run as root, but without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being available, it will run in a user namespace using the same code as rootless Podman (instead of failing outright).\r\n- The `podman info` command now includes the path of the Seccomp profile Podman is using, available cgroup controllers, and whether Podman is connected to a remote service or running containers locally.\r\n- Containers created with the `--rm` option now automatically use the `volatile` storage flag when available for their root filesystems, causing them not to write changes to disk as often as they will be removed at completion anyways. This should result in improved performance.\r\n- The `podman generate systemd --new` command will now include environment variables referenced by the container in generated unit files if the value would be looked up from the system environment.\r\n- Podman now requires that Conmon v2.0.24 be available.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command did not support the `--arch`, `--platform`, and `--os`, options.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command ignored the `--rm=false` option ([#9869](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9869)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build --iidfile` command could include extra output (in addition to just the image ID) in the image ID file written ([#10233](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10233)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command did not preserve hardlinks when moving files into the container via `COPY` instructions ([#9893](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9893)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command could generate extra `--iidfile` arguments if the container was already created with one.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would generate unit files that did not include `RequiresMountsFor` lines ([#10493](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10493)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command produced incorrect YAML for containers which bind-mounted both `/` and `/root` from the host system into the container ([#9764](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9764)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where pods created by `podman play kube` from YAML that specified `ShareProcessNamespace` would only share the PID namespace (and not also the UTS, Network, and IPC namespaces) ([#9128](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9128)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman network reload` command could generate spurious error messages when `iptables-nft` was in use.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to attach to containers when the user running Podman had a large UID.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman ps` command could fail with a `no such container` error due to a race condition with container removal ([#10120](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10120)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers using the `slirp4netns` network mode and setting a custom `slirp4netns` subnet while using the `rootlesskit` port forwarder would not be able to forward ports ([#9828](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9828)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter ancestor=` option to `podman ps` did not require an exact match of the image name/ID to include a container in its results.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter until=` option to `podman image prune` would prune images created after the specified time (instead of before).\r\n- Fixed a bug where setting a custom Seccomp profile via the `seccomp_profile` option in `containers.conf` had no effect, and the default profile was used instead.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--cgroup-parent` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was ignored in rootless Podman on cgroups v2 systems with the `cgroupfs` cgroup manager ([#10173](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10173)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `IMAGE` and `NAME` variables in `podman container runlabel` were not being correctly substituted ([#10192](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10192)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could freeze when creating containers with a specific combination of volumes and working directory ([#10216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10216)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman containers restarted by restart policy (e.g. containers created with `--restart=always`) would lose networking after being restarted ([#8047](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8047)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command could not copy files into containers created with the `--pid=host` flag ([#9985](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9985)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where filters to the `podman events` command could not be specified twice (if a filter is specified more than once, it will match if any of the given values match - logical or) ([#10507](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10507)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would include IPv6 nameservers in `resolv.conf` in containers without IPv6 connectivity ([#10158](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10158)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers could not be created with static IP addresses when connecting to a network using the `macvlan` driver ([#10283](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10283)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not allow advanced network options to be set ([#10110](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10110)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers ignored static IP information provided in the `IPAMConfig` block ([#10245](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10245)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers returned null (instead of an empty list) for Networks when the container was not joined to a CNI network ([#9837](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9837)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Wait endpoint for Containers could miss containers exiting if they were immediately restarted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Volumes required that the user provide a name for the new volume ([#9803](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9803)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Info handler would sometimes not return the correct path to the Podman API socket.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Events handler used the wrong name for container exited events (`died` instead of `die`) ([#10168](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10168)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Push endpoint for Images could leak goroutines if the remote end closed the connection prematurely.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.21.0\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.38.5\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.31.3\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-06-03T18:11:02Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.4.0", "tag_name": "v0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.4.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint", "body": "## 0.4.0 (June 03, 2021)\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n* **Mutable Deployments**: Waypoint now supports the concept of \"mutable\" deployments\r\nwhere a deployment updates an existing resource rather than creating something\r\nnew.

Previously, it was GET. The POST APIs have been available since January 2018 (Prometheus 2.1.0) and they have fewer limitations than the GET APIs. For example, when dealing with high cardinality labels, GET hits the URL size limit. \n\nIf you have a Prometheus instance with version < 2.1.0, which uses the default HTTP method, update your HTTP method to GET.

See https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/3440 for additional information on TLSRoute feature requirements.\r\n\r\n### GatewayClass Support\r\nPR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3659 added GatewayClass support through the gateway.controllerName configuration parameter. The gateway.namespace and gateway.name parameters are required when setting gateway.controllerName. When the cluster contains Gateway API CRDs and this parameter is set, Contour will reconcile GatewayClass resources with the spec.controller field that matches gateway.controllerName. ControllerName should take the form of `projectcontour.io/<namespace>/contour`, where `<namespace>` is the namespace that Contour runs in.\r\n\r\n## CA is No Longer Ignored when Downstream \"Skip Verify\" is True\r\nWith PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3661, Contour will no longer ignore a certificate under the following conditions:\r\n  - If no CA is set and \"skip verify\" is true, client certs are not required by Envoy.\r\n  - If CA set and \"skip verify\" is true, client certs are required by Envoy.\r\n  - CA is still required if \"skip verify\" is false.\r\n  - `caCert` is now optional since skipClientCertValidation can be true. PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3658 added an `omitempty` JSON tag to omit the `caCert` field when serializing to JSON and it hasn't been specified.  \r\n\r\n## Website Update\r\nPR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3704 revamps the Contour website based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Check out the fresh new look and tell us what you think.\r\n\r\n# Deprecation & Removal Notices\r\n- PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3642 removed the `experimental-service-apis` flag has been removed. The gateway.name & gateway.namespace in the Contour configuration file should be used for configuring Gateway API (formerly Service APIs).\r\n- PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3645 removed support for Ingress v1beta1. Ingress v1 resources should be used with Contour.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\nPlease consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n## Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

"## v1.8.0\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added new bundle validator to check the bundle against the Community Operator criteria. For futher information run `operator-sdk bundle validate --list-optional` and `operator-sdk bundle validate --help`. This validator is in alpha and subject to breaking changes. ([#4939](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4939))\n- Added --extra-service-accounts flag to `generate bundle` to consider roles bound to service accounts not specified in the operator's Deployment. ([#4826](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4826))\n- Added the `quarkus/v1-alpha` Java plugin, which supports `init` and `create api` commands. This plugin is alpha and subject to breaking changes. ([#4871](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4871))\n- Add new optional flag `--skip-tls` to the commands `operator-sdk run bundle` and `operator-sdk run bundle-upgrade`. This option allows to install the operator from a bundle image stored at an insecure docker registry. (e.g. `operator-sdk run bundle localhost:5000/my-operator-bundle:latest --skip-tls`). ([#4816](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4816))\n\n### Changes\n\n- `generate bundle` adds ClusterRoles bound by RoleBindings to a CSV's `.spec.permissions`, since these become namespace-scoped at runtime. They will also be added to `.spec.clusterPermissions` if bound by a ClusterRoleBinding. ([#4826](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4826))\n- Images built from the operator-sdk repository for the latest two minor version's latest patch version will now be rebuilt whenever a constituent base image has a new patch version published. For example, running `docker pull quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator:v1.7.2` after a rebuild will result in a fully compatible, patched image. ([#4917](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4917))\n- (go/v3) Upgraded Go version to 1.16. ([#4927](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4927))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Bumped operator-framework/api to v0.8.1, which properly defaults a CRD conversion's service port to 443. ([#4903](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4903))\n- Detect and report ansible-runner binary failures early and prevent symliking to artifacts. ([#4944](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4944))\n- For Helm-based operators, fixed a bug where deployed and candidate release comparison was always false when an RNG was used to derive some manifest value, resulting in the chart release constantly upgrading. ([#4937](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4937))\n- Bumped operator-lib to v0.4.1 for several bugfixes in ansible-operator and helm-operator binaries. ([#4888](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4888))\n- Pinned pip3 to 21.1 in the ansible-operator image to fix https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/9827. ([#4877](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4877))\n- Pinned base images of ansible-operator to ubi:8.3-297.1618432833, and helm-operator and scorecard to ubi-minimal:8.3-298.1618432845.

This allows Boundary, by default, to have the admin UI and desktop\n  client work without further specification of origins by the operator. This is\n  only affecting default behavior; if `cors_enabled` is explicitly set to\n  `true`, the behavior will be the same as before. This had been changed in\n  v0.2.1 due to a bug found in v0.2.0 that caused all origins to always be\n  allowed, but fixing that bug exposed that the default behavior was difficult\n  for users to configure to simply get up and running.\n* If a `cancel` operation is run on a session already in a canceling or\n  terminated state, a `200` and the session information will be returned instead\n  of an error.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* sessions: Return a `200` and session information when canceling an\n  already-canceled or terminated session\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1243))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cors: Change the default allowed origins when `cors_enabled` is not specified\n  to be `*`.

See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/740) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#multitenancy).\r\n* FEATURE: vminsert: add support for data ingestion via other `vminsert` nodes. This allows building multi-level data ingestion paths in VictoriaMetrics cluster by writing data from one level of `vminsert` nodes to another level of `vminsert` nodes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multi-level-cluster-setup) and [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/541#issuecomment-835487858) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: reload `bearer_token_file`, `credentials_file` and `password_file` contents every second. This allows dynamically changing the contents of these files during target scraping and service discovery without the need to restart `vmagent`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1297).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add a flag to control behaviour on startup for state restore errors. Such errors were returned and logged before as well. Now user can specify whether to just log these errors (`-remoteRead.ignoreRestoreErrors=true`) or to stop the process (`-remoteRead.ignoreRestoreErrors=false`). The latter is important when VM isn't ready yet to serve queries from vmalert and it needs to wait. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1252).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to pass `round_digits` query arg to datasource via `-datasource.roundDigits` command-line flag. This can be used for limiting the number of decimal digits after the point in recording rule results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/525).\r\n* FEATURE: return `X-Server-Hostname` header in http responses of all the VictoriaMetrics components. This should simplify tracing the origin server behind a load balancer or behind auth proxy during troubleshooting.\r\n* FEATURE: vmselect: allow to use 2x more memory for query processing at `vmselect` nodes in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html). This should allow processing heavy queries without the need to increase RAM size at `vmselect` nodes.\r\n* FEATURE: add ability to filter `/api/v1/status/tsdb` output with arbitrary [time series selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) passed via `match[]` query args. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#tsdb-stats) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1168) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: automatically detect memory and cpu limits for VictoriaMetrics components running under [cgroup v2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) environments such as [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1269).\r\n* FEATURE: vmauth: allow `-auth.config` reloading via `/-/reload` http endpoint. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1194).\r\n* FEATURE: add `timezone_offset(tz)` function. It returns offset in seconds for the given timezone `tz` relative to UTC. This can be useful when combining with datetime-related functions. For example, `day_of_week(time()+timezone_offset(\"America/Los_Angeles\"))` would return weekdays for `America/Los_Angeles` time zone. Special `Local` time zone can be used for returning an offset for the time zone set on the host where VictoriaMetrics runs. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1306) and [MetricsQL docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) for more details.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add support for OAuth2 authorization for scrape targets and service discovery in the same way as Prometheus does. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#oauth2).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add support for OAuth2 authorization when writing data to `-remoteWrite.url`. See `-remoteWrite.oauth2.*` config params in `/path/to/vmagent -help` output.\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to set `extra_filter_labels` at alerting and recording group configs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#groups).\r\n* FEATURE: vmstorage: reduce memory usage by up to 30% when ingesting big number of active time series.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: do not retry scraping targets, which don't support HTTP. This should reduce CPU load and network usage at `vmagent` and at scrape target. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1289).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: fix possible race when refreshing `role: endpoints` and `role: endpointslices` scrape targets in `kubernetes_sd_config`. Prevoiusly `pod` objects could be updated after the related `endpoints` object update. This could lead to missing scrape targets. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1240).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: properly spread scrape targets among `vmagent` replicas if `-promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor` exceeds 1. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1292).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: limit `scrape_timeout` by `scrape_interval`. This guarantees that only a single sample is lost during the configured `scrape_interval` when scrape target responds slowly. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1281#issuecomment-840538907) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: properly remove stale parts outside the configured retention if `-retentionPeriod` is smaller than one month. Previously stale parts could remain active for up to a month after they go outside the retention.\r\n* BUGFIX: stop the process on panic errors, since such errors may leave the process in inconsistent state. Previously panics could be recovered, which could result in unexpected hard-to-debug further behavior of running process.\r\n* BUGFIX: vminsert, vmagent: make sure data ingestion connections are closed before completing graceful shutdown. Previously the connection may remain open, which could result in trailing samples loss.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmauth, vmalert: properly re-use HTTP keep-alive connections to backends and datasources. Previously only 2 keep-alive connections per backend could be re-used. Other connections were closed after the first request. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1300) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: fix false positive error `result contains metrics with the same labelset after applying rule labels`, which could be triggered when recording rules generate unique metrics. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1293).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmctl: properly import InfluxDB rows if they have a field and a tag with identical names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1299).\r\n* BUGFIX: properly reload configs if `SIGHUP` signal arrives during service initialization. Previously such `SIGHUP` signal could be ingonred and configs weren't reloaded.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: properly import default rules from OpenShift. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/243).\r\n* BUGFIX: reduce the probability of `the removal queue is full` panic when highly loaded VictoriaMetrics stores data on NFS. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1313).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2021-05-24T12:55:08Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.10.3", "tag_name": "v2.10.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/tag/v2.10.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver", "body": "## \u5feb\u901f\u5f00\u59cb\r\n\r\n\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u6b65\u5feb\u901f\u5b89\u88c5 JumpServer\uff1a\r\n\r\n1. \u51c6\u5907\u4e00\u53f0 2\u68384G \uff08\u6700\u4f4e\uff09\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7684 64 \u4f4d Linux \u4e3b\u673a\uff1b\r\n2. \u4ee5 root \u7528\u6237\u6267\u884c\u5982\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\u4e00\u952e\u5b89\u88c5 JumpServer\u3002\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\ncurl -sSL https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/download/v2.10.3/quick_start.sh | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\r\n\r\n- [\u5b89\u88c5\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357](https://jumpserver.readthedocs.io/zh/master/)\r\n\r\n## \u4f01\u4e1a\u7248\u8bd5\u7528\r\n- [\u7533\u8bf7\u4f01\u4e1a\u7248\u8bd5\u7528](https://jinshuju.net/f/kyOYpi)\r\n> \u6ce8\uff1a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7248\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u7533\u8bf7\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u901f\u4e0b\u8f7d\u94fe\u63a5\r\n\r\n## \u7248\u672c\u53d8\u5316  What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Bug\u4fee\u590d Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- perf: \u4fee\u6539 `Logo` \u548c\u6587\u6848\u7684\u663e\u793a", "created_at": "2021-05-24T02:56:16Z", "project": "Jumpserver", "repo": "jumpserver/jumpserver", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.2", "tag_name": "v1.7.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/releases/tag/v1.7.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault", "body": "## 1.7.2\r\n### May 20th, 2021\r\n\r\nSECURITY:\r\n\r\n* Non-Expiring Leases: Vault and Vault Enterprise renewed nearly-expiring token\r\nleases and dynamic secret leases with a zero-second TTL, causing them to be\r\ntreated as non-expiring, and never revoked.

(k3s-io/k3s#3235)\r\n* The install script properly passes through shell metacharacters present in K3s command-line flags. (k3s-io/k3s#3355)\r\n* The install script now ensures correct filesystem permissions for the environment file when run as a non-root user. (k3s-io/k3s#3355 @claycooper)\r\n* The uninstall script now attempts to unmount CSI volumes before cleaning up the local filesystem. (k3s-io/k3s#3265 @angelnu)\r\n* CLI flags loaded from configuration files are now included in the node-args annotation. (k3s-io/k3s#3290)\r\n* When merging multiple configuration files from `config.yaml.d`, lists can be appended to instead of replaced by ending the flag name with `+`. (k3s-io/k3s#3229)\r\n* Etcd snapshots can now be listed, pruned, and deleted via the `k3s etcd-snapshot` subcommand (k3s-io/k3s#3277 k3s-io/k3s#3303 k3s-io/k3s#3310)\r\n* K3s now supports specifying an alternative registry to host images for packaged components, via the `--system-default-registry` CLI flag. (k3s-io/k3s#3285)  \r\n    This setting is configured on servers, propagated to agents. Any images found in airgap tarballs will be retagged to appear to come from this registry as well as the default registry (docker.io).\r\n* The in-cluster Kubernetes apiserver certificate is now valid for the same hostnames/addresses as the external certificate. (k3s-io/k3s#3241)\r\n* The Kubernetes default certificate signing controllers now use the correct CAs to sign server certificates. (k3s-io/k3s#3259 @siegfriedweber)\r\n* Conntrack-related sysctls critical to the operation of kube-proxy are now set directly by K3s, instead of by the embedded kube-proxy. (k3s-io/k3s#3341)\r\n* Privileged containers can now be run inside Dockerized K3s clusters (`k3d`, `docker run rancher/k3s`, etc) without receiving a \"apply caps: operation not permitted: unknown\" error. (k3s-io/k3s#3359)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known Issues: \r\n* There is a [regression](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2669) that may cause issues with deleting nodes due to finalizers not being removed. If you observe a node is stuck for some time and is not being deleted you can describe the node to see if any finalizers remain. If there are any finalizers, you can work around this issue by running the following command to remove the finalizers:\r\n```bash\r\n# replace $NODENAME with the name of the node\r\nkubectl patch node $NODENAME -p '{\"metadata\":{\"finalizers\":[]}}' --type=merge\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.21.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md#v1211) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.6.0](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.6.0) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.33.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_33_0.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.4.13-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.4.13-k3s1) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.4.4-k3s2](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.4-k3s2) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.0.0-rc95](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.13.1-rc2 (273b36c)](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/compare/v0.13.1-rc2...273b36c) | \r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.3.6](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.6) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.4.8](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.8) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.8.3](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.8.3) | \r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.9.1](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.9.1) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.19](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.19) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage. There has been some significant progress made on the alpha features as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Enhanced [ZFS Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) to use a custom node label called `openebs.io/nodeid` to set the node affinity for the provisioned volume. By default, the value will be the same as `kubernetes.io/hostname`.  Using a custom label like this will help in quickly migrating the volumes to a new node in cases where a node fails and the user needs to move the underlying disks to a new node in the cluster. After moving the disks, the user can set the `openebs.io/nodeid` with the value used in the previous node. (https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/issues/304). You can read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/blob/master/docs/faq.md#8-how-to-migrate-pvs-to-the-new-node-in-case-old-node-is-not-accessible).\r\n- Enhanced [cStor Velero plugin](https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/pull/154) to allow users to specify a custom timeout for completing snapshot operations. The timeout can be configured via the `restApiTimeout ` field in VolumeSnapshotLocation. See [example](https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/blob/master/example/06-volumesnapshotlocation.yaml). (https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/issues/148)\r\n- Added helm chart for [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/tree/master/deploy/helm/charts). \r\n- Enhanced [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/blob/master/docs/storageclasses.md) to allow users to specify a pattern string of volume groups from which LVM Local PV should be provisioned. This feature will help in cases where a node can have multiple volume groups or volume group names across the cluster have to be unique. (https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/28)\r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- [cStor] Fixed an issue where helm chart pre-delete webhook was using a deprecated `hyperkube` image. Moved to `kubectl` images from [bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kubectl). (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3383)\r\n- [cStor] Fixed an issue where some of the cStor operators were using deprecated `ubuntu 16.04` as the base image. Moved to `ubuntu 18.04`.(https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3386)\r\n- Several fixes to docs were also included in this release. \r\n- OpenEBS participated in the CNCF BugBash program in KubeCon EU 2021 and has received more than [90 PRs, out of which 50+](https://github.com/search?o=asc&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Aevent%2Fkubecon-eu21-bugbash+org%3Aopenebs&s=created&state=closed&type=Issues) were accepted. \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v2.9.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugmayastor.html) 0.8.0 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 2.9.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 2.9.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.7.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.4.4 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.2.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Jiva](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/jiva.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-hostpath.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-device.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [cStor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/cstor.html) 2.9.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.3.0 (alpha)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.4.1 (beta)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alpha Feature Updates\r\n- [Dynamic NFS Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner)\r\n   - Multi-arch container images with support for amd64, arm64, arm, and ppc64le\r\n   - Helm chart \r\n- [CSI Driver for Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv)\r\n   - Support Creation and Deletion of a Local PV - by creating a partition of the requested capacity on local block devices. \r\n- [openebsctl](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl)\r\n   - Refactor the CLI to support `APP VERB NOUN` format.

Files stored by Alertmanager previously are migrated to new hierarchy. Support for this migration will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3910\r\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: deprecated `-ruler.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) in favour of `-ruler-storage.*`. The deprecated config will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3945\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: deprecated `-alertmanager.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) in favour of `-alertmanager-storage.*`. This change doesn't apply to `-alertmanager.storage.path` and `-alertmanager.storage.retention`. The deprecated config will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #4002\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-cluster.` CLI flags deprecated in Cortex 1.7. The new config options to use are: #3946\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.listen-address` instead of `-cluster.listen-address`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.advertise-address` instead of `-cluster.advertise-address`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.peers` instead of `-cluster.peer`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout` instead of `-cluster.peer-timeout`\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: removed the config option `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-cache.postings-compression-enabled`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6. Postings compression is always enabled. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier: removed the config option `-store.max-look-back-period`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6 and was used only by the chunks storage. You should use `-querier.max-query-lookback` instead. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Query Frontend: removed the config option `-querier.compress-http-responses`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6. You should use`-api.response-compression-enabled` instead. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Runtime-config / overrides: removed the config options `-limits.per-user-override-config` (use `-runtime-config.file`) and `-limits.per-user-override-period` (use `-runtime-config.reload-period`), both deprecated since Cortex 0.6.0. #4112\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex now fails fast on startup if unable to connect to the ring backend. #4068\r\n* [FEATURE] The following features have been marked as stable: #4101\r\n  - Shuffle-sharding\r\n  - Querier support for querying chunks and blocks store at the same time\r\n  - Tracking of active series and exporting them as metrics (`-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` and related flags)\r\n  - Blocks storage: lazy mmap of block indexes in the store-gateway (`-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-lazy-loading-enabled`)\r\n  - Ingester: close idle TSDB and remove them from local disk (`-blocks-storage.tsdb.close-idle-tsdb-timeout`)\r\n* [FEATURE] Memberlist: add TLS configuration options for the memberlist transport layer used by the gossip KV store. #4046\r\n  * New flags added for memberlist communication:\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-enabled`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-cert-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-key-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-ca-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-server-name`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-insecure-skip-verify`\r\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: added `local` backend support to the ruler storage configuration under the `-ruler-storage.` flag prefix. #3932\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgraded Docker base images to `alpine:3.13`. #4042\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: reduce ingester memory by eliminating series reference cache. #3951\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: optimized `<prefix>/api/v1/rules` and `<prefix>/api/v1/alerts` when ruler sharding is enabled. #3916\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added the following metrics when ruler sharding is enabled: #3916\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_clients`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_client_request_duration_seconds`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add API endpoint to list all tenant alertmanager configs: `GET /multitenant_alertmanager/configs`. #3529\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add API endpoint to list all tenant ruler rule groups: `GET /ruler/rule_groups`. #3529\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend/scheduler: added querier forget delay (`-query-frontend.querier-forget-delay` and `-query-scheduler.querier-forget-delay`) to mitigate the blast radius in the event queriers crash because of a repeatedly sent \"query of death\" when shuffle-sharding is enabled. #3901\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: reduced memory allocations when serializing query response. #3964\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / ruler: some optimizations to PromQL query engine. #3934 #3989\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory when an high number of errors are returned by the ingester on the write path with the blocks storage. #3969 #3971 #3973\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: reduce CPU and memory when an high number of errors are returned by the distributor on the write path. #3990\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Put metric before label value in the \"label value too long\" error message. #4018\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow use of `y|w|d` suffixes for duration related limits and per-tenant limits. #4044\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Small optimization on top of PR #3968 to avoid unnecessary Extents merging. #4026\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a metric `cortex_compactor_compaction_interval_seconds` for the compaction interval config value. #4040\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added following per-ingester (instance) experimental limits: max number of series in memory (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-series`), max number of users in memory (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-tenants`), max ingestion rate (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-ingestion-rate`), and max inflight requests (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`). These limits are only used when using blocks storage. Limits can also be configured using runtime-config feature, and current values are exported as `cortex_ingester_instance_limits` metric. #3992.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Cortex is now built with Go 1.16. #4062\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added per-distributor experimental limits: max number of inflight requests (`-distributor.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`) and max ingestion rate in samples/sec (`-distributor.instance-limits.max-ingestion-rate`). If not set, these two are unlimited. Also added metrics to expose current values (`cortex_distributor_inflight_push_requests`, `cortex_distributor_ingestion_rate_samples_per_second`) as well as limits (`cortex_distributor_instance_limits` with various `limit` label values). #4071\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Added `-ruler.enabled-tenants` and `-ruler.disabled-tenants` to explicitly enable or disable rules processing for specific tenants. #4074\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Block Storage Ingester: `/flush` now accepts two new parameters: `tenant` to specify tenant to flush and `wait=true` to make call synchronous. Multiple tenants can be specified by repeating `tenant` parameter. If no `tenant` is specified, all tenants are flushed, as before. #4073\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: validate configured `-alertmanager.web.external-url` and fail if ends with `/`. #4081\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: added `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` and `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` to block specific network addresses in HTTP-based Alertmanager receiver integrations. #4085\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow configuration of Cassandra's host selection policy. #4069\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: retry synching blocks if a per-tenant sync fails. #3975 #4088\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add metric `cortex_tcp_connections` exposing the current number of accepted TCP connections. #4099\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Allow federated queries to run concurrently. #4065\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Label Values API call now supports `match[]` parameter when querying blocks on storage (assuming `-querier.query-store-for-labels-enabled` is enabled). #4133\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler-API: fix bug where `/api/v1/rules/<namespace>/<group_name>` endpoint return `400` instead of `404`. #4013\r\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: reverted changes done to rate limiting in #3825. #3948\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix race condition when opening and closing tsdb concurrently. #3959\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: streamline tracing spans. #3924\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler Storage: ignore objects with empty namespace or group in the name. #3999\r\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: fix issue causing distributors to not extend the replication set because of failing instances when zone-aware replication is enabled. #3977\r\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Fix issue where cached entry size keeps increasing when making tiny query repeatedly. #3968\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: `-compactor.blocks-retention-period` now supports weeks (`w`) and years (`y`). #4027\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: returning 422 (instead of 500) when query hits `max_chunks_per_query` limit with block storage, when the limit is hit in the store-gateway. #3937\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Rule group limit enforcement should now allow the same number of rules in a group as the limit. #3616\r\n* [BUGFIX] Frontend, Query-scheduler: allow querier to notify about shutdown without providing any authentication. #4066\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed race condition causing queries to fail right after querier startup with the \"empty ring\" error. #4068\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: Increment `cortex_compactor_runs_failed_total` if compactor failed compact a single tenant. #4094\r\n* [BUGFIX] Tracing: hot fix to avoid the Jaeger tracing client to indefinitely block the Cortex process shutdown in case the HTTP connection to the tracing backend is blocked. #4134\r\n* [BUGFIX] Forward proper EndsAt from ruler to Alertmanager inline with Prometheus behaviour. #4017\r\n\r\n## Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Builder: add `-builder.timestamp-tolerance` option which may reduce block size by rounding timestamps to make difference whole seconds. #3891\r\n", "created_at": "2021-05-14T14:27:54Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.5-dev0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/1f97306ecc0cf1e0b7c324406f45b256286e9766", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.5-dev0\n\nReleased version 2.5-dev0 with the following main changes :\n    - MINOR: version: it's development again", "created_at": "2021-05-14T07:36:37Z", "project": "HaProxy", "repo": "haProxy/haProxy", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.1.6", "tag_name": "1.1.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/1.1.6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kuma", "body": "\ud83d\udc49 [Read the full announcement on the Kuma blog](https://kuma.io/blog/2021/kuma-1-1-6/)\r\n\r\nWe are happy to announce a new release of Kuma - v1.1.6 -- that ships with new features and bug fixes. We highly suggest to upgrade to this new version.\r\n\r\nImprovements in 1.1.6:\r\n\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 You can now specify any and all tags in a `TrafficPermission` policy.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 You can now specify TCP and HTTP health checks at the same time in the same policy. The health check policy also now includes a `reuse_connection` option.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 The `--gateway` flag is now available in the CLI.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 We have added support for ingress controller installation from `kumactl`. The first ingress controller supported is Kong Gateway.\r\n- You can now install the Kuma demo application with the CLI.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

To get started check the [docs](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/azure/)\r\n\r\n* Default settings for AWS instances are updated to take advantage of recent performance and security features:\r\n    * Default etcd volumes encryption changes to enabled for newly created clusters\r\n    * Default root volume encryption changes to enabled\r\n    * Default etcd volumes type changes from `gp2` to `gp3`\r\n    * Default root volume type changes from `gp2` to `gp3`\r\n\r\n* Added [template funtions](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/cluster_template/#template-functions) for kubernetes version based on channel data.\r\n\r\n* kOps now use helm3 functions for merging template `--set` and `--values` arguments. This has slightly different behaviour than previous helm2-like logic.\r\n\r\n* Following kubeadm, control plane nodes are now labelled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=\"\"`\r\n\r\n* Default node image for GCE changed from COS to Ubuntu for K8s versions >= 1.18.0. This is to more closely align with the AWS implementation (the most mature support) and because COS limits the ability to modify files on its disk.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes 1.11 and 1.12 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been removed.  All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* If you are using the Calico network plugin in a cross-subnet setup, you may have to manually remove the AWS Source/Dest Check controller (`k8s-ec2-srcdst`) deployment that was previously deprecated and replaced with the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) feature.\r\n\r\n* If you are using self-hosted channels files, you have to add the new `architectureID` field, with one of the `amd64` or `arm64` values.\r\n\r\n* If you are running `kops toolbox template` in an airgapped environment, you have to set `--channel` to point to a local channel file.\r\n\r\n* If your workload targets control plane nodes, you need to change them to select the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=\"\"` label. You should also add the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` toleration to these workloads. This taint will not be added to control plane nodes before kOps 1.22.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.13 and 1.14 are deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.21.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and will be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.22\r\n\r\n* The experimental node-authorizer that could be enabled using `nodeAuthorization` has been removed. Setting this value is now forbidden.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated.

When the WHERE clause is determined to be always false,\ne.g. due to the actual parameter values, the result of some aggregate\nfunctions may be picked up from the previous execution.\n\nThe reason for this is that the aggregator object for such functions\nis not set up, instead the no_rows_in_result() function should be\ncalled and set the null_value flag (at least when the aggregate function\nis nullable). After inspection, it was observed that the SUM and the\nGROUP_CONCAT functions missed the necessary no_rows_in_result()\nimplementations. These have now been implemented to call the clear()\nfunction, which will set the null_value for the function result.\n\nIt was also detected that the NTILE function was always made nullable,\neven though it can never return NULL unless the argument is NULL.\nThis problem was also fixed.\n\nReviewed by: Chaithra Gopala Reddy <chaithra.gopalareddy@oracle.com>\n\nChange-Id: Ied8ab405a3afa520a23dd95d106f4ba7312a6f02", "created_at": "2021-04-23T15:00:38Z", "project": "Mysql", "repo": "mysql/mysql-server", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Longhorn v1.1.1 Release", "tag_name": "v1.1.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.1.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "**v1.1.1 released!** \ud83c\udf86\r\n\r\nThere are many new features, enhancements, and bug fixes including different areas as below. Especially, most of the major items are driven by community users to enhance and improve Longhorn functionalities and stability. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- Automatic Longhorn Engine Upgrade\r\n  - Before v1.1.1, for live engine image upgrade, users only can manually upgrade the engine image of each healthy volume. v1.1.1 supports this to avoid needless user intervention [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/auto-uprade-engine/)]\r\n- Virtual Machine Volume Support\r\n  - Virtual machine volume creation by Longhorn backing image [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/advanced-resources/backing-image/)]\r\n  - Backing image management native support without any 3rd-party image repository [[LEP](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20210305-backing-image.md)]\r\n  - Virtual machine live migration support by Longhorn migratable RWO volume [[LEP](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20210216-volume-live-migration.md)]\r\n  - Ability to use as a volume storage service by virtualization orchestration solutions like [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io/)\r\n- Granular Resource Reservation for Longhorn Engine/Replica\r\n  - Before v1.1.1, users only can configure a global setting for CPU resource reservation for each engine/replica. v1.1.1 supports granular node-specific settings for each engine/replica individually. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/best-practices/#guaranteed-instance-manager-cpu)]\r\n- AWS IAM Role Support to Generate Temporary AWS credentials\r\n  - Besides using IAM user credentials, v1.1.1 allows users to configure IAM Assume Role to generate temporary credentials by AWS security token service to do the backup and restore operations. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target/#set-up-aws-s3-backupstore)]\r\n- Longhorn Frontend WebSocket Performance Enhancement to Improve User Experience\r\n  - Improves the UI performance to adopt event-driven data update to reduce needless network traffic caused by frequently pulling the updated info from the backend.\r\n- Dependency Installation Manifests for Node Prerequisites\r\n  - Comes out with some installation manifests for prerequisites (like iSCSI and NFS client libraries). It's not integrated into the Longhorn installation process, but it's optional and helpful for users to prepare the environment ready for Longhorn.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher catalog, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n### Automatic Longhorn Engine Upgrade supported\r\n\r\nBesides manually upgrading Longhorn engines, it's able to do automatic engine upgrades with configurable settings and conditions.\r\n\r\n**Concurrent Automatic Engine Upgrade Per Node Limit Setting**\r\n\r\n- Controls the maximum number of engines per node that are allowed to automatically upgrade to the default engine image at the same time. The default value is 0, so Longhorn will not automatically upgrade volumes\u2019 engines to the default version by default. If configured, we recommend setting the value to 3 to leave some room for error but don\u2019t overwhelm the system with too many failed upgrades. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#concurrent-automatic-engine-upgrade-per-node-limit)]\r\n  \r\n**Conditions of Automatic Engine Upgrade**\r\n\r\nIf the value of `Concurrent Automatic Engine Upgrade Per Node Limit Setting` is bigger than 0, in the below conditions, the automatic engine upgrade will happen.\r\n\r\n- Healthy attached volumes - Live upgrade\r\n- Detached volumes - Offline upgrade\r\n\r\nBut, Longhorn doesn\u2019t automatically upgrade disaster recovery volumes to the new default engine image because it would trigger a full restoration for the disaster recovery volumes. The full restoration might affect the performance of other running Longhorn volumes in the system, so we leave it to users to decide to do manual engine upgrades at the appropriate time. For the detailed, check [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/auto-uprade-engine/)]\r\n\r\n### Engine Manager CPU Request and Replica Manager CPU Request introduced, but Guaranteed Engine CPU deprecated\r\n\r\nThe new node-specific `Engine Manager CPU Request` and `Replica Manager CPU Request` reservations are introduced, and the existing `Guaranteed Engine CPU` gets deprecated. To avoid crashing existing volumes after Longhorn Manager upgrade, the deprecated setting `Guaranteed Engine CPU` will be automatically set `Engine Manager CPU Request` and `Replica Manager CPU Request` from each node based on the deprecated setting value during the upgrade. Then, the new global instance manager CPU settings Guaranteed Engine Manager CPU and Guaranteed Replica Manager CPU won\u2019t take effect. \r\n\r\nFor the detailed, check [[doc: post-upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/longhorn-manager/#post-upgrade)], [[doc: guaranteed-engine-manager-cpu](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#guaranteed-engine-manager-cpu)], and [[doc: guaranteed-replica-manager-cpu](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#guaranteed-replica-manager-cpu)]\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n  \r\n  -

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
