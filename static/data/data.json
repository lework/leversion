A key highlight is Mayastor's new support for RDMA as a transport protocol for volume targets over NVMe over Fabrics (NVMeoF). In addition, the release includes various usability and functional fixes for both the LocalPV ZFS and LocalPV Hostpath provisioners, along with documentation enhancements to help users and new contributors get started quickly.\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n### Local Storage\r\n- **ZFS Enhancements:**\r\n  - Support for the `zstd-fast` compression algorithm in LocalPV ZFS.\r\n  - Flexibility to choose between `refquota` or `quota` for ZFS volumes.\r\n  - Fixes in volume provisioning, controller behavior, reservation, and deployment.\r\n- **LocalPV Hostpath Improvements:**\r\n  - Eviction tolerations added to the Hostpath provisioner deployment.\r\n  - Helper pod now allowed to use the host network.\r\n  - Added a global `imageRegistry` Helm parameter for specifying an image registry for all images.\r\n\r\n### LocalPV Release Notes\r\n\r\n- **LocalPV-ZFS:**  \r\n  Refer to the [LocalPV-ZFS v2.7.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/releases/tag/v2.7.0) for detailed changes.\r\n- **LocalPV Hostpath:**  \r\n  Refer to the [LocalPV Hostpath v4.2.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner/releases/tag/v4.2.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues for LocalPV\r\n- **Controller Pod Restart on Single Node Setups:**  \r\n  After upgrading, single node setups may face issues where the ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv controller pod does not enter the Running state due to changes in the controller manifest (now a Deployment) and missing affinity rules.\r\n  - **Workaround:** Delete the old controller pod to allow the new pod to be scheduled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Replicated Storage (Mayastor)\r\n- **NVMe-oF RDMA Support:**\r\n  - Mayastor volume targets can now be shared over RDMA transport, providing high throughput and reduced latency.\r\n  - Enabled via a Helm chart option that works in conjunction with specifying an RDMA-capable network interface.\r\n- **CSAL ftl bdev Support:**\r\n  - Integration of the SPDK ftl bdev (Cloud Storage Acceleration Layer) to support layered devices with a fast cache for buffering writes.\r\n- **Additional Enhancements:**\r\n  - Detection of the builtin `nvme-tcp` module on Talos-like platforms.\r\n  - Stability fixes in volume target failover and application move scenarios.\r\n  - Eviction tolerations added to the DSP operator deployment and CSI-controller for faster failover.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n- **Kubernetes Requirement:** Kubernetes 1.23 or higher is recommended.\r\n- **Engine Compatibility:** Upgrades to OpenEBS 4.2.0 are supported only for the following engines:\r\n  - Local PV Hostpath\r\n  - Local PV LVM\r\n  - Local PV ZFS\r\n  - Mayastor (from earlier editions, 3.10.x or below)\r\n\r\n## Replicated PV Mayastor Release Notes\r\n\r\n- **Mayastor**  \r\n  Refer to the [Mayastor v2.8.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor/releases/tag/v2.7.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## Known Behavioural Limitations\r\n- The Mayastor IO engine fully utilizes allocated CPU cores regardless of I/O load, running a poller at full speed.\r\n- A Mayastor DiskPool is limited to a single block device and cannot span multiple block devices.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n### Replicated PV (Mayastor)\r\n- **DiskPool Capacity Expansion:**  \r\n  Mayastor does not support the capacity expansion of DiskPools as of v2.8.0.\r\n- **IO-Engine Pod Restarts:**  \r\n  Under heavy I/O and during constant scaling up/down of volume replicas, the io-engine pod may restart occasionally.\r\n- **fsfreeze Operation Failure:**  \r\n  If a pod-based workload is scheduled on a node that reboots and the pod lacks a controller (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), the volume unpublish operation might not be triggered. This leads the control plane to assume the volume is still published, causing the fsfreeze operation to fail during snapshot creation.\r\n  - **Workaround:** Recreate or reinstate the pod to ensure proper volume mounting.\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-02-17T10:09:16Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "3.5.0", "tag_name": "3.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/releases/tag/3.5.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\nZipkin now supports [Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) as a span transport, enabled by `PULSAR_SERVICE_URL` and documented [here](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server#pulsar-collector).

This support is very early and not fully complete, and the command line interface for these tools has not been finalized. We welcome feedback on the new artifact experience through our issue tracker!\r\n- The `podman update` command now supports a wide variety of options related to healthchecks (including `--health-cmd` to define a new healthcheck and `--no-healthcheck` to disable an existing healthcheck), allowing healthchecks to be added to, removed from, and otherwise updated on existing containers. You can find full details on the 15 added options in the manpage.\r\n- The `--mount type=volume` option for the `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman volume create` commands now supports a new option, `subpath=`, to make only a subset of the volume visible in the container ([#20661](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20661)).\r\n- The `--userns=keep-id` option for the `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now supports a new option, `--userns=keep-id:size=`, to configure the size of the user namespace ([#24387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24837)).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports Container Device Interface (CDI) devices ([#17833](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17833)).\r\n- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--playbook`, to run an Ansible playbook in the created VM on first boot for initial configuration.\r\n- Quadlet `.pod` files now support a new field, `ShmSize`, to specify the size of the pod's shared SHM ([#22915](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22915)).\r\n- The `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now support a new option, `--hosts-file`, to define the base file used for `/etc/hosts` in the container.\r\n- The `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` commands now support a new option, `--no-hostname`, which disables the creation of `/etc/hostname` in the container ([#25002](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25002)).\r\n- The `podman network create` command now supports a new option for `bridge` networks, `--opt mode=unmanaged`, which allows Podman to use an existing network bridge on the system without changes.\r\n- The `--network` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` now accepts a new option for `bridge` networks, `host_interface_name`, which specifies a name for the network interface created outside the container.\r\n- The `podman manifest rm` command now supports a new option, `--ignore`, to not error when removing manifests that do not exist.\r\n- The `podman system prune` command now supports a new option, `--build`, to remove build containers leftover from prematurely terminated builds.\r\n- The `podman events` command now generates events for the creation and removal of networks ([#24032](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24032)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n- Due to a lack of availability of hardware to test on, the Podman maintainers are no longer capable of providing full support for Podman on Intel Macs. Binaries and machine images will still be produced, and pull requests related to MacOS on Intel systems will still be merged, but bugs will be fixed on a best effort basis only. We welcome any potential new maintainers who would be able to assist in restoring full support.\r\n- Quadlet previously incorrectly allowed `:` as a character to define comments. This was a mistake; developer intent and documentation was that `#` and `;` were to be used as comment characters instead, matching systemd. This has been corrected, and semicolons now define comments instead of colons.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Podman now passes container hostnames to Netavark, which will use them for any DHCP requests for the container.\r\n- Partial pulls of `zstd:chunked` images now only happen for images that have a `RootFS.DiffID` entry in the image's OCI config JSON, and require the layer contents to match. This resolves issues with image ID ambiguity when partial pulls were enabled.\r\n- Packagers can now set the `BUILD_ORIGIN` environment variable when building podman from the `Makefile`. This provides information on who built the Podman binary, and is displayed in `podman version` and  `podman info`. This will help upstream bug reports, allowing maintainers to trace how and where the binary was built and installed from.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine` VMs on WSL could fail to start when using usermode networking could fail to start due to a port conflict ([#20327](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20327)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where overlay mounts could not be made at paths where the image specifies a volume ([#24555](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24555)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command did not honor the `no_pivot_root` setting from `containers.conf` ([#24546](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24546)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where volumes would have the wrong permissions if `podman cp` was used to copy into a fresh volume in a container that had never been started.\r\n- Fixed a bug where using `podman cp` to copy into a named volume requiring a mount (image volumes, volumes backed by a volume plugin, or other volumes with options) would fail when the container being copied into was stopped.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rlimits would be set incorrectly when Podman was run as root but without `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` ([#24692](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24692)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats --all` command would fail if a container started with `--cgroups=none` was present ([#24632](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24632)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command would only return details on one image store even if additional image stores were configured in `storage.conf`.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman update` command could reset resource limits that were not being modified to default ([#24610](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24610)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman update` command could not update resource limits on devices mounted into the container ([#24734](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24734)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest annotate` command could panic when the `--index` option was used ([#24750](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24750)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a Quadlet container reusing another container's network could cause errors if the second container was not already running.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet files containing lines with a trailing backslash could cause an infinite loop during parsing ([#24810](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24810)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet would, when run as a non-root user, not generate for files in subfolders of `/etc/containers/systemd/users/` ([#24783](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24783)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where values in Quadlet files containing octal escape sequences were incorrectly unescaped.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman generate kube` could generate persistent volumes with mixed-case names or names containing an underscore, which are not supported by Kubernetes ([#16542](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16542)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `ptmxmode` option to `--mount type=devpts` did not function.\r\n- Fixed a bug where shell completion on Windows would include `.exe` in the executable name, breaking completion on some shells.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the output of `podman inspect` on containers did not include the ID of the network the container was joined to, improving Docker compatibility ([#24910](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24910)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with the remote API incorrectly included a create command ([#25026](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25026)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where it was possible to specify the `libkrun` backend for VMs on Intel Macs (`libkrun` only supports Arm systems).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `libkrun` and `applehv` VMs from `podman machine` could be started at the same time on Macs ([#25112](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/25112)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman exec` commands could not detach from the exec session using the detach keys ([#24895](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24895)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start due to a database configuration mismatch when certain fields were configured to the empty string ([#24738](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24738)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Compat and Libpod Build APIs for Images now support a new query parameter, `nohosts`, which (when set to true) does not create `/etc/hosts` in the image when building.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create API for Containers did not honor CDI devices, preventing (among other things) the use of GPUs with `docker compose` ([#19338](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19338)).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The Docker alias script has been fixed to better handle variable substitution.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman-restart.service` functioned incorrectly when no containers were present.\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.39.0\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.62.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.57.1\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.34.0", "created_at": "2025-02-11T16:08:16Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type":

[#13157](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13157)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * [`rabbitmqadmin` v2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management-cli) has matured enough to recommend\r\n   it over the original version of the tool\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmq-diagnostics ` CLI documentation was improved to clarify that all certificates\r\n   discovered will be checked for expiration.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13038](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13038)\r\n\r\n * New health checks for [metadata store](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) initialization:\r\n\r\n   1. `rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_metadata_store_is_initialized`\r\n   2. `rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_metadata_store_is_initialized_with_data`\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13169](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13169)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Improved metric description.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13178](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13178)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Pagination-related sections of the HTTP API reference were clarified to explain\r\n   that the maximum page size cannot exceed 500.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13042](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13042)\r\n\r\n * Empty `channel_details` objects are now serialized as empty objects and not empty arrays.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13091](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13091)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * New health checks for [metadata store](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/metadata-store) initialization:\r\n\r\n   1. GET `/api/health/checks/metadata-store/initialized`\r\n   2. GET `/api/health/checks/metadata-store/initialized/with-data`\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13169](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13169)\r\n\r\n#### Deprecations\r\n\r\n * The original HTTP API One True Health Check\u2122 is now a no-op. A comparable \"mega health check\"\r\n   has long been deprecated in CLI tools and was made a no-op in `4.0.0`.\r\n\r\n   This endpoint was using a [deprecated feature](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/deprecated-features): a classic non-exclusive transient (non-durable) queue.\r\n\r\n   See [Health Checks](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#health-checks) for modern focused alternatives.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13047](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13047)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `cluster_formation.registration.enabled` is a new configuration setting that allows the backend to skip registration.\r\n\r\n   This is useful when Consul is used for peer discovery but a different tool such as Nomad\r\n   is used to keep track of the services and their registration, unregistration.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @frederikbosch.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13201](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13201)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Erlang AMQP 1.0 Client\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Purging an non-existing queue now returns a 404 response.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#13148](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/13148)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\n * `ra` was upgraded to [`2.15.1`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)\r\n * `observer_cli` was upgraded to [`1.8.2`](https://github.com/zhongwencool/observer_cli/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-4.0.6.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.", "created_at": "2025-02-11T04:45:07Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Istio 1.24.3", "tag_name": "1.24.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.24.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/istio/istio", "body": "[Artifacts](http://gcsweb.istio.io/gcs/istio-release/releases/1.24.3/)\r\n[Release Notes](https://istio.io/news/releases/1.24.x/announcing-1.24.3/)", "created_at": "2025-02-11T01:50:35Z", "project": "Istio", "repo": "istio/istio", "type": "ServiceMesh", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.6.4", "tag_name": "v3.6.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/tag/v3.6.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo", "body": "# Quick Start\n\n## What's New?\n\nFind out on [our blog](https://blog.argoproj.io) and [changelog](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Breaking Changes and Known Issues\n\nCheck the [upgrading guide](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading/) and search for [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues).\n\n## Installation\n\n### CLI\n\n#### Mac / Linux\n\nAvailable via `curl`\n\n```bash\n# Detect OS\nARGO_OS=\"darwin\"\nif [[ uname -s != \"Darwin\" ]]; then\n  ARGO_OS=\"linux\"\nfi\n\n# Download the binary\ncurl -sLO \"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.6.4/argo-$ARGO_OS-amd64.gz\"\n\n# Unzip\ngunzip \"argo-$ARGO_OS-amd64.gz\"\n\n# Make binary executable\nchmod +x \"argo-$ARGO_OS-amd64\"\n\n# Move binary to path\nmv \"./argo-$ARGO_OS-amd64\" /usr/local/bin/argo\n\n# Test installation\nargo version\n```\n\n### Controller and Server\n\n```bash\nkubectl create namespace argo\nkubectl apply -n argo -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.6.4/install.yaml\n```\n", "created_at": "2025-02-10T11:15:29Z", "project": "Argo", "repo": "argoproj/argo", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3.2-dev5", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/37e84676c7cb6100d57fcdaef069e8329e67db4d", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 3.2-dev5\n\nReleased version 3.2-dev5 with the following main changes :\n    -

This metric records time spent on search operations in the index. It was introduced in [v1.56.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.56.0). However, this metric was used neither in dashboards nor in alerting rules. It also has high cardinality because index search operations latency can differ by 3 orders of magnitude. Hence, dropping it as unused.**\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmstorage](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve startup times when opening a storage with the [retention](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#retention) exceeding a few months.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the ability to switch the heatmap to a line chart. Now, vmui would suggest to switch to line graph display if heatmap can't be properly rendered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/8057).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): add `-httpInternalListenAddr` cmd-line flag to serve internal HTTP routes `/metrics`, `/flags`, etc. It allows properly route requests to backends with the same service routes as vmauth. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6468) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7345) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: expose `/-/healthy` and `/-/ready` endpoints as Prometheus does on vmselect endpoints, thus achieving full Prometheus compatibility for external dependencies.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly perform graceful shutdown for kafka client.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly add message metadata headers for kafka remoteWrite target.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve clipboard error handling in tables and code snippets by showing detailed messages with possible reasons. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7778).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui) for [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) components: properly display enterprise features when the enterprise version is used.\r\n* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): fix discrepancies when using `or` binary operator. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7759) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7640) issues for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly update number of unique series for [cardinality limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-limiter) on ingestion.

See [Configuration queries (administrator privileges)](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_17-configuration-queries-administrator-privileges).\r\n\r\n### Observer Mode for Application AccessKey \r\nBefore officially enabling application keys, you can configure Application AccessKeys in observation mode to only log without intercepting configuration retrieval.\r\n\r\n### Limitation on the Number of Namespaces and Configuration Items\r\nUsers can now limit the number of namespaces and also the number of configuration items in a single namespace. See [Parameter settings for limiting the number of namespaces in the appld+cluster dimension](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_64-parameter-settings-for-limiting-the-number-of-namespaces-in-the-appldcluster-dimension) and [Limitation on the number of configuration items in a single namespace](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_65-limitation-on-the-number-of-configuration-items-in-a-single-namespace).\r\n\r\n### Cluster-Level Permission Control Support\r\nUsers can now configure editing and publishing permissions for namespaces based on cluster granularity.

([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5338)).\n* Adds support for dual-stack networking for AWS operations.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/52)) \n  * **Note**: As a consequence of updating AWS SDK dependencies to enable\n    dual-stack support, this Boundary release may consume more memory. From our\n    testing, the increase seems to be around 1.6x, however this\n    may vary depending on your deployment architecture.\n* The worker <-> controller communications have been refactored to improve performance\n  and reliability at large scale. Workers older than v0.19.0 will remain supported\n  until the release of v0.20.0, in accordance with\n  [our worker/controller compatiblity policy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/enterprise/supported-versions#control-plane-and-worker-compatibility).\n* Add concurrency limit on the password hashing of all password auth methods.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/5437)).\n\n  This avoids bursty memory and CPU use during concurrent password auth method\n  authentication attempts. The number of concurrent hashing operations\n  can be set with the new `concurrent_password_hash_workers` configuration\n  value in the controller stanza, or the new\n  `BOUNDARY_CONTROLLER_CONCURRENT_PASSWORD_HASH_WORKERS` environment variable.\n  The default limit is 1.\n* ui: Improve worker filter workflow for targets, vault credential-stores, and storage-buckets. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2614)).\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n* Fix bug in applying BOUNDARY_MAX_RETRIES for boundary cli. Previously\n  setting this environment variable would result in a max retries of 2,\n  regardless of the value set.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5385)).\n* Fix bug in parsing IPv6 addresses. Previously setting a target address or the\n  initial upstream address in the config file would result in a malformed value.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5221)).\n* Fix an issue where, when starting a session, the connection limit always displays 0.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5396)).\n* Fix bug which caused the `children` keyword not to apply the appropriate\n  permissions for a number of resources.\n    ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5418)).\n\n", "created_at": "2025-02-06T20:21:18Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo":

This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...) or by directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Review the Install/Upgrade Notes before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\nRancher v2.10.2 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nFor more information on new features in the general minor release see the [v2.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.0).\r\n\r\n## Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where stale impersonation secrets were building up in the `cattle-impersonation-system` namespace. See [#48313](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48313).\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Rancher chart ingress path is set to \"/\" causing https://<rancher_url>/ to fail with \"response 404 (backend NotFound), service rules for the path non-existent.\" The ingress path can now be configured as needed. See [#48167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48167).\r\n\r\n## RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixd an issue where clusters containing nodes with split etcd and control plane roles would fail to reconcile when upgrading Rancher. See [#48389](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48389).\r\n\r\n## Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where users were able to create or edit clusters even when using an invalid Add-on YAML configuration. See [#12466](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12466).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, EOL for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must replatform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about replatforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.10.2\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.10.1](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.10.1)\r\n- RKE - [v1.7.2](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.7.2)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.31.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.30.8\r\n- v1.29.12\r\n- v1.28.15\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.31.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.30.8\r\n- v1.29.12\r\n- v1.28.15\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI. \r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.27 is no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.10.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later. See [#47591](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47591).\r\n  - The new annotation `field.cattle.io/creator-principal-name` was introduced in addition to the existing `field.cattle.io/creatorId` that allows specifying the creator's principal name when creating a cluster or a project. If this annotation is used, the `userPrincipalName` field of the corresponding `ClusterRoleTemplateBinding` or `ProjectRoleTemplateBinding` will be set to the specified principal. The principal should belong to the creator's user, which is enforced by the webhook. See [#46828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46828).\r\n  - When searching for group principals with a SAML authentication provider (with LDAP turned off), Rancher now returns a principal of correct type (group) with the name matching the search term. When searching principals with a SAML provider (with LDAP turned off) without specifying the desired type (as in Add cluster/project member), Rancher now returns both user and group principals with the name matching the search term. See [#44441](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44441).\r\n  - Rancher now captures the last used time for Tokens and stores it in the `lastUsedAt` field. If the Authorized Cluster Endpoint is enabled and used on a downstream cluster Rancher captures the last used time in the `ClusterAuthToken` object and makes the best effort to sync it back to the corresponding Token in the upstream. See [#45732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45732).\r\n  - Rancher deploys the System Upgrade Controller (SUC) to facilitate Kubernetes upgrades for imported RKE2/K3s clusters. Starting with this version, the mechanism used to deploy this component in downstream clusters has transitioned from legacy V1 apps to fully supported V2 apps, providing a seamless upgrade process for Rancher. For more details, please see this [issue comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42448#issuecomment-2477309567).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - The deprecated subcommand `globaldns` was removed from the Rancher CLI. See [#48127](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48127).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - This release includes a major upgrade to the Dashboard (Cluster Explorer) Vue framework from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Please view our documentation on updating existing UI extensions to be compliant with the Rancher v2.10 UI framework in the [v2.10.0 UI extension changelog](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/next/rancher-2.10-support). If experiencing a page that fails to load please file an issue via the [Dashboard repository](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/new/choose) and choose the \"Bug report\" option for us to further investigate. See [#7653](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7653).\r\n  - The performance of the Clusters lists in the Home page and the Side Menu has greatly improved when there are hundreds of clusters. See [#11995](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11995) and [#11993](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11993).\r\n  - The previous Dashboard Ember UI (Cluster Manager) will no longer be directly accessible. The relative pages that rely on the previous UI will continue to be embedded in the new Vue UI (Cluster Explorer). See [#11371](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11371).\r\n  - Updated the data directory configuration by replacing the checkbox option with 3 user input options below:\r\n    1. `Use default data directory configuration`\r\n    2. `Use a common base directory for data directory configuration (sub-directories will be used for the system-agent, provisioning and distro paths)` - This option displays a text input where users can enter a base directory for all 3 subdirectories which Rancher programmatically appends to the correct subdirectories.\r\n    3. `Use custom data directories` - This option displays 3 text inputs, one for each subdirectory type where users can input each path individually.\r\n\r\n    See [#11560](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11560).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\n    Please note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must replatform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\n    RKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about replatforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Virtualization (Harvester)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - On the Cloud Credential list, you can now easily see if a Harvester Credential is about to expire or has expired and choose to renew it. You will also be notified on the Cluster Management Clusters list when an associated Harvester Cloud Credential is about to expire or has expired. When upgrading, an existing expired Harvester Credential will not contain a warning. You can still renew the token on the resources menu. See [#11332](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11332).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Windows\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Rancher v2.10.0 includes changes to how Windows nodes behave post node reboot, as well as provides two new settings to control how Windows services created by Rancher behave on startup.\r\n\r\n    Two new agent environment variables have been added for Windows nodes, `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_SERVICE_DEPENDENCY` and `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_DELAYED_START`. These changes can be configured in the Rancher UI, and will be respected by all nodes running `rancher-wins` version `v0.4.20` or greater.\r\n\r\n    - `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_SERVICE_DEPENDENCY` defines a service dependency between RKE2 and `rancher-wins`, ensuring RKE2 will not start before `rancher-wins`.\r\n    - `CATTLE_ENABLE_WINS_DELAYED_START` changes the start type of `rancher-wins` to `AUTOMATIC (DELAYED)`, ensuring it starts after other Windows services.\r\n\r\n    Additionally, Windows nodes will now attempt to execute plans multiple times if the initial application fails, up to 5 times. This change, as well as appropriate use of the above two agent environment variables, aims to address plan failures for Windows nodes after a node reboot.\r\n\r\n    See [#42458](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42458).\r\n  - A change was made starting with RKE2 versions `v1.28.15`, `v1.29.10`, `v1.30.6` and `v1.31.2` on Windows which allows the user to configure `*_PROXY` environment variables on the `rke2` service after the node has already been provisioned.\r\n\r\n    Previously any attempt to do so would be a no-op. With this change, If the `*_PROXY` environment variables are set on the cluster _after_ a Windows node is provisioned, they can be automatically removed from the `rke2` service. However, if the variables are set _before_ the node is provisioned, they cannot be removed.\r\n\r\n    More information can be found [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47839). A workaround is to remove the environment variables from the `rancher-wins` service and restart the service or node. At which point `*_PROXY` environment variables will no longer be set on either service.\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    Remove-ItemProperty HKLM:SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\rancher-wins -Name Environment\r\n    Restart-Service rancher-wins\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    See [#47544](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47544).\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11435](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11435).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.1**:\r\n  - The Rancher CLI uses dedicated HTTP clients in login and SSH commands to download certificates and an SSH key respectively. However, the CLI currently does not respect proxy settings and does not set an HTTP timeout. See [#48321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48321).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2**:\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7**:\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery (Fleet)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - Target customization for namespace labels and annotations cannot modify/remove labels when updating. See [#3064](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/3064).\r\n  - In version 0.10, GitRepo resources provided a comprehensive list of all deployed resources across all clusters in their status. However, in version 0.11, this list has been modified to report resources only once until the feature is integrated into the Rancher UI. While this change addresses a UI freeze issue, it may result in potential inaccuracies in the list of resources and resource counts under some conditions.

removed from stream and consumer assignment proposals, API advisories and stream snapshot/restore advisories (#6326, #6338)\r\n- Reduced lock contention between the JetStream lock and Raft group locks (#6335)\r\n- Advisories will only be encoded and sent when there is interest, reducing CPU usage (#6341)\r\n- Consumers with inactivity thresholds will now start less clean-up goroutines, which can reduce load on the goroutine scheduler (#6344)\r\n- Consumer cleanup goroutines will now stop faster when the server shuts down (#6351)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- Subject state

streams and consumers being unexpectedly recreated shortly after a deletion (#6362)\r\n- Clients should no longer timeout on a retried ack with the `AckAll` policy after a server restart (#6392)\r\n- Replicated consumers should no longer get stuck after leader changes due to incorrect accounting (#6387)\r\n- Consumers will now correctly handle the case where messages queued for delivery have been removed, fixing a delivery slowdown (#6387, #6399)\r\n- The API in-flight metric has been fixed so that it does not drift after the queue has been dropped (#6373)\r\n- Handles for temporary files are now closed correctly if compression errors occur (#6390) \u2014 Thanks to @deem0n for the contribution!\r\n- JetStream will now shut down correctly when detecting that the store directory underlying filesystem has become read-only (#6292) \u2014 Thanks to @souravagrawal for the contribution!\r\n\r\nLeafnodes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an interest propagation issue that could occur when the hub has a user with subscribe permissions on a literal subject (#6291)\r\n- Fixed a bug where all queue interest across leafnodes could be dropped over gateways in a supercluster deployment after a leafnode connection drops (#6377)\r\n\r\nTests\r\n\r\n- A number of unit tests have been improved (#6150, #6278, #6297, #6300, #6343, #6329, #6330, #6331, #6331, #6334, #6364)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n

In previous versions of Packer, the\n      data sources were evaluated first, then the local variables were, making\n      it impossible to have a datasource that referenced a local variable as\n      part of its configuration.\n      This change introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to evaluate those\n      resources, instead of the phased approach of old, which makes the order\n      of evaluation not dependent on the type of resource, but instead of the\n      detected dependencies between them.\n      **Note**: While we are confident this should be robust enough for general\n      use, we do recognise that it is possible some users might encounter issues.\n      To give those users a way to continue using the old evaluation method, we\n      introduced a `-use-sequential-evaluation` command-line flag to the build,\n      validate, console and inspect subcommands, to force using the sequential\n      evaluation approach for those entities.\n      [GH-13155](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13155)\n\n* core/hcp: support for uploading SBOMs to HCP Packer.\n      Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) are a standardised way to export the various\n      software packages linked to an artifact. As some users have expressed a\n      need to produce and access those for images they build, we now add the\n      feature to Packer itself.\n      While the generation of the SBOM itself is not done directly by\n      Packer, instead we recommend using known scanners to produce them, we add\n      the capacity to upload this SBOM file to HCP Packer, and link it to a\n      build artifact.\n      [GH-13171](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13171)\n\n* core: support for alternate serialisation formats for plugin communication.\n      Packer relies on plugins to do most of the actual workload related to\n      building and provisioing artifacts, while Packer is mostly an orchestrator\n      for those plugins to perform their work.\n      This separation of concerns implies that both entities have to\n      communicate on multiple occasions during the course of a build.\n      Before v1.12.0 of Packer, and v0.6.0 of the plugin SDK, we used Gob to\n      do most of the serialisation for those steps.\n      This is however a bit of a problem recently, as go-cty, the library we\n      use for dynamic objects lifted from HCL templates, dropped support for\n      this a while back.\n      Therefore now, we introduce an alternative: protobuf/msgpack, which are\n      both usable and maintained by the projects around Packer, so we can begin\n      our transition away from gob with this change.\n      **Note**: as with the introduction of the DAG for locals/datasources, this\n      is a feature that we are reasonably confident you will not encounter bugs\n      with, however we cannot rule-out this possibility, therefore we introduce\n      a new environment variable: `PACKER_FORCE_GOB`, which if set to '1', forces\n      the use of Gob instead of protobuf/msgpack.\n      [GH-13120](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13120)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* hcl2/json: add `aws_secretsmanager_raw` funcion.\n      When using the AWS secretsmanager function with a non-text secret, one could\n      only get a secret once at a time.\n      This could get cumbersome if wanting to get multiple through one request,\n      which led people to encode their JSON/Object secrets as a big base64\n      encoded string that they could get once, and then manipulate through JSON\n      functions.\n      While the workaround works, it is one extra layer of manipulations to do so,\n      therefore a new function to always get the raw textual version of a secret\n      is now added to Packer.\n      [GH-13242](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13242)\n* hcl2: add `alltrue` and `anytrue` functions.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL functions `alltrue` and\n      `anytrue`, which returns whether or not a collection only consists of\n      `true` values, or if any is.\n      [GH-13237](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13237)\n* hcl2: add `strcontains` function.\n      As with Terraform, Packer now supports the HCL function `strcontains`,\n      which returns whether or not a string contains a substring within it.\n      [GH-13217](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13217)\n      [GH-13222](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13222)\n* datasource/http: Support other methods than GET.\n      The HTTP datasource used to always use GET requests for getting data\n      from a remote HTTP server, which was not always enough since some endpoints\n      may only support other methods.

The feature allows users to mount directories from the host node's filesystem into their Knative service containers. It enables access to local storage on the node, facilitating use cases such as accessing node-specific data or utilizing local caches. The feature is behind the flag `kubernetes.podspec-volumes-hostpath`. (#15648, @amarflybot)\r\n- Fixes previously supported probe syntax without a leading slash. (#15681, @skonto)\r\n- Fixes revision timeout defaulting when identical values are present in timeout settings. (#15617, @skonto)\r\n- A revision is now set to ContainerHealthy=True when it has ready replicas (#15503, @SaschaSchwarze0)\r\n- Add default container annotation to Pods created by the reconciler (#15694, @konstfish)\r\n- Allow explicitly setting `containers.securityContext.privileged` to `false` (#15643, @KapilSareen)\r\n- Fixes a problem in configuration reconciliation where labeler creates a different order of the route names listed via the annotation `serving.knative.dev/routes` compared to the configuration reconciler. (#15601, @skonto)\r\n- Kubernetes Deployments created for a Knative Revision are not configured with revisionHistoryLimit=0 which saves a lot of space in your Kubernetes database if you have a lot of Knative Services that are not updated while you regularly update Knative itself and pick up new queue-proxy images.

"v1.8.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.8.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "## Longhorn v1.8.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis latest version of Longhorn introduces several features, enhancements, and bug fixes that are intended to improve system quality and the overall user experience. Highlights include new V2 Data Engine features, multiple backupstores, automatic RWX volume expansion, installation and upgrades via Helm Controller, and V2 Data Engine Support for Talos Linux.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorn team appreciates your contributions and anticipates receiving feedback regarding this release.\r\n\r\nFor more information about release-related terminology, see [Releases](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> An incorrect Longhorn image tag (`v1.8.x-head`) was used in the [deployment manifest](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v1.8.0/deploy/longhorn.yaml) and the [Helm chart](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v1.8.0/chart/values.yaml#L40-L65). The correct tag for Longhorn v1.8.0 images is `v1.8.0`. For more information, see [Issue #10336](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10336). \r\n>\r\n> If you installed or upgraded Longhorn using the deployment manifest or the Helm chart from the [main Longhorn repository](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn), perform the following actions to resolve the issue:\r\n>\r\n> - **New installations**: Replace `v1.8.x-head` with `v1.8.0` in the deployment manifest or the Helm chart before deploying Longhorn.\r\n>\r\n> - **Upgrades**: Replace `v1.8.x-head` with `v1.8.0` in the deployment manifest or Helm chart. Next, upgrade the Longhorn system and update the engine image for volumes that use `v1.8.x-head`.\r\n>\r\n> This issue does not affect installations and upgrades performed using the [Longhorn Helm repository](https://charts.longhorn.io). For more details, refer to the [Install with Helm](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/deploy/install/install-with-helm/) section of the official documentation.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\nThe CSI external-snapshotter was upgraded to v8.2.0. Ensure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before upgrading to Longhorn v1.8.0 or a later version.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- The default block size for block-type disks in earlier Longhorn releases is 4096 bytes. However, 512 bytes is more commonly used and aligns with the V1 Data Engine's configuration. Additionally, the 4096-byte block size is incompatible with backing images generated by the V1 Data Engine. To address these concerns, the default block size was changed to 512 bytes.\r\n\r\n  If you have existing V2 volumes, perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n    1. Back up the V2 volumes.\r\n    2. Remove the V2 volumes.\r\n    3. Delete the block-type disk with a 4096-byte block size from `node.spec.disks`.\r\n    4. Erase the old data on the block-type disk using tools such as dd.\r\n    5. Add the disk again to `node.spec.disks` with the updated configuration.\r\n    6. Restore the V2 volumes.\r\n\r\n    For more information, see [#10053](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10053).\r\n\r\n- A V2 volume data corruption issue that affects earlier Longhorn releases has been resolved in v1.8.0. The issue involves potential continual changes to the checksum of files in a V2 volume with multiple replicas. This occurs because SPDK allocates clusters without initialization, leading to data inconsistencies across replicas. The varying data read from the volume can result in data corruption and broken backups. For more information, see [#10035](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10135).\r\n\r\n## Primary Highlights\r\n\r\n### New V2 Data Engine Features\r\n\r\nAlthough the V2 Data Engine is still considered an experimental feature in this release, the core functions have been significantly enhanced.\r\n\r\n- [Configurable CPU cores](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/v2-data-engine/features/configurable-cpu-cores): Support the global and node-specific configuration options provide greater control and flexibility for optimizing performance and resource allocation.\r\n- [Disaster recovery (DR) volumes](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6613): Designed to store data in a backup cluster in the event of a failure in the main cluster. DR volumes enhance the resiliency of Longhorn volumes by ensuring data can be quickly restored in case of cluster outages.\r\n- [Auto-salvage volumes](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8430): Automatically repair volumes in the event of a failure.\r\n- [Live migration](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6361): Allow for the migration of volumes from one node to another without interrupting the services using those volumes.\r\n- [Volume encryption](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7355): Ensure data stored in volumes is protected through encryption in transit and at rest.\r\n- [Delta replica rebuilding using snapshot checksum](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9488).\r\n- [Backing image update and download](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6341).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Multiple Backupstores and Default Backup Target\r\n\r\nStarting with v1.8.0, Longhorn allows you to use multiple backupstores for storing backups of Longhorn volumes. Longhorn v1.8.0 also creates a default backup target (`default`) during installation and upgrades. The default backup target is used for system backups and volumes that were created without an assigned backup target name.\r\n\r\n[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvsz6YLDLrM) | [Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target/) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5411)\r\n\r\n### Automatic RWX Volume Expansion\r\n\r\nLonghorn v1.8.0 supports fully automatic online expansion of RWX volumes without the need to scale down the workload or apply manual commands. To use this feature, ensure that the v1.8.0 versions of Longhorn Manager, Share Manager, and the CSI plugin are all running.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/nodes-and-volumes/volumes/expansion/#rwx-volume) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9736)\r\n\r\n### Helm Controller\r\n\r\nYou can now install and upgrade Longhorn on clusters running RKE2 or K3s using the Helm Controller that is built into those distributions. The Helm Controller manages Helm charts using a HelmChart Custom Resource Definition (CRD), which contains most of the options that would normally be passed to the Helm command-line tool.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/deploy/install/install-with-helm-controller/) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9506)\r\n\r\n### V2 Data Engine Support for Talos Linux\r\n\r\nLonghorn v1.8.0 supports usage of V2 volumes in Talos Linux clusters. To use this feature, ensure that all nodes meet the V2 Data Engine prerequisites. \r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/advanced-resources/os-distro-specific/talos-linux-support#v2-data-engine) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7791)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before installing Longhorn v1.8.0.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.7.x to v1.8.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.8.0/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Post-Release Known Issues\r\n\r\nFor information about issues identified after this release, see [Release-Known-Issues](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Release-Known-Issues).\r\n\r\n### Highlight\r\n- [FEATURE] Support encrypted v2 volumes [7355](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7355) - @mantissahz @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Support v2 volume delta replica rebuilding based on snapshot checksum: data plane and control plane [9488](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9488) - @shuo-wu @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Multiple backup stores support [5411](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5411) - @mantissahz @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Support v2 volume delta replica rebuilding based on snapshot checksum: SPDK part [5573](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/5573) - @DamiaSan @roger-ryao\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] v2 volume supports data locality [9371](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9371) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] SPDK volume supports live migration [6361](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6361) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Support backing image for v2 volume [6341](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6341) - @yangchiu @ChanYiLin @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Make CPU core configurable for v2 data engine [8835](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8835) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Support/verify installing Longhorn Helm chart using helm-controller which is built in k3s and rke2 [9506](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9506) - @yangchiu @james-munson\r\n- [FEATURE] v2 volume supports auto salvage  [8430](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8430) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] v2 volumes supports DR volume [6613](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6613) - @c3y1huang @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Talos support for v2 data engine [7791](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/7791) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n- [FEATURE] Support Data Engine Option For Backing Image in CSI flow [10084](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10084) - @ChanYiLin @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Missing option to modify backup-task retain value from UI while editing recurring job [8810](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8810) - @houhoucoop @roger-ryao\r\n- [UI][FEATURE] Multiple backup stores support [8647](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8647) - @a110605 @roger-ryao\r\n- [UI][FEATURE] Support V2 Backing Image in UI [9880](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9880) - @yangchiu @chriscchien @houhoucoop\r\n- [FEATURE] Add periodic HugePages (2Mi) configuration check to ensure v2 data engine compatibility [9983](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9983) - @yangchiu @jangseon-ryu\r\n- [FEATURE][UI] Fill in the secret and secret namespace when restoring the BackupBackingImage [9490](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9490) - @chriscchien @houhoucoop\r\n- [FEATURE] Add kernel module check for data engine v2 [9915](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9915) - @jangseon-ryu @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE]: Automatic online filesystem resize for RWX volumes.

record feature and refactors and optimizes the configuration gray management to enable users to manage configuration releases and gray configurations more efficiently. It is important to note that this update may lead to certain changes in the database table structure used by Nacos, and the first startup after the upgrade may take some time for automatic data migration (this situation only applies to clusters that have used the beta gray feature in older versions).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above features, this version also includes significant optimizations and bug fixes for several other functions, including but not limited to the following:\r\n\r\n- Unified client addressing logic and provision of custom extension interfaces.\r\n- The client will automatically refresh the token when encountering a no-permission status during requests, without waiting for the token to expire.\r\n\r\nPlease see the details of the changes

Use `kubelet_{config_extra_args,custom_flags}` in `<your_inventory>/group_vars/kube_node.yml`.\r\n  The `{kube,system}_master_{cpu,memory,ephemeral-storage,pid}` are removed. Use the `{kube,system}_{cpu,memory,ephemeral-storage,pid}` variables in `<your_inventory>/group_vars/kube_control_plane.yml.\r\n  `kubelet_custom_flags` can no longer be a string, an array is required.

This method provides data restoration in case of missing parts while optimizing storage space:\r\n\r\n - `EC8+1`: Uses 112.5% of space,\r\n - `EC4+1`: Uses 125% of space,\r\n\r\nwhile maintaining the same level of hardware failure protection as standard replication (200%).\r\n\r\n### New Options in Storage Class Definitions\r\n\r\n- **`TRASH` State**: files in the MooseFS TRASH, so the deleted files that are retained for a configurable period of time, can now have custom storage definitions within a storage class.\r\n- **`ARCHIVE` State Configuration**: `ARCHIVE` state is now fully configurable:\r\n - Set file archive times based on last `atime`, `mtime`, or `ctime`.\r\n - Choose between `FAST` archival (ASAP) or `PER CHUNK`  based on `mtime`.\r\n - Exclude files below a certain length from being archived.\r\n - **Logical Expressions in Label Definitions**: Support for comprehensive logical expressions in label definitions is now available, allowing users to create more flexible and precise rules, providing greater control over how storage classes and states are applied to files. This includes the ability to use negations.\r\n - State-Specific Label Overrides: Override label modes (`STD`, `LOOSE`, `STRICT`) for specific states: `CREATE`, `KEEP`, `ARCHIVE`, or `TRASH`.\r\n\r\n### Storage Class Based on File Patterns\r\nUsers can now assign file storage classes dynamically based on custom file name patterns, providing greater flexibility in managing data. For example, files with a `.backup` extension could be assigned to a specific storage class with lower redundancy, while files starting with `important_` might be placed in a high-redundancy class.\r\n\r\n### Broadcast Mechanism for Server Restarts\r\nServer restarts (both chunk server and master) no longer block I/O until the end of chunk registration process.\r\n\r\n### Improved Chunk Format\r\nEnhanced handling of control sums for more secure chunk storage.\r\n\r\n### New Web-based Graphical User Interface with Dark Mode\r\nAdditional monitoring charts and system insights, offering improved chart systems and more detailed information. Moreover, dark mode is now available.\r\n\r\n### Multi-LAN Configuration\r\nSupport for clients across different LANs to remain within their LAN IP class while communicating with the master server. Can be used alongside the `remap` option known from MooseFS 3.x.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced IP Remap\r\nCustomizable IP-to-IP remapping instead of just fixed remapping of leading bits in IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Daemon Info\r\nMooseFS daemons instructed by an `info` signal can now generate detailed info files in working directory, listing configuration, state, and module data for enhanced troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### CS-Master Consistency Checks\r\nNew mechanism to ensure consistency between master and chunk server data held in RAM.\r\n\r\n### New `mfshdd.cfg` Options\r\nFlags with limits and options for disks with chunks shared with other processes, allowing better calculation of available/occupied space on disks.\r\n\r\n### New Offline Tool: `mfsmetasearch`\r\nAllows offline searches for files in metadata based on various conditions such as chunk IDs, inodes, and attributes.\r\n\r\n### Updated Logging System\r\nClear division of log messages by severity levels, with customizable logging options and syslog reporting.\r\n\r\n### New ACL Handling Tools\r\nUseful for operating systems without built-in ACL management tools.\r\n\r\n### General Algorithm Improvements\r\nNumerous improvements to algorithms for faster and more efficient MooseFS performance, especially in edge-case scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Quality of Life Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Faster Metadata Loading** at master server startup.\r\n- **`mfssupervisor` Tool** for on-demand metadata saves.\r\n- **`mfsfileinfo` Tool** can now display chunk paths on chunk servers.\r\n- **Enhanced Chunk Rebalance Algorithms**.\r\n- **More Configuration Options** for various operations and storage management.\r\n\r\n## Community Contributions\r\nDuring the development of this version, we received valuable feedback and suggestions from our community, many of which have been implemented. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to shaping this release of MooseFS!\r\n\r\n\r\n## MooseFS PRO\r\nIf you are looking for high availability (HA) for master servers, improved disk space management with enhanced data protection through EC configurations with higher redundancy levels, and dedicated support, we also offer MooseFS PRO version. This version is designed for enterprise environments where uptime and data integrity are critical, providing features like automatic failover for master servers, more advanced erasure coding for greater resilience against hardware failures, and professional support services to ensure smooth operation and rapid issue resolution. MooseFS PRO adds an extra layer of reliability and optimization for those managing large-scale, mission-critical storage systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe recommend to update your MooseFS clusters to this version.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPiotr / MooseFS Team", "created_at": "2024-09-23T10:07:48Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.7.0", "tag_name": "v2.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.7.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a regular minor version upgrade, mainly for feature enhancements and bug fixes.
