Upgrade existing server versions will handle the new storage format transparently. However, if a downgrade from 2.10.x occurs, the old version will not understand the format on disk with the exception 2.9.22 and any subsequent patch releases for 2.9. So if you upgrade from 2.9.x to 2.10.0 and then need to downgrade for some reason, it must be back to 2.9.22+ to ensure the stream data can be read correctly.\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n-

The top-level arguments `dynamodb_endpoint`, `iam_endpoint`, `endpoint` (fir S3), and `sts_endpoint` are now deprecated in favor of the nested equivalents. ([#30492](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30492))\n    * The backend now uses the following environment variables for overriding the default locations of AWS service endpoints used by the provider: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_IAM`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, and `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_STS`. The old non-standard names for these environment variables are now deprecated: `AWS_DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_IAM_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`, and `AWS_STS_ENDPOINT`. ([#30479](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30479))\n    * The singular `shared_credentials_file` argument is deprecated in favor of the plural `shared_credentials_files`.\n    * The `force_path_style` argument is deprecated in favor of `use_path_style` for consistency with the AWS SDK. ([#30491](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30491))\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n* `terraform test`: The `terraform test` command is now generally available. This comes with a significant change to how tests are written and executed, based on feedback from the experimental phase.\n\n    Terraform tests are written in `.tftest.hcl` files, containing a series of `run` blocks. Each `run` block executes a Terraform plan and optional apply against the Terraform configuration under test and can check conditions against the resulting plan and state.\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n* config: The `import` block `id` field now accepts expressions referring to other values such as resource attributes, as long as the value is a string known at plan time. ([#33618](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33618))\n* Terraform Cloud integration: Remote plans on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise can now be saved using the `-out` option, viewed using `terraform show`, and applied using `terraform apply` with the saved plan filename. ([#33492](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33492))\n* config: Terraform can now track some additional detail about values that won't be known until the apply step, such as the range of possible lengths for a collection or whether an unknown value can possibly be null.\n* core: Provider schemas can now be cached globally for compatible providers, allowing them to be reused throughout core without requesting them for each new provider instance. This can significantly reduce memory usage when there are many instances of the same provider in a single configuration ([#33482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33482))\n\n    When this information is available, Terraform can potentially generate known results for some operations on unknown values. This doesn't mean that Terraform can immediately track that detail in all cases, but the type system now supports that and so over time we can improve the level of detail generated by built-in functions, language operators, Terraform providers, etc. ([#33234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33234))\n* config: The `try` and `can` functions can now return more precise and consistent results when faced with unknown arguments ([#33758](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33758))\n* `terraform show -json`: Now includes `errored` property, indicating whether the planning process halted with an error. An errored plan is not applyable. ([#33372](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33372))\n* core: Terraform will now skip requesting the (possibly very large) provider schema from providers which indicate during handshake that they don't require that for correct behavior, in situations where Terraform Core itself does not need the schema. ([#33486](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33486))\n* backend/kubernetes: The Kubernetes backend is no longer limited to storing states below 1MiB in size, and can now scale by splitting state across multiple secrets. ([#29678](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/29678))\n* backend/s3: Various improvements for consistency with `hashicorp/aws` provider capabilities:\n    * `assume_role_with_web_identity` nested block for assuming a role with dynamic credentials such as a JSON Web Token. ([#31244](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31244))\n    * Now honors the standard AWS environment variables for credential and configuration files: `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. ([#30493](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30493))\n    * `shared_config_files` and `shared_credentials_files` arguments for specifying credential and configuration files as part of the backend configuration. ([#30493](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30493))\n    * Internally the backend now uses AWS SDK for Go v2, which should address various other missing behaviors that are handled by the SDK rather than by Terraform itself. ([#30443](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30443))\n    * `custom_ca_bundle` argument and support for the corresponding AWS environment variable, `AWS_CA_BUNDLE`, for providing custom root and intermediate certificates. ([#33689](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33689))\n    * `ec2_metadata_service_endpoint` and `ec2_metadata_service_endpoint_mode` arguments and support for the corresponding AWS environment variables, `AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` and `AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_MODE` for setting the EC2 metadata service (IMDS) endpoint. The environment variable `AWS_METADATA_URL` is also supported for compatibility with the AWS provider, but is deprecated. ([#30444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30444))\n    * `http_proxy`, `insecure`, `use_fips_endpoint`, and `use_dualstack_endpoint` arguments and support for the corresponding environment variables, `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, which enable custom HTTP proxy configurations and the resolution of AWS endpoints with extended capabilities. ([#30496](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30496))\n    * `sts_region` argument to use an alternative region for STS operations. ([#33693](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33693))\n    * `retry_mode` argument and support for the corresponding `AWS_RETRY_MODE` environment variable to configure how retries are attempted. ([#33692](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33692))\n    * `allowed_account_ids` and `forbidden_account_ids` arguments to prevent unintended modifications to specified environments. ([#33688](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33688))\n* backend/cos: Support custom HTTP(S) endpoint and root domain for the API client. ([#33656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33656))\n\nBUG FIXES:\n* core: Transitive dependencies were lost during apply when the referenced resource expanded into zero instances. ([#33403](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33403))\n* cli: Terraform will no longer override SSH settings in local git configuration when installing modules. ([#33592](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33592))\n* `terraform` built-in provider: The upstream dependency that Terraform uses for service discovery of Terraform-native services such as Terraform Cloud/Enterprise state storage was previously not concurrency-safe, but Terraform was treating it as if it was in situations like when a configuration has multiple `terraform_remote_state` blocks all using the \"remote\" backend. Terraform is now using a newer version of that library which updates its internal caches in a concurrency-safe way. ([#33364](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33364))\n* `terraform init`: Terraform will no longer allow downloading remote modules to invalid paths. ([#33745](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33745))\n* Ignore potential remote terraform version mismatch when running force-unlock ([#28853](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28853))\n* cloud: Fixed a bug that would prevent nested symlinks from being dereferenced into the config sent to Terraform Cloud ([#31895](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31895))\n* cloud: state snapshots could not be disabled when header x-terraform-snapshot-interval is absent ([#33820](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33820))\n\n## Previous Releases\n\nFor information on prior major and minor releases, see their changelogs:\n\n* [v1.5](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.5/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v1.4](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.4/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v1.3](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.3/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v1.2](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.2/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v1.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.1/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v1.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v0.15](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.15/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v0.14](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.14/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v0.13](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.13/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v0.12](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.12/CHANGELOG.md)\n* [v0.11 and earlier](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.11/CHANGELOG.md)\n", "created_at": "2023-10-04T16:30:07Z", "project": "Terraform", "repo": "hashicorp/terraform", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.0.0alpha6", "html_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/commit/cf4c50ece539d86f04d88401045c703b5ae4cfe9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\n**Rancher v2.7.8 is a mirror release of [v2.7.7](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.7) with one change to address a known issue in v2.7.7. This issue affected node-provisioned clusters for certain cloud infrastructure providers.**\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where Rancher failed to provision EC2/vSphere clusters. See [#43019](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43019) for details.\r\n\r\n  > Note: If you were previously running a downstream vSphere cluster, installed or upgraded to Rancher v2.7.7, and, as a [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43019#issuecomment-1747670801), set the `rancher/machine` version to `0.15.0-rancher105` via the `CATTLE_MACHINE_PROVISION_IMAGE` environment variable, the vSphere downstream clusters will be provisioned again upon upgrade to Rancher v2.7.8.\r\n\r\n<!--# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n# Known Issues-->\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter (such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later), upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0, which supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command, to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the privileged flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Reverting the Active Directory Migration Delivered in v2.7.5\r\n\r\nThe following information *only* applies if you are upgrading from Rancher v2.7.5. It does *not* apply if you are upgrading directly to the latest Rancher version from v2.7.4 or earlier, or if you are upgrading to the latest Rancher version from v2.7.6.\r\n\r\nRancher v2.7.6 and later contain a reverse migration utility that runs at startup. Data migration is only triggered if you have been on Rancher v2.7.5.\r\n\r\nUsers will be corrected from the v2.7.5 data migration, which updated personalIDs to use GUIDs instead of Distinguished Names (DNs). Rancher v2.7.6 and later fix bugs related to the inability to login for various reasons. See [#41985](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41985) and [#42120](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42120). \r\n\r\n**Important:** If you disabled AD authentication while on v2.7.5, don't enable it after upgrading until after the utility is run. Doing so will cause the reverse migration to fail to clean up the remaining bad data.\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that you directly upgrade to the latest version of Rancher v2.7.x, especially if you're on a broken or partially downgraded Rancher setup after upgrading to v2.7.5. Allow the startup utility to revert the Active Directory changes to restore functionality to your setup. \r\n\r\nEven if you're currently on Rancher v2.7.5 and your setup wasn't broken by the Active Directory changes, you should still upgrade to v2.7.6 or later and allow the startup utility to revert the migration.\r\n\r\nThe reverse migration startup utility saves all relevant changes to Rancher if it finds GUID-based users in Active Directory. The users' data (including the user object, all bindings, and tokens) return a Distinguished Name as the principalID. If the LDAP connection permanently fails during execution of the utility, Rancher automatically retries the utility several times with exponential backoff. Missing users are left behind and reported to the local admin for manual review.\r\n\r\nIf you need to clean up any missing users following an upgrade to the latest Rancher version, contact support.\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- The `cluster-api` core provider controllers are now run in a pod in the `cattle-provisioning-cattle-system` namespace, within the local cluster. These controllers are installed with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/rancher/provisioning). Previously, Rancher ran `cluster-api` controllers in an embedded fashion. This change makes it easier to maintain `cluster-api` versioning. See [#41094](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41094). <!-- team/area2 -->\r\n- Changed the token hashing algorithm to generate new tokens using SHA3. Existing tokens will not be re-hashed. This change affects ClusterAuthTokens (the downstream synced version of tokens for ACE) and Tokens (only when token hashing is enabled). SHA3 tokens should work with ACE and Token Hashing. Existing tokens which don't use SHA3 may not work when ACE and token hashing are used in combination. If, after upgrading to Rancher v2.7.7, you experience issues with ACE while Token Hashing is enabled, you should re-generate any applicable tokens. See [#42062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/42062). <!-- team/area1 --><!-- team/scaling -->\r\n- If you use a version of backup restore older than v102.0.2+up3.1.2 to take a backup of Rancher v2.7.7, the migration will encounter a `capi-webhook` error. Make sure that the chart version used for backups is v102.0.2+up3.1.2, which has `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources removed from the resourceSet. If you can't use v102.0.2+up3.1.2 for backups, delete all `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources from the backup tar before using it. See [#382](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/pull/382).\r\n- Rancher installs the same pinned version of the `rancher-webhook` chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Note that restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions ideally need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n- The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n- You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n- The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s now respects the `managedBy` annotation. Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround in its initial release to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false` since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n- Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n- Privilege escalation is now disabled by default when creating deployments. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n- Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n  - Rancher now aggregates the changed counts and only send a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n  - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, causing significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n- When provisioning downstream clusters, the cluster name must now conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n- In previous versions, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging, instead of Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some  necessary actions within Azure AD. This will cause errors.\r\n- Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters. The default behavior has been changed, so that if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.8\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.7](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.7)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.10](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.10)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n- v1.26.8 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.13\r\n- v1.24.17\r\n- v1.23.16\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n- v1.26.9 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.14\r\n- v1.24.17\r\n- v1.23.17\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- The SAML authentication pop-up throws a `404` error on high-availability RKE installations. Single node Docker installations aren't affected. If you refresh the browser window and select **Resend**, the authentication request will succeed, and you will be able to log in. See [#31163](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31163).\r\n- Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).<!-- team/area2 -->\r\n- Users on certain LDAP setups don't have permission to search LDAP. When they attempt to perform a search, they receive the error message, `Result Code 32 \"No Such Object\"`. See [#35259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35259). <!-- team/area3 -->\r\n- Target customization can produce custom resources that exceed the Rancher API's maximum bundle size. This results in `Request entity too large` errors when attempting to add a GitHub repo. Only target customizations that modify the Helm chart URL or version are affected. As a workaround, use multiple paths or GitHub repos instead of target customization. See [#1650](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1650).\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.7.2, a webhook will now be installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher >= v2.7.2 to a version < v2.7.2, you'll experience an issue where the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after Rancher version < v2.7.2 is running) to remove the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n  - **Any distribution - Windows:**\r\n    - Downstream Windows clusters get stuck after a Rancher upgrade. Windows nodes become stuck in an unavailable state, with an `failed to list *v1.ConfigMap: configmaps \"kube-root-ca.crt\" is forbidden` error message. As a workaround, reboot the node. See [#42426](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42426). \r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE and RKE2:**\r\n    - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **RKE2 and K3s:**\r\n    - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. However, there is a [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) for fixing these node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n    - Scaling down etcd nodes on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters may inadvertently delete all etcd nodes in the pool. This is linked to an [upstream cluster-api bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/9334) that causes the controllers to delete more than the desired quantity of etcd nodes when reconciling an RKE Machine Pool. This issue affects etcd node scale-down operations on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters. To help mitigate the issue, have a robust backup strategy and store your etcd snapshots in a safe location. See [#42582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42582).\r\n    - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).\r\n    - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n        - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n        - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - Clusters are in an `Updating` state even when it contains nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020029) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n<!-- - **Infrastructures:** -->\r\n  <!-- - **vSphere:**-->\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Authentication:**\r\n    - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after configuring another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup annotation with the unlocked value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - When updating Rancher, sometimes Fleet is not upgraded to the latest version. See [#1590](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1590). To ensure you upgrade Fleet:\r\n      1. Refresh the `rancher-charts` catalog resource.\r\n      1. Go to **Apps**, select **All Workspaces**, and note the versions of `fleet-crd` and `fleet-chart`.\r\n      1. Select the dot menu to select **Upgrade** to check if there is a newer Fleet version listed.\r\n      1. Update the `fleet` chart. Fleet will automatically update the agents.\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. During an upgrade, this is a benign error and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - - When enabling some custom node drivers, the Cloud Credential creation page does not show the correct default fields and has an uneditable foo key. See [#8563](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8563).\r\n  - You need to force-refresh the Rancher UI after initial Rancher setup, to trigger the prompt to accept the self-signed certificate. As a workaround, visit the Rancher portal, accept the self-signed certificate, and go through the setup process. Once done, go to the address bar of your browser and click the lock icon. Select the option to allow you to receive certificate errors for the Rancher website. You'll then be prompted again to accept the new certificate. See [#7867](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7867).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and selectinging Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n  - Removed legacy feature multi-cluster app. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).", "created_at": "2023-10-02T21:10:39Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.94.0", "tag_name": "v1.94.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.94.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "Released at 2023-10-02\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): add support for numbers with underscore delimiters such as `1_234_567_890` and `1.234_567_890`. These numbers are easier to read than `1234567890` and `1.234567890`.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html): add support for server-side copy of existing backups. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html#server-side-copy-of-the-existing-backup) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the option to see the latest 25 queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4718).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add ability to set `member num` label for all the metrics scraped by a particular `vmagent` instance in [a cluster of vmagents](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#scraping-big-number-of-targets) via `-promscrape.cluster.memberLabel` command-line flag. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#scraping-big-number-of-targets) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4247).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not log `unexpected EOF` when reading incoming metrics, since this error is expected and is handled during metrics' parsing. This reduces the amounts of noisy logs. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4817).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): retry failed write request on the closed connection immediately, without waiting for backoff. This should improve data delivery speed and reduce amount of error logs emitted by vmagent when using idle connections. See related [issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4139).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): reduces load on Kubernetes control plane during initial service discovery. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4855) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): reduce the maximum recovery time at `vmselect` and `vminsert` when some of `vmstorage` nodes become unavailable because of networking issues from 60 seconds to 3 seconds by default. The recovery time can be tuned at `vmselect` and `vminsert` nodes with `-vmstorageUserTimeout` command-line flag if needed. Thanks to @wjordan for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/4423).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add Prometheus data support to the \"Explore cardinality\" page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4320) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): make the warning message more noticeable for text fields. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4848).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add button for auto-formatting PromQL/MetricsQL queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4681). Thanks to @aramattamara for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/4694).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve accessibility score to 100 according to [Google's Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/) tests.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): organize `min`, `max`, `median` values on the chart legend and tooltips for better visibility.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add explanation about [cardinality explorer](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-explorer) statistic inaccuracy in VictoriaMetrics cluster. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3070).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add storage of query history in `localStorage`. See [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5022).\r\n* FEATURE: dashboards: provide copies of Grafana dashboards alternated with VictoriaMetrics datasource at [dashboards/vm](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/dashboards/vm).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): added ability to set, override and clear request and response headers on a per-user and per-path basis. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4825) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html#auth-config) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): add ability to retry requests to the [remaining backends](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html#load-balancing) if they return response status codes specified in the `retry_status_codes` list. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4893).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): expose metrics `vmauth_config_last_reload_*` for tracking the state of config reloads, similarly to vmagent/vmalert components.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): do not print logs like `SIGHUP received...` once per configured `-configCheckInterval` cmd-line flag. This log will be printed only if config reload was invoked manually.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): add `eval_offset` attribute for [Groups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#groups). If specified, Group will be evaluated at the exact time offset on the range of [0...evaluationInterval]. The setting might be useful for cron-like rules which must be evaluated at specific moments of time. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3409) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): validate [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) function names in alerting and recording rules when `vmalert` runs with `-dryRun` command-line flag. Previously it was allowed to use unknown (aka invalid) MetricsQL function names there. For example, `foo()` was counted as a valid query. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4933).\r\n* FEATURE: limit the length of string params in log messages to 500 chars. Longer string params are replaced with the `first_250_chars..last_250_chars`. This prevents from too long log lines, which can be emitted by VictoriaMetrics components.\r\n* FEATURE: [docker compose environment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker): add `vmauth` component to cluster's docker-compose example for balancing load among multiple `vmselect` components.\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): make sure that `q2` series are returned after `q1` series in the results of `q1 or q2` query, in the same way as Prometheus does. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4763).\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): return empty result from [`bitmap_and(a, b)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#bitmap_and), [`bitmap_or(a, b)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#bitmap_or) and [`bitmap_xor(a, b)`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#bitmap_xor) if `a` or `b` have no value at the particular timestamp. Previously `0` was returned in this case. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4996).\r\n* FEATURE: stop exposing `vm_merge_need_free_disk_space` metric, since it has been appeared that it confuses users while doesn't bring any useful information. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/686#issuecomment-1733844128).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [Official Grafana dashboards for VictoriaMetrics](https://grafana.com/orgs/victoriametrics): fix display of ingested rows rate for `Samples ingested/s` and `Samples rate` panels for vmagent's dasbhoard. Previously, not all ingested protocols were accounted in these panels. An extra panel `Rows rate` was added to `Ingestion` section to display the split for rows ingested rate by protocol.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix the bug causing render looping when switching to heatmap.\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html) validate `-dedup.minScrapeInterval` value and `-downsampling.period` intervals are multiples of each other. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmbackup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html): properly copy `appliedRetention.txt` files inside `<-storageDataPath>/{data}` folders during [incremental backups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html#incremental-backups). Previously the new `appliedRetention.txt` could be skipped during incremental backups, which could lead to increased load on storage after restoring from backup. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5005).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): suppress `context canceled` error messages in logs when `vmagent` is reloading service discovery config. This error could appear starting from [v1.93.5](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.5). See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/5048).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): remove concurrency limit during parsing of scraped metrics, which was mistakenly applied to it. With this change cmd-line flag `-maxConcurrentInserts` won't have effect on scraping anymore.\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): allow passing [median_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#median_over_time) to [aggr_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#aggr_over_time). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5034).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vminsert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): fix ingestion via [multitenant url](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy-via-labels) for opentsdbhttp. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5061). The bug has been introduced in [v1.93.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.93.2).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): fix support of legacy DataDog agent, which adds trailing slashes to urls. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5078).

Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.\r\n\r\nThe community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there!\r\n\r\n- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\r\n  -  for questions and just to hang out\r\n  -  for discussing PRs, code, and bugs\r\n- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/696660622)\r\n- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [ArtifactHub/packages](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0)\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n- The `--dry-run` flag now has multiple options which can enable Helm to connect to a Kubernetes instance. The default, when `--dry-run` is used, is unchanged.\r\n- Values handling had numerous issues fixed and now consistently has a priority of (1) User specified values (e.g CLI), (2) imported values, (3) parent chart values, and (4) subchart values. Additionally, null can now consistently be used to remove values.\r\n- Can work with OCI registries over HTTP using the `--plain-http` flag\r\n- Helm now adds the OCI creation annotation\r\n- New `helm get metadata` command\r\n- The SQL driver now only needs write on the first run or when the schema is updated\r\n- Added labels support for install and upgrade commands\r\n- The ability to have index.yaml holding JSON content instead of YAML using the `--json` flag when creating it. JSON is faster to parse and uses less memory which impacts larger files. This is backwards compatible as Helm, all the way back to 3.0.0, parsing can handle JSON content in the index.yaml file.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Upgrading\r\n\r\nDownload Helm v3.13.0.

in the Falco image and/or can be downloaded via falcoctl as `falco-rules` is now a _stable_ rule file. This file **contains a much smaller number of rules** that are less noisy and have been vetted by the community. This serves as a much requested \"starter\" Falco rule set that covers many common use case. The rest of that file has been expanded and split into `falco-incubating-rules` and `falco-sandbox-rules`. For more information, see the [rules repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules)\r\n- The main `falcosecurity/falco` container image and its `falco-driver-loader` counterpart have been upgraded. Now they are able to compile the kernel module or classic eBPF probe for relatively newer version of the kernel (5.x and above) while we no longer ship toolchains to compile the kernel module for older versions in the default images. Downloading of prebuilt drivers and the modern eBPF will work exactly like before. The older image, meant for compatibility with older kernels (4.x and below), is currently retained as `falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader-legacy`.\r\n- The Falco HTTP output no longer logs to stdout by default for performance reasons. You can set stdout logging preferences and restore the previous behavior with the configuration option `http_output.echo` in `falco.yaml`.\r\n- The `--list-syscall-events` command line option has been replaced by `--list-events` which prints all supported system events (syscall, tracepoints, metaevents, internal plugin events) in addition to extra information about flags.\r\n- The semantics of `proc.exepath` have changed. Now that field contains the executable path on disk even if the binary was launched from a symbolic link.\r\n- The `-d` daemonize option has been removed.\r\n- The `stats` command line option (`-s`, `--stats-interval`) has been removed in favor of metrics configs in `falco.yaml`\r\n- The `-p` option is now changed:\r\n    - when only `-pc` is set Falco will print `container_id=%container.id container_image=%container.image.repository container_image_tag=%container.image.tag container_name=%container.name`\r\n    - when `-pk` is set it will print as above, but with `k8s_ns=%k8s.ns.name k8s_pod_name=%k8s.pod.name` appended\r\n\r\n\r\n### Major Changes\r\n\r\n\r\n* new(falco-driver-loader): --source-only now prints the values as env vars [[#2353](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2353)] - [@steakunderscore](https://github.com/steakunderscore)\r\n* new(docker): allow passing options to falco-driver-loader from the driver loader cointainer [[#2781](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2781)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* new(docker): add experimental falco-distroless image based on Wolfi [[#2768](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2768)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* new: the legacy falco image is available as driver-loader-legacy [[#2718](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2718)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* new: added option to enable/disable echoing of server answer to stdout (disabled by default) when using HTTP output [[#2602](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2602)] - [@FedeDP](https://github.com/FedeDP)\r\n* new: support systemctl reload for Falco services [[#2588](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2588)] - [@jabdr](https://github.com/jabdr)\r\n* new(falco/config): add new configurations for http_output that allow mTLS [[#2633](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2633)] - [@annadorottya](https://github.com/annadorottya)\r\n* new: allow falco to match multiple rules on same event [[#2705](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2705)] - [@loresuso](https://github.com/loresuso)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minor Changes\r\n\r\n* update(cmake): bumped bundled falcoctl to 0.6.2 [[#2829](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2829)] - [@FedeDP](https://github.com/FedeDP)\r\n* update(rules)!: major rule update to version 2.0.0 [[#2823](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2823)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* update(cmake): bumped plugins to latest stable versions [[#2820](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2820)] - [@FedeDP](https://github.com/FedeDP)\r\n* update(cmake): bumped libs to 0.13.0-rc2 and driver to 6.0.1+driver [[#2806](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2806)] - [@FedeDP](https://github.com/FedeDP)\r\n* update!: default substitution for `%container.info` is now equal `container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name` [[#2793](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2793)] - [@leogr](https://github.com/leogr)\r\n* update!: the --list-syscall-events flag is now called --list-events and lists all events [[#2771](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2771)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* update!: the Falco base image is now based on Debian 12 with gcc 11-12 [[#2718](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2718)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* update(docker): the Falco no-driver image is now based on Debian 12 [[#2782](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2782)] - [@LucaGuerra](https://github.com/LucaGuerra)\r\n* feat(userspace)!: remove `-d` daemonize option [[#2677](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2677)] - [@incertum](https://github.com/incertum)\r\n* build(deps): Bump submodules/falcosecurity-rules from 3f52480 to 0d0e333 [[#2693](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2693)] - [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/apps/dependabot)\r\n* build(deps): Bump submodules/falcosecurity-rules from 3f52480 to b42893a [[#2756](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2756)] - [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/apps/dependabot)\r\n* build(deps): Bump submodules/falcosecurity-rules from b42893a to 6ed73fe [[#2780](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/2780)] - [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/apps/dependabot)\r\n* update(cmake): bumped libs to 0.13.0-rc1 and driver to 6.0.0+driver.

This could have disrupted communication between the Portainer server and agent after a restoration from backup. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10335\r\n- Improved the upgrade process for the Portainer server, upgrade process now halts on database migration errors, preventing database version mismatches for a more stable environment. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10336\r\n- Fixed an issue where toggles could be activated outside of their intended component area, potentially leading to inadvertent toggling. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10324\r\n\r\n# Rest API Changes\r\n- Fixed an issue introduced in 2.19.0 when Kubernetes environment metrics API features were enabled, where these features would return an \u2018Unable to reach metrics API\u2019 error.\r\n- Introduced new format around the change of a user\u2019s password via API. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10326\r\n- Updated the checking around change of a user via API. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10326\r\n- Fixed API endpoints that were broken in the 2.19.0 release, ensuring that they retain their previous functionality. https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/10337\r\n", "created_at": "2023-09-19T23:46:55Z", "project": "Portainer", "repo": "portainer/portainer", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.16.2", "tag_name": "v1.16.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.16.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul", "body": "## 1.16.2 (September 19, 2023)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n* Upgrade to use Go 1.20.8.

[[GH-18625](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18625)]\n* Reduce the frequency of metric exports from Consul to HCP from every 10s to every 1m [[GH-18584](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18584)]\n* api: Add support for listing ACL tokens by service name. [[GH-18667](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18667)]\n* checks: It is now possible to configure agent TCP checks to use TLS with\noptional server SNI and mutual authentication. To use TLS with a TCP check, the\ncheck must enable the `tcp_use_tls` boolean. By default the agent will use the\nTLS configuration in the `tls.default` stanza. [[GH-18381](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18381)]\n* command: Adds -since flag in consul debug command which internally calls hcdiag for debug information in the past. [[GH-18797](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18797)]\n* log: Currently consul logs files like this consul-{timestamp}.log. This change makes sure that there is always\nconsul.log file with the latest logs in it. [[GH-18617](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18617)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* Inherit locality from services when registering sidecar proxies. [[GH-18437](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18437)]\n* UI : Nodes list view was breaking for synthetic-nodes. Fix handles non existence of consul-version meta for node. [[GH-18464](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18464)]\n* api: Fix `/v1/agent/self` not returning latest configuration [[GH-18681](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18681)]\n* ca: Vault provider now cleans up the previous Vault issuer and key when generating a new leaf signing certificate [[GH-18779](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18779)] [[GH-18773](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18773)]\n* check: prevent go routine leakage when existing Defercheck of same check id is not nil [[GH-18558](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18558)]\n* connect: Fix issue where Envoy endpoints would not populate correctly after a snapshot restore. [[GH-18636](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18636)]\n* gateways: Fix a bug where gateway to service mappings weren't being cleaned up properly when externally registered proxies were being deregistered. [[GH-18831](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/18831)]\n* telemetry: emit consul version metric on a regular interval.

ports.\r\nPreviously, Contour only allowed a single port for HTTP, and a single port for HTTPS/TLS.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the following Gateway, with two HTTP ports and two HTTPS ports, is now fully supported:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: Gateway\r\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: contour\r\nspec:\r\n  gatewayClassName: contour\r\n  listeners:\r\n    - name: http-1\r\n      protocol: HTTP\r\n      port: 80\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: Same\r\n    - name: http-2\r\n      protocol: HTTP\r\n      port: 81\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: Same\r\n    - name: https-1\r\n      protocol: HTTPS\r\n      port: 443\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: Same\r\n      tls:\r\n        mode: Terminate\r\n        certificateRefs:\r\n        - name: tls-cert-1\r\n    - name: https-2\r\n      protocol: HTTPS\r\n      port: 444\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: Same\r\n      tls:\r\n        mode: Terminate\r\n        certificateRefs:\r\n        - name: tls-cert-2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using the Contour Gateway Provisioner, ports for all valid Listeners will automatically be exposed via the Envoy service, and will update when any Listener changes are made.\r\nIf you are using static provisioning, you must keep the Service definition in sync with the Gateway spec manually.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are using the Contour Gateway Provisioner along with HTTPProxy or Ingress for routing, then your Gateway must have exactly one HTTP Listener and one HTTPS Listener.\r\nFor this case, Contour supports a custom HTTPS Listener protocol value, to avoid having to specify TLS details in the Listener (since they're specified in the HTTPProxy or Ingress instead):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: Gateway\r\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: contour-with-httpproxy\r\nspec:\r\n  gatewayClassName: contour\r\n  listeners:\r\n    - name: http\r\n      protocol: HTTP\r\n      port: 80\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: All\r\n    - name: https\r\n      protocol: projectcontour.io/https\r\n      port: 443\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: All\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5160, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## Contour now outputs metrics about status update load\r\n\r\nMetrics on status update counts and duration are now output by the xDS server.\r\nThis should enable deployments at scale to diagnose delays in status updates and possibly tune the `--kubernetes-client-qps` and `--kubernetes-client-burst` flags.\r\n\r\n(#5037, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Watching specific namespaces\r\n\r\nThe `contour serve` command takes a new optional flag, `--watch-namespaces`, that can\r\nbe used to restrict the namespaces where the Contour instance watches for resources.\r\nConsequently, resources in other namespaces will not be known to Contour and will not\r\nbe acted upon.\r\n\r\nYou can watch a single or multiple namespaces, and you can further restrict the root\r\nnamespaces with `--root-namespaces` just like before. Root namespaces must be a subset\r\nof the namespaces being watched, for example:\r\n\r\n`--watch-namespaces=my-admin-namespace,my-app-namespace --root-namespaces=my-admin-namespace`\r\n\r\nIf the `--watch-namespaces` flag is not used, then all namespaces will be watched by default.\r\n\r\n(#5214, @nsimons)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: Implement Regex Path Matching and Regex Header Matching.\r\n\r\nThis Change Adds 2 features to HTTPProxy\r\n1. Regex based path matching.\r\n1. Regex based header matching.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Path Matching\r\n\r\nIn addition to `prefix` and `exact`, HTTPProxy now also support `regex`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Root Proxies\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: root-regex-match\r\nspec:\r\n  fqdn: local.projectcontour.io\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      # matches\r\n      # - /list/1234\r\n      # - /list/\r\n      # - /list/foobar\r\n      # and so on and so forth\r\n      - regex: /list/.*\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s1\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      # matches\r\n      # - /admin/dev\r\n      # - /admin/prod\r\n      - regex: /admin/(prod|dev)\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s2\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Inclusion\r\n\r\n##### Root\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: root-regex-match\r\nspec:\r\n  fqdn: local.projectcontour.io\r\n  includes:\r\n  - name: child-regex-match\r\n    conditions:\r\n    - prefix: /child\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - prefix: /\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s1\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Included\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: child-regex-match\r\nspec:\r\n  fqdn: local.projectcontour.io\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      # matches\r\n      # - /child/list/1234\r\n      # - /child/list/\r\n      # - /child/list/foobar\r\n      # and so on and so forth\r\n      - regex: /list/.*\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s1\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      # matches\r\n      # - /child/admin/dev\r\n      # - /child/admin/prod\r\n      - regex: /admin/(prod|dev)\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s2\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      # matches\r\n      # - /child/bar/stats\r\n      # - /child/foo/stats\r\n      # and so on and so forth\r\n      - regex: /.*/stats\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s3\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Header Regex Matching\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: httpproxy-header-matching\r\nspec:\r\n  fqdn: local.projectcontour.io\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # matches header `x-header` with value of `dev-value` or `prod-value`\r\n           name: x-header\r\n          regex: (dev|prod)-value\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s4\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5319, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## Adds critical level for access logging\r\n\r\nNew critical access log level was introduced to reduce the volume of logs for busy installations. Critical level produces access logs for response status >= 500.\r\n\r\n(#5360, @davinci26)\r\n\r\n## Default Global RateLimit Policy\r\n\r\nThis Change adds the ability to define a default global rate limit policy in the Contour configuration \r\nto be used as a global rate limit policy by all HTTPProxy objects.\r\nHTTPProxy object can decide to opt out and disable this feature using `disabled` config.\r\n\r\n### Sample Configurations\r\n#### contour.yaml\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: ConfigMap\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: contour\r\n  namespace: projectcontour\r\ndata:\r\n  contour.yaml: |\r\n    rateLimitService:\r\n      extensionService: projectcontour/ratelimit\r\n      domain: contour\r\n      failOpen: false\r\n      defaultGlobalRateLimitPolicy:\r\n        descriptors:\r\n          - entries:\r\n              - remoteAddress: {}\r\n          - entries:\r\n              - genericKey:\r\n                  value: foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5363, @shadialtarsha)\r\n\r\n## Contour supports setting the MaxRequestsPerConnection\r\n\r\nSupport setting of MaxRequestsPerConnection on listeners or clusters via the contour configuration.\r\n\r\n(#5417, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## Failures to automatically set GOMAXPROCS are no longer fatal\r\n\r\nIn some (particularly local development) environments the [automaxprocs](https://github.com/uber-go/automaxprocs) library fails due to the cgroup namespace setup.\r\nThis failure is no longer fatal for Contour.\r\nContour will now simply log the error and continue with the automatic GOMAXPROCS detection ignored.\r\n\r\n(#5427, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Routes with HTTP Method matching have higher precedence\r\n\r\nFor conformance with Gateway API v0.7.1+, routes that utilize HTTP method matching now have an explicit precedence over routes with header/query matches.\r\nSee the [Gateway API documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/v0.7.1/apis/v1beta1/httproute_types.go#L163-L167) for a description of this precedence order.\r\n\r\nThis change applies not only to HTTPRoute but also HTTPProxy method matches (implemented in configuration via a header match on the `:method` header).\r\n\r\n(#5434, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Host header including port is passed through unmodified to backend\r\n\r\nPreviously Contour would strip any port from the Host header in a downstream request for convenience in routing.\r\nThis resulted in backends not receiving the Host header with a port.\r\nWe no longer do this, for conformance with Gateway API (this change also applies to HTTPProxy and Ingress configuration).\r\n\r\n(#5437, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: add TCPRoute support\r\n\r\nContour now supports Gateway API's [TCPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/) resource.\r\nThis route type provides simple TCP forwarding for traffic received on a given Listener port.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple example of a Gateway and TCPRoute configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: Gateway\r\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: contour\r\n  namespace: projectcontour\r\nspec:\r\n  gatewayClassName: contour\r\n  listeners:\r\n    - name: tcp-listener\r\n      protocol: TCP\r\n      port: 10000\r\n      allowedRoutes:\r\n        namespaces:\r\n          from: All\r\n---\r\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2\r\nkind: TCPRoute\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: echo-1\r\n  namespace: default\r\nspec:\r\n  parentRefs:\r\n  - namespace: projectcontour\r\n    name: contour\r\n    sectionName: tcp-listener\r\n  rules:\r\n  - backendRefs:\r\n    - name: s1\r\n      port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5471, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: Support TLS termination with TLSRoute and TCPRoute\r\n\r\nContour now supports using TLSRoute and TCPRoute in combination with TLS termination.\r\nTo use this feature, create a Gateway with a Listener like the following:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: tls-listener\r\n  protocol: TLS\r\n  port: 5000\r\n  tls:\r\n    mode: Terminate\r\n    certificateRefs:\r\n    - name: tls-cert-secret\r\n  allowedRoutes:\r\n    namespaces:\r\n      from: All\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is then possible to attach either 1+ TLSRoutes, or a single TCPRoute, to this Listener.\r\nIf using TLSRoute, traffic can be routed to a different backend based on SNI.\r\nIf using TCPRoute, all traffic is forwarded to the backend referenced in the route.\r\n\r\n(#5481, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Allow setting of `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` value for Clusters\r\n\r\nAllow changing `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` for all Clusters. Default is not set to keep compatibility with existing configurations. Envoy [recommends](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/best_practices/edge) setting to 32KiB for Edge proxies.\r\n\r\n(#5493, @rajatvig)\r\n\r\n## Allow setting of `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` value for Listeners\r\n\r\nAllow changing `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` for Listeners. Default is not set to keep compatibility with existing configurations.\r\nEnvoy [recommends](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/best_practices/edge) setting to 32KiB for Edge proxies.\r\n\r\n(#5513, @rajatvig)\r\n\r\n## Fix order of Global ExtAuth and Global Ratelimit\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the order of execution of extauth and global ratelimit is the same across HTTP and HTTPS virtualhosts, which is Auth goes first then Global ratelimit. (#5559, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## Adds support for case-insensitive header matching\r\n\r\nAdds support for `IgnoreCase` in route header matching condition.

These include metrics around API Server requests, leader election, and individual resource controllers. (#5006, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: add a container port to the Envoy daemonset/deployment for the metrics port. (#5101, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes annotations configurability to ContourDeployment resource. to enable customize pod annotations for pod/contour (#5346, @izturn)\r\n- Add configuration for socket options to support DSCP marking for outbound IP packets, for both IPv4 (TOS field) and IPv6 (Traffic Class field). (#5352, @tsaarni)\r\n- Gateway API: Add `ipFamilyPolicy` field to `ContourDeployment.spec.envoy.networkPublishing` to control dual-stack-ness of the generated service. (#5386, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: set the default resource requirements for containers: shutdown-manager & envoy-initconfig (#5425, @izturn)\r\n- DAG rebuild fixes: Update of CRL Secret did not trigger reload when it was not co-located in the same Secret with CA certificate, update of TLS Secret did not trigger reload when using `Ingress.spec.tls.secretName` with certificate delegation and `projectcontour.io/tls-cert-namespace` annotation. (#5463, @tsaarni)\r\n- Certgen job name in example deployment manifest is now generated using pattern `contour-certgen-v1-26-0` instead of `contour-certgen-v1.26.0` to follow Kubernetes pod naming rules. (#5484, @tsaarni)\r\n- Service change now triggers update for GRPCRoute. (#5485, @yanggangtony)\r\n- HTTPProxy: support fractional mirroring to a service by specifying `mirror: true` and a `weight` of 1-100. See the [traffic mirroring docs](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.26/config/request-routing/#traffic-mirroring) for more information. (#5516, @hshamji)\r\n- Gateway API: enable websockets upgrade by default. (#5524, @skriss)\r\n- HTTPProxy: HTTP health checks can now be configured to treat response codes other than 200 as healthy. See [HTTPProxy Health Checking](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.26/config/health-checks/#http-proxy-health-checking) and [HTTPHealthCheckPolicy reference docs](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.26/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.HTTPHealthCheckPolicy) for more information. (#5528, @skriss)\r\n- Refactor the handling of cross-namespace references and improve documentation. (#5529, @tsaarni)\r\n- The maximum TLS version on Envoy Listeners can be configured. Valid options are TLS versions `1.2` and `1.3` with a default of `1.3`. (#5533, @izturn)\r\n- Contour can now include the kind, namespace and name of the relevant HTTPProxy/Ingress/HTTPRoute in Envoy's access logs. See the [access logging docs](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.26/config/access-logging/#logging-the-route-source) for more information. (#5534, @skriss)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.27.0. See the [release notes here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.27.0/version_history/v1.27/v1.27.0). (#5594, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: Expose all Envoy service IPs and Hostname in `Gateway.Status.Addresses`. Only the first IP was exposed before, even for dual-stack service. (#5651, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n- Updates to Go 1.20.7. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20) for more information. (#5663, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Add included HTTPProxy namespace and name to status condition error message when a root HTTPProxy includes another root. (#5670, @HeavenTonight)\r\n- Gateway provisioner: add a base-id to the Envoy daemonset/deployment to solve the (potential) shared memory regions conflict (#5677, @izturn)\r\n- Updates to Kubernetes 1.28. Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.26, 1.27 and 1.28. (#5700, @skriss)\r\n- Updates external auth examples and manifests to use the new contour-authserver registry and version, `ghcr.io/projectcontour/contour-authserver:v4`. (#5725, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Update FIPS build documentation for changes to Envoy 1.26. Updates guide versions for 1.25 and main. (#5415, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Collapses the documentation for 1.21 and 1.20 into a single set per minor version, and removes older docs from the website dropdown. (#5432, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.26.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.26 through 1.28.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

now, up until 0.15.0). In the `ids` field, multiple IDs\n  can now be specified in a grant, either via commas (text format) or array\n  (JSON format). ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3263)).\n* dev environment: When running `boundary dev` the initial LDAP auth-method with an\n  ID of `amldap_1234567890` is now in a public-active state, so it will be returned\n  in the response from `boundary auth-methods list`\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Grants can now accept more than one ID per grant string (or entry in JSON) via\n  the `ids` parameter. In 0.15.0 the ability to add new grants via the `id`\n  parameter will be removed.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* PKI worker authentication: A worker authentication record can be stored more than once, if it matches the \n  existing record for that worker auth key ID. Fixes an edge case where a worker attempted authorization\n  and the controller successfully stored the worker auth record but went down before returning authorization\n  details to the worker.

However, this was not done when\na view reference was replaced with a new field. This made the field\nreferenced to be deleted when it was wrongly concluded that the field is\nunused. Problem arises because the same underlying field is referenced by\nall the view references created for that field.\n\nFor a query like this one:\nWITH  cte AS (SELECT\n              (SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1),\n               COUNT(dt.f2),\n               dt.f3\n              FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS dt)\nSELECT * FROM cte;\n\nit gets transformed into\n\nselect `derived_2_6`.`COUNT(f1)` AS `(SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`COUNT(dt.f2)` AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`Name_exp_1` AS `f3`\nfrom (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f2`) AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n            `test`.`t1`.`f3` AS `Name_exp_1`\n      from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_5`\nleft join (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f1`) AS `COUNT(f1)`\n           from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_6` on(true) where true;\n\nThe expression \"Name_exp_1\" is a view reference because the derived\ntable \"dt\" gets merged. When this is replaced with an \"Item_field\"\nduring subquery to derived transformation, we do not increment the\nreference count. Later, we see that the derived table \"cte\" which\nis resolved after the creation of the derived tables \"derived_2_5\"\nand \"derived_2_6\" gets merged.

tool.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Distributed Deployment Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide).\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade from v2.0.1 to v2.1.0\r\n* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/master/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB\r\n* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:\r\n  * apollo-configservice\r\n  * apollo-adminservice\r\n  * apollo-portal\r\n* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204\r\n```sql\r\nuse ApolloPortalDB;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION`;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @shenhuaxin made their first contribution in https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/4409\r\n* @lorgine-li made their first
