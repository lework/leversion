The updates also includes a 30 minute maximum timeout for file downloading, which can be an issue for very large or slow downloads if they exceed more than 30 minutes to complete.\r\n\r\n### SECURITY:\r\n* Bump packer-plugin-sdk to v0.3.0 to address reported vulnerabilities within\r\n    the go-getter library.\r\n    [GH-11843](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11843)\r\n* Bump plugins relying on go-getter for downloading remote files to address\r\n    reported vulnerabilities within the go-getter library.

Until then, when navigating to Explore using the deprecated format the URLs are automatically converted. If you have existing links pointing to Explore update them using the format generated by Explore upon navigation.\n\nYou can identify a compact URL by its format. Compact URLs have the left (and optionally right) url parameter as an array of strings, for example `&left=[\"now-1h\",\"now\"...]`.

Currently, the `static` credential store can hold\n  credentials of type `username_password`. These credentials can act as\n  credential sources for targets, similar to credential libraries from the\n  `vault` credential store, and thus can be brokered to users at session\n  authorization time. [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2174)\n* `boundary connect` Credential Brokering Integration: we have extended integration\n  into the `boundary connect` helpers. A new `sshpass` style has been added to the \n  `ssh` helper, when used, if the credential contains a username/password and `sshpass` \n  is installed, the command will automatically pass the credentials to the `ssh` process.\n  Additionally, the default `ssh` helper will now use the `username` of the brokered credential.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2191).\n* controller: Improve response time for listing sessions.\n  This also creates a new periodic job that will delete terminated\n  sessions after 1 hour.\n  See Deprecations/Changes for some additional details.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2160).\n* event filtering: Change event filters to use lowercase and snake case for data\n  elements like the rest of Boundary filters do. \n* ui: Use include_terminated flag for listing sessions.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1126).\n* ui: Add Quick Setup onboarding guide.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1140).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* The plugin execution_dir configuration parameter is now respected.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2183).\n* ui: Fix Users page not updating fields correctly.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1105).\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Targets: Removes support for `credential libraries` with respect to Target resources. \n  The `library` `fields` and `actions` were deprecated in [Boundary 0.5.0](#050-20210802), \n  please use `credential sources` instead. See changelog referenced above for \n  more details ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1533)).\n* Credential Libraries: The `user_password` credential type has been renamed to\n  `username_password` to remove any inconsistency over what the credential type is.\n  All existing `user_password` typed credential libraries will be migrated to\n  `username_password` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2154)).\n* controller: Change the default behavior of the session list endpoint\n  to no longer include sessions in a terminated state and introduces\n  a new query parameter/cli flag to include the terminated sessions.\n  This also removes the connection information from the list response.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2160).\n* Anonymous user permissions: In order to reduce the risk of accidental and\n  unintended granting of permissions to anonymous users, the permissions system\n  now only allows certain actions on certain resources to be assigned to the\n  anonymous user; currently these are the same permissions as assigned in\n  Boundary's default role permissions. If other use-cases arise this list can be\n  expanded. See [the\n  documentation](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/security/permissions/assignable-permissions)\n  for more details.\n\n", "created_at": "2022-06-20T17:51:01Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.78.0", "tag_name": "v1.78.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.78.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "### Changes\r\n\r\n## [v1.78.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.78.0)\r\n\r\nReleased at 20-06-2022\r\n\r\n**Update notes:** this release introduces backwards-incompatible changes to communication protocol between `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes in cluster version of VictoriaMetrics because of added [query tracing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#query-tracing), so `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes may log communication errors during the upgrade. These errors should stop after all the `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes are updated to new release. It is safe to downgrade to previous releases.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY: add `-flagsAuthKey` command-line flag for protecting `/flags` endpoint from unauthorized access. Though this endpoint already hides values for command-line flags with `key` and `password` substrings in their names, other sensitive information could be exposed there. See [This issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2753).\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: support query tracing, which allows determining bottlenecks during query processing. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#query-tracing) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1403).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add `cardinality` tab, which can help identifying the source of [high cardinality](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-cardinality) and [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate) issues. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2233) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2730) feature requests and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-explorer).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): small UX enhancements according to [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2638).\r\n* FEATURE: allow overriding default limits for in-memory cache `indexdb/tagFilters` via flag `-storage.cacheSizeIndexDBTagFilters`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2663).\r\n* FEATURE: add support of `lowercase` and `uppercase` relabeling actions in the same way as [Prometheus 2.36.0 does](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.36.0). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2664).\r\n* FEATURE: add ability to change the `indexdb` rotation timezone offset via `-retentionTimezoneOffset` command-line flag. Previously it was performed at 4am UTC time. This could lead to performance degradation in the middle of the day when VictoriaMetrics runs in time zones located too far from UTC. Thanks to @cnych for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2574).\r\n* FEATURE: limit the number of background merge threads on systems with big number of CPU cores by default. This increases the max size of parts, which can be created during background merge when `-storageDataPath` directory has limited free disk space. This may improve on-disk data compression efficiency and query performance. The limits can be tuned if needed with `-smallMergeConcurrency` and `-bigMergeConcurrency` command-line flags. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2673).\r\n* FEATURE: accept optional `limit` query arg at [/api/v1/labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names) and [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values) for limiting the numbef of sample entries returned from these endpoints. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements).\r\n* FEATURE: optimize performance for [/api/v1/labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names) and [/api/v1/label/.../values](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values) endpoints when `match[]`, `extra_label` or `extra_filters[]` query args are passed to these endpoints. This should help with [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1533).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): support `limit` param per-group for limiting number of produced samples per each rule. Thanks to @Howie59 for [implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2676).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): remove dependency on Internet access at [web API pages](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#web). Previously the functionality and the layout of these pages was broken without Internet access. See [shis issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2594).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): send alerts to the configured notifiers in parallel. Previously alerts were sent to notifiers sequentially. This could delay sending pending alerts when notifier blocks on the currently sent alert.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): implement the `http://vmagent:8429/service-discovery` page in the same way as Prometheus does. This page shows the original labels for all the discovered targets alongside the resulting labels after the relabeling. This simplifies service discovery debugging.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): remove dependency on Internet access at `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page. Previously the page layout was broken without Internet access. See [shis issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2594).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add support for `kubeconfig_file` option at [kubernetes_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config). It may be useful for Kubernetes monitoring by `vmagent` outside Kubernetes cluster. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1464).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): expose `/api/v1/status/config` endpoint in the same way as Prometheus does. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#config).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `-promscrape.suppressScrapeErrorsDelay` command-line flag, which can be used for delaying and aggregating the logging of per-target scrape errors. This may reduce the amounts of logs when `vmagent` scrapes many unreliable targets. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2575). Thanks to @jelmd for [the initial implementation](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2576).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `-promscrape.cluster.name` command-line flag, which allows proper data de-duplication when the same target is scraped from multiple [vmagent clusters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#scraping-big-number-of-targets). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2679).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `action: graphite` relabeling rules optimized for extracting labels from Graphite-style metric names. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#graphite-relabeling) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2737).\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/products/enterprise/): expose `vm_downsampling_partitions_scheduled` and `vm_downsampling_partitions_scheduled_size_bytes` metrics, which can be used for tracking the progress of initial [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling) for historical data. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2612).\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): do not spend up to 5 seconds when trying to connect to unavailable `vmstorage` nodes. This should improve query latency when some of `vmstorage` nodes aren't available. Expose `vm_tcpdialer_addr_available{addr=\"...\"}` metric at `http://vmselect:8481/metrics` for determining whether the given `addr` is available for establishing new connections. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/711#issuecomment-1160363187).\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): add `-vmstorageDialTimeout` command-line flags to `vmselect` and `vminsert` for tuning the maximum duration for connection estabilishing to `vmstorage` nodes. This should help resolving [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/711).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: support for data ingestion in [DataDog format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent) from legacy clients / agents. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2670). Thanks to @elProxy for the fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not expose `vm_promscrape_service_discovery_duration_seconds_bucket` metric for unused service discovery types. This reduces the number of metrics exported at `http://vmagent:8429/metrics`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2671).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): properly apply `alert_relabel_configs` relabeling rules to `-notifier.config` according to [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#notifier-configuration-file). Thanks to @spectvtor for [the bugfix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2633).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): properly add `Content-Encoding: snappy`, `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf` and `X-Prometheus-Remote-Write-Version: 0.1.0` request headers when `vmalert` sends [evaluated recording rules' data](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#recording-rules) to `-remoteWrite.url`. These headers are needed by some remote storage systems in order to properly decode snappy-encoded request body. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2685) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2701) pull requests. Thanks to @manji-0 for th fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: deny [background merge](https://valyala.medium.com/how-victoriametrics-makes-instant-snapshots-for-multi-terabyte-time-series-data-e1f3fb0e0282) when the storage enters read-only mode, e.g. when free disk space becomes lower than `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes`. Background merge needs additional disk space, so it could result in `no space left on device` errors. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2603).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): properly apply the selected time range when auto-refresh is enabled. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2693).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): properly update the url with vmui state when new query is entered. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2692).\r\n* BUGFIX: [Graphite render API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#graphite-render-api-usage): properly calculate sample timestamps when `moving*()` functions such as [movingAverage()](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.movingAverage) are applied over [summarize()](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.summarize).\r\n* BUGFIX: limit the `end` query arg value to `+2 days` in the future at `/api/v1/*` endpoints, because VictoriaMetrics doesn't allow storing samples with timestamps bigger than +2 days in the future. This should help resolving [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2669).\r\n* BUGFIX: properly register time series in per-day inverted index during the first hour after `indexdb` rotation. Previously this could lead to missing time series during querying if these time series stopped receiving new samples during the first hour after `indexdb` rotation. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2698).\r\n* BUGFIX: do not register new series when `-storage.maxHourlySeries` or `-storage.maxDailySeries` limits were reached. Previously samples for new series weren't added to the database when the [cardinality limit](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-limiter) was reached, but series were still registered in the inverted index (aka `indexdb`). This could lead to unbound `indexdb` growth during [high churn rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/FAQ.html#what-is-high-churn-rate).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-06-20T15:12:34Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.13.1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/e9f633ec720fbd4367d2f694574dec101e22d3b9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.13.1 (#78086)", "created_at": "2022-06-20T13:40:16Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "2.36.2 / 2022-06-20", "tag_name": "v2.36.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.36.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus", "body": "* [BUGFIX] Fix serving of static assets like fonts and favicon. #10888\r\n", "created_at": "2022-06-20T13:06:11Z", "project": "Prometheus", "repo": "prometheus/prometheus", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.37.0 \"Foldex Frost\"", "tag_name": "v0.37.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.37.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 TaskRun Matrices, Indexing of Array Results and many fixes and improvements! \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.37.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.37.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.37.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.37.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.37.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attestation\r\n\r\nThe Rekor UUID for this release is `c0d23d6ad406973f9559f3ba2d1ca01f84147d8ffc5b8445c224f98b9591801d`\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udea8 There is a [temporary issue](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/issues/883) with Rekor, which means the attestation cannot be retrieved from Rekor right now.

([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/2678))\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you are using `go/v2` we highly recommend to upgrade your project to latest `go/v3` plugin (default operator-sdk scaffold). Please be aware that `go/v2` is a plugin which was kept to ensure the backwards compatibility with old Kubebuilder layout produced using its CLI versions < `3.0.0`. ([More info](https://book.kubebuilder.io/plugins/go-v2-plugin.html)) Therefore, we are unable to upgrade this plugin continuously and solve tech-debts as it is very likely that it would soon be deprecated by the Kubebuilder community. Note that projects built with this plugin do not produce CRDs for example using v1 APIs so that cannot work on Kubernetes cluster >= `1.22`). Please, ensure that you follow our migration guide [Migrating from pre-v1.0.0 to latest](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/migration/).

([#13356](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13356)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, under some circumstances, fail to parse container cgroup paths ([#14146](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14146)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with the `--sdnotify=conmon` option could send `MAINPID` twice.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command could fail when run inside an LXC container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the pause image of a Pod with a custom ID mappings could not be built ([BZ 2083997](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083997)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where, on `podman machine` VMs on Windows, containers could be prematurely terminated with API forwarding was not running ([#13965](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13965)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where removing a container with a zombie exec session would fail the first time, but succeed for subsequent calls ([#14252](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14252)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a dangling ID in the database could render Podman unusable.\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers with memory limits could not be created when Podman was run in a root cgroup ([#14236](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14236)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--security-opt` option to `podman run` and `podman create` did not support the `no-new-privileges:true` and `no-new-privileges:false` options (the only supported separator was `=`, not `:`) ([#14133](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14133)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers that did not create a network namespace (e.g. containers created with `--network none` or `--network ns:/path/to/ns`) could not be restored from checkpoints ([#14389](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14389)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman-restart.service` could, if enabled, cause system shutdown to hang for 90 seconds ([#14434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14434)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would, when run as root on a container that had the `podman network disconnect` command run on it or that set a custom network interface name, return an error ([#13824](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13824)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman pod create` command would error when the `--uidmap` option was used ([#14233](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14233)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where cleaning up systemd units and timers related to healthchecks was subject to race conditions and could fail.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the default network mode of containers created by the remote Podman client was assigned by the client, not the server ([#14368](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14368)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers joining a pod that was created with `--network=host` would receive a private network namespace ([#13763](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13763)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine rm --force` would remove files related to the VM before stopping it, causing issues if removal was interrupted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman logs` would omit the last line of a container's logs if the log did not end in a newline ([#14458](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14458)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where network cleanup was nonfunctional for containers which used a custom user namespace and were initialized via API ([#14465](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14465)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some options (including volumes) for containers that joined pods were overwritten by the infra container ([#14454](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14454)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--file-locks` option to `podman container restore` was ignored, such that file locks checkpointed by `podman container checkpoint --file-locks` were not restored.\r\n- Fixed a bug where signals sent to a Podman attach session with `--sig-proxy` enabled at the exact moment the container that was attached to exited could cause error messages to be printed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where running the `podman machine start` command more than once (simultaneously) on the same machine would cause errors.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command could not be run on containers that were not running (it now reports all-0s statistics for Docker compatibility) ([#14498](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14498)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where images pulled from a private registry could not be accessed via shortname using the Compat API endpoints ([#14291](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14291)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Delete API for Images would return an incorrect status code (500) when attempting to delete images that are in use ([#14208](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14208)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build API for Images would include the build's `STDERR` output even if the `quiet` parameter was true.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Play Kube API would overwrite any log driver specified by query parameter with the system default.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command now creates an event when it is run.\r\n- Error messages printed when Podman's temporary files directory is not writable have been improved.\r\n- Units for memory limits accepted by Podman commands were incorrectly stated by documentation as megabytes, instead of mebibytes; this has now been corrected ([#14187](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14187)).\r\n",

This allows an admin to specify which cgroup the monitor for exec sync requests runs in (defaults to that of CRI-O). ([#5837](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5837), [@donpenney](https://github.com/donpenney))\r\n - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information.

For more information, see [CVE-2022-21951](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-vrph-m5jj-c46c).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [security advisories page](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Rancher now successfully provisions all downstream cluster types with private registries with the RKE template as expected. See [#37515](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37515).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which a new log was introduced under error level rather than debug level. Note that if conditions occur that result in these log messages, no user intervention is necessary. The buffer will simply be paused from taking any input until it is no longer full. See [#36584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36584).\r\n- After the YAML is directly modified in RKE clusters, support for multiple private registries now functions as expected. See [#37732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/37732).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/requirements/).\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** \r\n  - We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/).\r\n- **Helm version:** \r\n  - Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air-gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** \r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) for information on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and works as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n- **RKE requirements:** \r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)`, please note that Edit and Save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit, and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).  \r\n- **EKS requirements:** \r\n  - There was a setting for Rancher versions prior to 2.5.8 that allowed users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: eks-refresh-cron. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: eks-refresh. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **Fleet-agent:** \r\n  - When upgrading `<=v2.5.7` to `>=v2.5.8`, you may notice that in Apps & Marketplace, there is a fleet-agent release stuck at uninstalling. This is caused by migrating fleet-agent release name. It is safe to delete fleet-agent release as it is no longer used, and doing so should not delete the real fleet-agent deployment since it has been migrated. See [#362](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/362).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Upgrades and Rollbacks:** \r\n  - Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback. Please note the version you would like to upgrade or roll back to change the Rancher version.\r\n  - Please be aware when upgrading to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n  - Existing GKE clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. Refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/#rolling-back-to-rancher-v2-5-0) for the new instructions.\r\n- **Important**: \r\n  - When rolling back, we are expecting you to roll back to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post-upgrade would not be reflected.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off:** \r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. Access to the local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to **true** from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see the documentation.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.5.14\r\n- rancher/rancher-agent:v2.5.14\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.11](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.11)\r\n- RKE - [v1.2.20](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.2.20)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- 1.20.15 (Default)\r\n- 1.19.16\r\n- 1.18.20\r\n- 1.17.17\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Provision Kubernetes v1.16 Clusters** | We have ended support for Kubernetes v1.16. Cluster Manager no longer provisions new v1.16 clusters. If you already have a v1.16 cluster, it is unaffected. |\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced as part of Rancher v2.5.4 through v2.5.10 as an experimental feature but is now deprecated. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only one version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed a feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall it in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General:**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm 3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI.\r\n- **UI Shell:**\r\n  - After closing the shell in the Rancher UI, be aware that the corresponding processes remain running indefinitely for each shell in the pod. See [#16192](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16192).\r\n- **Continuous Delivery:**\r\n  - Restricted admins are not able to create git repos from the Continuous Delivery option under Cluster Explorer; the screen will become stuck in a loading status. See [#4909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4909).\r\n- **Rancher Backup:**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location; it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Monitoring:**\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs. See [#29171](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29171).\r\n- **Istio:**\r\n  - Be aware that when upgrading from Istio v1.7.4 or earlier to any later version, there may be connectivity issues. See [upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#connectivity-issues-among-your-proxies-when-updating-from-1-7-x-where-x-5) and [#31811](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31811).\r\n  - Starting in v1.8.x, [DNS is supported natively](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#istio-coredns-plugin-deprecation). This means that the additional addon component `istioCoreDNS` is deprecated in v1.8.x and is not supported in v1.9x. If you are upgrading from v1.8.x to v1.9.x and you are using the `istioCoreDNS` addon, it is recommended that you disable it and switch to the natively supported DNS prior to upgrade. If you upgrade without disabling it, you will need to manually clean up your installation as it will not get removed automatically. See [#31761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31761) and [#31265](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31265).\r\n  - Istio v1.10 and earlier versions are now End-of-life but are required for the upgrade path in order to not skip a minor version. See [#33824](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33824).\r\n\r\n### Cluster Manager Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n- **GKE:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - When creating GKE clusters in Terraform, the `labels` field cannot be empty: at least one label must be set. See [#32553](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32553).\r\n- **EKS & GKE:**\r\n  - When creating EKS and GKE clusters in Terraform, string fields cannot be set to empty. See [#32440](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32440).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).    \r\n    - After migrating from the in-tree vSphere cloud provider to the out-of-tree cloud provider, attempts to upgrade the cluster will not complete. This is due to nodes containing workloads with bound volumes before the migration failing to drain. Users will observe these nodes stuck in a `draining` state. Follow this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102#issuecomment-943493870) to continue with the upgrade. See [#35102](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#35940](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35940) for more information.  \r\n- **Cluster Tools**\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** \r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster. \r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n    - Monitoring V2 fails to scrape ingress-nginx pods on any nodes except for the one Prometheus is deployed on, if the security group used by worker nodes blocks incoming requests to port 10254. The workaround for this issue is to open up port 10254 on all hosts. See [#32563](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32563).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Logging (Cluster Explorer): Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing Helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio v1.5.\r\n    - [Istio v1.10 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.10-eol-final/) on January 7th, 2022. \r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - In air-gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air-gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n  - **Installation requirements:**\r\n    - Importing a Kubernetes v1.21 cluster might not work properly and is unsupported.\r\n  - **Backup and Restore:**\r\n    - Reinstalling Rancher 2.5.x on the same cluster may fail due to a lingering `rancher.cattle.io.` MutatingWebhookConfiguration object from a previous installation. Manually deleting it will resolve the issue.  \r\n  - **Docker installs:** \r\n    - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. \r\n    - Users may receive an error message when logging in for the first time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).\r\n    - Users may be redirected to the login screen before a password and default view have been set.

Release notes for kOps 1.23 series\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n* If the Kubernetes version is 1.23 or later and the external AWS Cloud Controller Manager is\r\nbeing used, then Kubernetes Node resources will be named after their AWS instance ID instead of their domain name and\r\nmanaged subnets will be configured to launch instances with Resource Based Names.\r\n\r\n* Support for [ShutdownGracePeriod and ShutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/21/graceful-node-shutdown-beta/). By default, kOps will set ShutdownGracePeriod to 30 seconds and ShutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods to 10 seconds if the Kubernetes version is above 1.21.\r\n\r\n* By enabling the [pod identity webhook](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#pod-identity-webhook), you no longer need to modify your Pod specs to assume IAM roles.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Weave CNI is not supported for Kubernetes 1.23 or later.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 has been removed (replaced by Rocky Linux 8).\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now has `disable-cnp-status-updates: true` by default. Set this to false if you rely on the CiliumNetworkPolicy status fields.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.19 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.25.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* The `kops create cluster` command has a new `--discovery-store` flag for specifying a public store for the OIDC-compatible discovery documents.\r\nIf this flag is used in AWS, it will enable IRSA.\r\n\r\n* If `externalDns.provider` is `external-dns`, then `externalDns.watchIngress` will now default to `true`.\r\n\r\n* This release introduces a `v1alpha3` API version. This API version is a work in progress and is likely to be replaced in kOps 1.24.\r\nIt is recommended to keep using the `v1alpha2` API version.\r\n\r\n* IPv6 pod subnets is in a working state using public IPv6 addresses for the Pod network. This works with both Cilium and Calico. IPv6 is still behind a feature flag until service controllers and addons implement support for IPv6. See [the IPv6 documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/networking/ipv6/).\r\n\r\n* The `kops rolling-update cluster` command has a new `--drain-timeout` flag for specifying the maximum amount of time to wait when attempting to drain a node. Previously, rolling-updates would attempt to drain a node for an indefinite amount of time. If `--drain-timeout` is not specified, a default of 15 minutes is applied.\r\n\r\n* Fix inconsistent output of `kops get clusters -ojson`. This will now always return a list (irrespective of a single or multiple clusters) to keep the format consistent. However, note that `kops get cluster dev.example.com -ojson` will continue to work as previously, and will return a single object.\r\n\r\n* Digital Ocean kops now has vpc support. You can specify a `network-cidr` range while creating the kops cluster. kops resources will be created in the new vpc range. Also supports shared vpc; you can specify the vpc uuid while creating kops cluster.\r\n\r\n## 1.23.1 to 1.23.2\r\n\r\n* Use expected pointer type in type assertion when iterating over GS ACLs [@tesspib](https://github.com/tesspib) [#13534](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13534)\r\n* Allow cluster autoscaler to read EC2 instance types to build catalog dynamically [@seh](https://github.com/seh) [#13532](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13532)\r\n* Update Go to v1.17.9 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13551](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13551)\r\n* Add back support for Ubuntu 18.04 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13557](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13557)\r\n* Update Canal's Flannel to v0.15.1 [@tesspib](https://github.com/tesspib) [#13562](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13562)\r\n* Include sysctls in toolbox dump [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13570](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13570)\r\n* Add support for Rocky Linux 8 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13559](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13559)\r\n* Fix OIDC Provider cleanup [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13571](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13571)\r\n* Update containerd to v1.6.3 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13578](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13578)\r\n* Re-add net.bridge settings for flannel [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13564](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13564)\r\n* Revert containerd v1.6.3 upgrade [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#13582](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13582)\r\n* Fix unexpected type for object metadata when using gossip DNS [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13592](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13592)\r\n* Update containerd to v1.6.4 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13596](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13596)\r\n* Update etcd-manager to v3.0.20220503 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#13598](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13598)\r\n* Add hashes for containerd and Docker in order to fix CVE-2022-23648 [@drequena](https://github.com/drequena) [#13606](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13606)\r\n* Avoid \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file loopback for Flatcar Container Linux distribution [@seh](https://github.com/seh) [#13617](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/13617)\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-11T06:55:14Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.4.1", "tag_name": "v1.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases/tag/v1.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/grafana/tempo", "body": "# Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* [BUGFIX] metrics-generator: don't inject X-Scope-OrgID header for single-tenant setups [1417](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1417) (@kvrhdn)\r\n* [BUGFIX] compactor: populate `compaction_objects_combined_total` and `tempo_discarded_spans_total{reason=\"trace_too_large_to_compact\"}` metrics again [1420](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1420) (@mdisibio)\r\n* [BUGFIX] distributor: prevent panics when concurrently calling `shutdown` to forwarder's queueManager [1422](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1422) (@mapno)\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-05T16:52:59Z", "project": "Tempo", "repo": "grafana/tempo", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.26.0", "tag_name": "v0.26.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.26.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n### Fixed\r\n- [#5281](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5281) Blocks: Use correct separators for filesystem paths and object storage paths respectively.\r\n- [#5300](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5300) Query: Ignore cache on queries with deduplication off.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#5220](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5220) Query Frontend: Add `--query-frontend.forward-header` flag, forward headers to downstream querier.\r\n- [#5250](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5250/files) Querier: Expose Query and QueryRange APIs through GRPC.\r\n- [#5290](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5290) Add support for [ppc64le](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#4838](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4838) Tracing: Chanced client for Stackdriver which deprecated \"type: STACKDRIVER\" in tracing YAML configuration.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners.
