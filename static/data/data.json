This is a Community and Prime version release that introduces new features, enhancements, and various updates. To learn more about Rancher Prime, see our page on the [Rancher Prime Platform](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher-platform).\r\n\r\n## Security Fixes for Rancher Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following Rancher security issues:\r\n\r\n- Several enhancements have been made to the cluster and node driver registration process to prevent the possibility of remote code execution (RCE) through untrusted third-party cluster and node drivers. For more information, see [CVE-2024-22036](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc).\r\n- Improvements have been made to binaries and configuration files that are known to be executed by administrative accounts to prevent the possibility of privilege escalation. The binaries and configuration files now have stricter ACLs so that only Administrators can amend the files. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32197](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-7h8m-pvw3-5gh4).\r\n- To avoid credentials being stored in plain-text within the vSphere add-on config when creating a vSphere Rancher HA setup, the `provisioningprebootstrap` feature was added. For more information, see [CVE-2022-45157](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-xj7w-r753-vj8v).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) or in Rancher's [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories) repo.\r\n\r\n## Rancher UI\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n<!-- Add Summary -->\r\n- The performance of the Clusters list on the **Home** page and the Side Menu has greatly improved when there are hundreds of clusters. See [#11999](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11999) and [#12009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12009).\r\n\r\n## Harvester\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- On the Cloud Credential list, you can now easily see if a Harvester Credential is about to expire or has expired and choose to renew it. You will also be notified on the Cluster Management Clusters list when an associated Harvester Cloud Credential is about to expire or has expired. When upgrading, an existing expired Harvester Credential will not contain a warning. You can still renew the token on the resources menu. See [#11270](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11270).\r\n\r\n## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue where multiple, stale secrets may be erroneously created for users on downstream clusters. See [#46894](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46894).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or k3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.9.3\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.9.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.9.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.6.3](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.6.3)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.30.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.9\r\n- v1.28.14\r\n- v1.27.16\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.30.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.9\r\n- v1.28.14\r\n- v1.27.16\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.25 and v1.26 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.9.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#45882](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45882).\r\n  - The `external-rules` [feature flag](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/feature-flags) functionality is removed in Rancher v2.9.0 as the behavior is enabled by default. The feature flag is [still present](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46272) when upgrading from v2.8.5; however, enabling or disabling the feature won't have any effect. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32196](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-64jq-m7rq-768h) and [#45863](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45863).\r\n  - Rancher now validates the Container Default Resource Limit on Projects. Validation mimics the upstream behavior of the Kubernetes API server when it validates LimitRanges. The container default resource configuration must have properly formatted quantities for all requests and limits. Limits for any resource must not be less than requests. See [#39700](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39700).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - The controller now cleans up instances of `ClusterUserAttribute` that have no corresponding `UserAttribute`. See [#44985](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44985).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - When Rancher starts, it now identifies all deprecated and unrecognized setting resources and adds a `cattle.io/unknown` label. You can list these settings with the command `kubectl get settings -l 'cattle.io/unknown==true'`. In Rancher v2.9 and later, these settings will be removed instead. See [#43992](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43992).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher Compose is no longer supported, and all parts of it are being removed in the v2.8 release line. See [#43341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43341).\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.23 and v1.24 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.25 or later. See [#42828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42828).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - Docker CLI 20.x is at end-of-life and no longer supported in Rancher. Please update your local Docker CLI versions to 23.0.x or later. Earlier versions may not recognize OCI compliant Rancher image manifests. See [#45424](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45424).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Kontainer Engine v1 (KEv1) provisioning and the respective cluster drivers are now deprecated. KEv1 provided plug-ins for different targets using cluster drivers. The Rancher-maintained cluster drivers for EKS, GKE and AKS have been replaced by the hosted provider drivers, EKS-Operator, GKE-Operator and AKS-Operator. Node drivers are now available for self-managed Kubernetes.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When you provision a downstream cluster, the cluster's name must conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n  - Privilege escalation is disabled by default when creating deployments from the Rancher API. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\n    Please note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\n    RKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from the upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming at the official [SUSE blog](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n  - Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44857](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44857).\r\n  - Weave CNI support for RKE clusters is removed in response to Weave CNI not being supported by upstream Kubernetes v1.30 and later. See [#45954](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45954)\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke1) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#43175](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43175).\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated. Weave will be removed in RKE v1.30. See [#42730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42730).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE2 clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44856](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44856).\r\n  - Added a new annotation, `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop`. When set to `true`, it drops the `dynamicSchemaSpec` field from machine pool definitions. This prevents cluster nodes from re-provisioning unintentionally when the cluster object is updated from an external source such as Terraform or Fleet. See [#44618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44618).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE2 clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke2) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#42749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42749).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster API <!-- highlander -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The `cluster-api` core provider controllers run in a pod in the `cattle-provisioning-cattle-system` namespace, within the local cluster. These controllers are installed with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/rancher/provisioning). Previously, Rancher ran `cluster-api` controllers in an embedded fashion. This change makes it easier to maintain `cluster-api` versioning. See [#41094](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41094).\r\n  - The token hashing algorithm generates new tokens using SHA3. Existing tokens that don't use SHA3 won't be re-hashed. This change affects ClusterAuthTokens (the downstream synced version of tokens for ACE) and Tokens (only when token hashing is enabled). SHA3 tokens should work with ACE and Token Hashing. Tokens that don't use SHA3 may not work when ACE and token hashing are used in combination. If, after upgrading to Rancher v2.7.7, you experience issues with ACE while token hashing is enabled, re-generate any applicable tokens. See [#42062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/42062).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The built-in `restricted-admin` role is being deprecated in favor of a more flexible global role configuration, which is now available for different use cases other than only the `restricted-admin`. If you want to replicate the permissions given through this role, use the new `inheritedClusterRoles` feature to create a custom global role. A custom global role, like the `restricted-admin` role, grants permissions on all downstream clusters. See [#42462](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42462). Given its deprecation, the `restricted-admin` role will continue to be included in future builds of Rancher through the v2.8.x and v2.9.x release lines. However, in accordance with the CVSS standard, only security issues scored as critical will be backported and fixed in the `restricted-admin` role until it is completely removed from Rancher. <!-- Security 1249 -->\r\n  - Reverse DNS server functionality has been removed. The associated [`rancher/rdns-server`](https://github.com/rancher/rdns-server) repository is now archived. Reverse DNS is already disabled by default. <!--Rancher security 1201 -->\r\n  - The Rancher CLI configuration file `~/.rancher/cli2.json` previously had permissions set to `0644`. Although `0644` would usually indicate that all users have read access to the file, the parent directory would block users' access. New Rancher CLI configuration files will only be readable by the owner (`0600`). Invoking the CLI will trigger a warning, in case old configuration files are world-readable or group-readable. See [#42838](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42838).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Helm Chart) <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app in a RKE2/K3s cluster, if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows. Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters.<!-- no issue number --><!-- introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Continuous Delivery\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Rancher now supports **monitoring of continuous delivery**.  Starting with version `v104.0.1` of the Fleet (`v0.10.1` of Fleet) and `rancher-monitoring` chart, continuous delivery provides metrics about the state of its resources and the `rancher-monitoring` chart contains dashboards to visualize those metrics. Installing the `rancher-monitoring` chart to the local/upstream cluster automatically configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from the continuous delivery controllers and installs Grafana dashboards. These dashboards are accessible via Grafana but are not yet integrated into the Rancher UI. You can open Grafana from the Rancher UI by navigating to the *Cluster > Monitoring > Grafana* view. See [rancher/fleet#1408](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1408) for implementation details.\r\n  - Continuous delivery in Rancher also introduces  **sharding with node selectors**. See [rancher/fleet#1740](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1740) for implementation details and the [Fleet documentation](https://fleet.rancher.io/installation#multi-controller-install-sharding) for instructions on how to use it.\r\n  - We have **reduced image size and complexity** by integrating the former external gitjob repository and by merging various controller codes. This also means that the gitjob container image (`rancher/gitjob`) is not needed anymore, as the required functionality is embedded into the `rancher/fleet` container image. The gitjob deployment will still be created but pointing to the `rancher/fleet` container image instead. Please also note that a complete [list of necessary container images](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/download/v2.9.0/rancher-images.txt) for air-gapped deployments is released alongside Rancher releases. You can find this list as `rancher-images.txt` in the assets of the [release on Github](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/v2.9.0/). See [rancher/fleet#2342](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/2342) for more details.\r\n  - Continuous delivery also adds **experimental OCI content storage**. See [rancher/fleet#2561](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2561) for implementation details and [rancher/fleet-docs#179](https://github.com/rancher/fleet-docs/pull/179/files) for documentation.\r\n  - Continuous delivery now splits components into containers and has switched to the controller-runtime framework. The rewritten controllers switch to **structured logging**.\r\n  - Leader election can now be configured (see [rancher/fleet#1981](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/1981)), as well as the worker count for the fleet-controller (see [rancher/fleet#2430](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2430)).\r\n  - The release deprecates the \"fleet test\" command in favor of \"target\" and \"deploy\" with a dry-run option (see [rancher/fleet#2102](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2102/files)).\r\n  - Bug fixes enhance drift detection, cluster status reporting, and various operational aspects.\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Rancher uses additional trusted CAs when establishing a secure connection to the keycloak OIDC authentication provider. See [#43217](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43217).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting has been replaced by the setting, `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, and is no longer available in the UI. See [#38535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38535).\r\n  - [API tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens) now have default time periods after which they expire. Authentication tokens expire after 90 days, while kubeconfig tokens expire after 30 days. See [#41919](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41919).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - The embedded Cluster API webhook is removed from the Rancher webhook and can no longer be installed from the webhook chart. It has not been used as of Rancher v2.7.7, where it was migrated to a separate Pod. See [#44619](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44619).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher's webhook now honors the `bind` and `escalate` verbs for GlobalRoles. Users who have `*` set on GlobalRoles will now have both of these verbs, and could potentially use them to escalate privileges in Rancher v2.8.0 and later. You should review current custom GlobalRoles, especially cases where `bind`, `escalate`, or `*` are granted, before you upgrade.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - Rancher installs the same pinned version of the `rancher-webhook` chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n  - The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Legacy code for the following v1 charts is no longer available in the [`rancher/system-charts`](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts) repository:\r\n\r\n    - `rancher-cis-benchmark`\r\n    - `rancher-gatekeeper-operator`\r\n    - `rancher-istio`\r\n    - `rancher-logging`\r\n    - `rancher-monitoring`\r\n\r\n    The code for these charts will remain available for previous versions of Rancher.\r\n  - Helm v2 support is deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line and will be removed in Rancher v2.9.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type `Application`. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some necessary actions within Azure AD, causing errors.<!-- no issue number --><!--introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n  - The multi-cluster app legacy feature is no longer available. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - OPA Gatekeeper\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - OPA Gatekeeper is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As a replacement for OPA Gatekeeper, consider [switching to Kubewarden](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/comparisons/opa-comparison). See [#42627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42627).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - A configurable `priorityClass` is available in the Rancher pod and its feature charts. Previously, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - If you use a version of backup-restore older than v102.0.2+up3.1.2 to take a backup of Rancher v2.7.7, the migration will encounter a `capi-webhook` error. Make sure that the chart version used for backups is v102.0.2+up3.1.2, which has `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources removed from the resourceSet. If you can't use v102.0.2+up3.1.2 for backups, delete all `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources from the backup tar before using it. See [#382](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/pull/382).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging. Previously, the default image was Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n    - Rancher aggregates the changed counts and only sends a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n    - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, with a significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s respects the `managedBy` annotation. In its initial release, Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false`, since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Security\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When `agent-tls-mode` is set to `strict`, users must provide the certificate authority to Rancher or downstream clusters will disconnect from Rancher, and require manual intervention to fix. This applies to several setup types, including:\r\n    - Let's Encrypt - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n    - Bring Your Own Cert - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used to generate the cert and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n    - Proxy/External - when the setting is `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used by the proxy and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n\r\n    See [#45628](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45628) and [#45655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45655).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer supported for Rancher app ingresses. See [#42027](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42027).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Extensions\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - UI extension owners must update and publish a new version of their extensions to be compatible with Rancher v2.9.0 and later. For more information see the [Rancher v2.9 extension support page](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/rancher-2.9-support).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - The Rancher dashboard fails to load an extension that utilizes backported Vue 3 features, displaying an error in the console `object(...) is not a function`. New extensions that utilize the `defineComponent` will not be backwards compatible with older versions of the dashboard. Existing extensions should continue to work moving forward. See [#10568](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10568).  \r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - After upgrading to v2.9.0, Rancher's pods may crash and fail to become available. This primarily affects clusters which have been upgraded from older Kubernetes versions, and can also result in disconnected downstream clusters. As a workaround, all CRDs in each affected cluster need to be updated to add a `version.Schema.openAPIV3Schema`. See [#46213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46213).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. This is a benign error that occurs as part of the upgrade process, and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type `ClusterIP` to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port won't be created upon your first attempt to save the new port. You must repeat the procedure to add the port again. The Service Type field will display `Do not create a service` during the second procedure. Change this to `ClusterIP` and save to create the new port. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Currently there are known issues with the [data directory feature](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45038) which are outlined below:\r\n    - K3s does not support the data directory feature. See [#10589](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/10589).\r\n    - Currently selecting `Use the same path for System-agent, Provisioning and K8s Distro data directories configuration` results in Rancher using the same data directory for system agent, provisioning, and distribution components as opposed to appending the specified component names to the root directory. To mitigate this issue, you will need to configure the 3 paths separately and they must follow the guidelines below:\r\n          - Absolute paths (start with /)\r\n          - Clean (not contain env vars, shell expressions, ., or ..)\r\n          - Not set to the same thing\r\n          - Not nested one within another\r\n      See [#11566](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11566).\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11435](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11435).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.4:**\r\n  - RKE2 clusters with invalid values for tolerations or affinity agent customizations don't display an error message, and remain in an `Updating` state. This causes cluster creation to hang. See [#41606](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41606).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.9:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - When provisioning clusters with an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners doesn't take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. As a workaround, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128).<!-- first appears in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.3 as https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689 which redirects to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Amazon ECR Private Registries don't work from RKE2/K3s. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021)..<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2**:\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n  - Node drivers that rely on machine configs that contain fields of the type `array string` render a form requesting a single string instead. See [#11936](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11936).\r\n  - Some node drivers incorrectly stipulate that no credentials are required, resulting in the UI skipping the requirement to supply credentials when provisioning a cluster of that type. See [#11974](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11974).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7**:\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2**:\r\n  - When creating a GKE cluster in the Rancher UI you will see provisioning failures as the `clusterIpv4CidrBlock` and `clusterSecondaryRangeName` fields conflict. See [#8749](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8749).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Rancher CLI currently lists the Azure authentication provider options out of order. See [#46128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46128).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Docker Install <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Single node Rancher won't start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or later. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798) and [#40257](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40257).\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.0:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to longer startup times. When launching Docker for the first time, you'll receive an error message stating, \"Cannot read property `endsWith` of undefined\", as described in [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).  You'll then be directed to a login screen. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Windows <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Issues - Windows Nodes in RKE2 Clusters\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - AKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658#issuecomment-733035658) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.x:**\r\n  - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).<!-- no mention of patch version in issue thread, milestone is simply v2.6, already appear as a longstanding issue in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.0 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - When editing or upgrading an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).<!-- first proposed as a release note for https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561#issuecomment-879272354 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - GKE\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to Kubernetes v1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.1**\r\n  - Temporarily reducing privileges by impersonating an account with lower privileges is currently not supported. See [#41988](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41988) and [#46790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46790).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - The deployment's `securityContext` section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy (PSP) support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).<!-- https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815#issuecomment-1074184973 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The SAML authentication pop-up throws a `404` error on high-availability RKE installations. Single node Docker installations aren't affected. If you refresh the browser window and select **Resend**, the authentication request will succeed, and you will be able to log in. See [#31163](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31163).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.2:**\r\n  - Users on certain LDAP setups don't have permission to search LDAP. When they attempt to perform a search, they receive the error message, `Result Code 32 \"No Such Object\"`. See [#35259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35259).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Encryption\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.4:**\r\n  - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - In the Rancher UI when navigating between Harvester clusters of different versions a refresh may be required to view version specific functionality. See [#11559](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11559).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - When provisioning a Harvester RKE1 cluster in Rancher, the **vGPU** field is not displayed under **Cluster Management > Advanced Settings**, this is not a supported feature. However, the **vGPU** field is available when provisioning a Harvester RKE2 cluster. See [#10909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10909).\r\n  - When provisioning a multi-node Harvester RKE2 cluster in Rancher, you need to allocate one vGPU more than the number of nodes you have or provisioning will fail. See [#11009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11009) and v2.9.0 back-port issue [#10989](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10989).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery <!-- fleet --> <!-- use function based naming from https://jira.suse.com/browse/SURE-6864? e.g. \"Continuous Deployment with Fleet?\" -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Target customization can produce custom resources that exceed the Rancher API's maximum bundle size. This results in `Request entity too large` errors when attempting to add a GitHub repo. Only target customizations that modify the Helm chart URL or version are affected. As a workaround, use multiple paths or GitHub repos instead of target customization. See [#1650](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1650).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment, rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancherlabs/release-notes/pull/139-->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.5:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - CIS Scan <!-- neo/security -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Some CIS checks related to file permissions fail on RKE and RKE2 clusters with CIS v1.7 and CIS v1.8 profiles. See [#42971](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42971).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail. The backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion `v1beta1`. There are two workarounds for this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Istio <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- Istio v1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes v1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes v1.23 until the next charts' release.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Read-only project permissions and the View Monitoring role aren't sufficient to view links on the Monitoring index page. Users won't be able to see monitoring links. As a workaround, you can perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n    1. If you haven't already, install Monitoring on the project.\r\n    1. Move the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace into the project.\r\n    1. Grant project users the View Monitoring (`monitoring-ui-view`) role, and `read-only` or higher permissions on at least one project in the cluster.\r\n\r\n    See [#4466](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4466).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus.

This\ncould allow a user who was unassigned from an Okta group to log into a Teleport\ncluster once with a role granted by the unassigned group being present in their\neffective role set.\n\nNote: This issue only affects Teleport clusters that have installed a SCIM-only\nOkta integration as described in this guide. If you have an Okta integration\nwith user sync enabled or only using Okta SSO auth connector to log into your\nTeleport cluster without SCIM integration configured, you&#39;re unaffected. To\nverify your configuration:\n\n- Use `tctl get plugins/okta --format=json | jq &#34;.[].spec.Settings.okta.sync_settings.sync_users&#34;`\n  command to check if you have Okta integration with user sync enabled. If it\n  outputs null or false, you may be affected and should upgrade.\n- Check SCIM provisioning settings for the Okta application you created or\n  updated while following the SCIM-only setup guide. If SCIM provisioning is\n  enabled, you may be affected and should upgrade.\n\nWe strongly recommend customers who use Okta SCIM integration to upgrade their\nauth servers to version 16.3.0 or later. Teleport services other than auth\n(proxy, SSH, Kubernetes, desktop, application, database and discovery) are not\nimpacted and do not need to be updated.\n\n### Other improvements and fixes\n\n* Added a new teleport_roles_total metric that exposes the number of roles which exist in a cluster. [#47812](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/47812)\n* Teleport&#39;s Windows Desktop Service now filters domain-joined Linux hosts out during LDAP discovery. [#47773](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/47773)\n* The `join_token.create` audit event has been enriched with additional metadata. [#47765](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/47765)\n* Propagate resources configured in teleport-kube-agent chart values to post-install and post-delete hooks. [#47743](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/47743)\n* Add support for the Datadog Incident Management plugin helm chart.

"Pinpoint", "repo": "naver/pinpoint", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.105.0", "tag_name": "v1.105.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.105.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "## [v1.105.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.105.0)\r\n\r\nReleased at 2024-10-21\r\n\r\n**Update note 1: `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limit on `vmselect` can no longer exceed `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limit on `vmstorage`. If you don't set this flag at `vmstorage`, then it will be automatically calculated based on available resources. This can result into rejecting expensive read queries if they exceed auto-calculated limit. The limit can be overriden by manually setting `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` at vmstorage, but for better reliability we recommend sticking to default values. Refer to the CHANGELOG below and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6930).**\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/) and [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/): add support of [exponential histograms](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram) ingested via [OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#sending-data-via-opentelemetry). Such histograms will be automatically converted to [VictoriaMetrics histogram format](https://valyala.medium.com/improving-histogram-usability-for-prometheus-and-grafana-bc7e5df0e350). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6354).\r\n* FEATURE: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) and `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): automatically set `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limit based on available memory and `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`. The more memory is available to the process and the lower is `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`, the higher will be `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` limit. This should protect vmstorage from expensive queries without the need to manually set `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries`. The calculated limit will be printed during process start-up logs and exposed as `vm_search_max_unique_timeseries` metric. Set `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` manually to override auto calculation. Please note, `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` on vmselect can't exceed the same name limit on vmstorage, it can only be set to lower values. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6930).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/), `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): disable stream processing mode for data [ingested via InfluxDB](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf) HTTP endpoints by default. With this change, the data is processed in batches (see `-influx.maxRequestSize`) and user will get parsing errors immediately as they happen. This also improves users' experience and resiliency against thundering herd problems caused by clients without backoff policies like telegraf. To enable stream mode back, pass HTTP header `Stream-Mode: \"1\"` with each request. For data sent via TCP and UDP (see `-influxListenAddr`) protocols streaming processing remains enabled.\r\n* FEATURE: `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): set default value for `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` to `0`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6930).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): allow using HTTP/2 client for Kubernetes service discovery if `-promscrape.kubernetes.useHTTP2Client` cmd-line flag is set. This could help to reduce the amount of opened connections to the Kubernetes API server. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5971) for the details.\r\n* FEATURE: add Darwin binaries for [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/) to the release flow. The binaries will be available in the new release.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): `-rule` cmd-line flag now supports multi-document YAML files. This could be useful when rules are retrieved via HTTP URL where multiple rule files were merged together in one response. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6753). Thanks to @Irene-123 for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6995).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/): allow parsing `scope` claim parsing in array format. This is useful for cases when identity provider does encode claims in array format.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add the ability to cancel running queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7097).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add playgrounds for [retention filters](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/#retention-filters) and [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/#downsampling) configurations. These new pages are available in vmui in the `Tools` section. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6304).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway/): fix possible panic during parsing of a token without `vm_access` claim. This issue was introduced in v1.104.0.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix error messages rendering from overflowing the screen with long messages. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7207).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl/): properly add metrics tags for `opentsdb` migration source. Previously it could have empty values. See [this PR](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/7161).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): reduce the initial health check interval for datasource. This reduces the time spent on evaluating rules by vmalert-tool. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6970).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert-tool](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert-tool/): allow specifying empty labels list `labels: '{}'` in the same way as promtool does. This improves compatibility between these tools.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support `m` unit for `minutes` duration in command-line flag `-streamAggr.dedupInterval`. Previously unit `m` wasn't supported correctly.\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly apply replication factor when storage node groups are used and replication factor is configured via global value such as `-replicationFactor=2`. Previously, global replication factor was ignored for storage node groups. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#vmstorage-groups-at-vmselect) for more information about storage groups configuration.\r\n* BUGFIX: `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): properly process response in [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#multi-level-cluster-setup). Before, vmselect could return no data in multi-level setup. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7270) for details. The issue was introduced in [v1.104.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11040).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert): properly apply configuration changes during hot-reload to rule groups that haven't started yet. Previously, configuration updates to such groups could have resulted into blocking all evaluations within the group, until vmalert restart.\r\n* BUGFIX: [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/)  and [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): properly update `max_scrape_size` param change during [hot-reload](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#configuration-update). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7260).\r\n", "created_at": "2024-10-21T13:22:27Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.0.5", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zabbix/zabbix/commits/9406e67a5ff0f6bff0e2b17342175cb0b6d9c1a3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

Envoy release.\r\n* Removed support for (long deprecated) opentracing.\u00a0\r\n* Added a configuration setting for the maximum size of response headers\r\nin responses.\r\n* Added support for `connection_pool_per_downstream_connection` flag in\r\ntcp connection pool.\r\n* For the strict DNS and logical DNS cluster types, the `dns_jitter`\r\nfield allows spreading out DNS refresh requests\r\n* Added dynamic metadata matcher support `dynamic metadata input` and\r\n`dynamic metadata input matcher`.\r\n* The xff original IP detection method now supports using a list of\r\ntrusted CIDRs when parsing `x-forwarded-for`.\r\n* QUIC server and client support certificate compression, which can in\r\nsome cases reduce the number of round trips required to setup a\r\nconnection.\r\n* Added the ability to monitor CPU utilization in Linux based systems\r\nvia `cpu utilization monitor` in overload manager.\r\n* Added new access log command operators (`%START_TIME_LOCAL%`

It is intended to be used for values that are expensive to compute and can be reused across multiple queries. The cache can be leveraged by built-in functions to store values that otherwise aren't appropriate for the existing inter-query cache; for instance when the entry size isn't an appropriate or primary limiting factor for cache eviction.\r\n\r\nThe default size of the inter-query value cache is unbounded, but can be configured via the `caching.inter_query_builtin_value_cache.max_num_entries` configuration field. OPA will drop random items from the cache if this limit is exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe cache is used by the `regex` and `glob` built-in functions, which previously had individual, non-configurable caches with a max entry size of `100` each.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the cache is only exercised when running OPA in server mode (ie. `opa run -s`). Also this feature is unsupported for WASM.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar, reported by @amirsalarsafaei\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- Future-proofing tests in the `ast`, `topdown`, `rego`

This method provides data restoration in case of missing parts while optimizing storage space:\r\n\r\n - `EC8+1`: Uses 112.5% of space,\r\n - `EC4+1`: Uses 125% of space,\r\n\r\nwhile maintaining the same level of hardware failure protection as standard replication (200%).\r\n\r\n### New Options in Storage Class Definitions\r\n\r\n- **`TRASH` State**: files in the MooseFS TRASH, so the deleted files that are retained for a configurable period of time, can now have custom storage definitions within a storage class.\r\n- **`ARCHIVE` State Configuration**: `ARCHIVE` state is now fully configurable:\r\n - Set file archive times based on last `atime`, `mtime`, or `ctime`.\r\n - Choose between `FAST` archival (ASAP) or `PER CHUNK`  based on `mtime`.\r\n - Exclude files below a certain length from being archived.\r\n - **Logical Expressions in Label Definitions**: Support for comprehensive logical expressions in label definitions is now available, allowing users to create more flexible and precise rules, providing greater control over how storage classes and states are applied to files. This includes the ability to use negations.\r\n - State-Specific Label Overrides: Override label modes (`STD`, `LOOSE`, `STRICT`) for specific states: `CREATE`, `KEEP`, `ARCHIVE`, or `TRASH`.\r\n\r\n### Storage Class Based on File Patterns\r\nUsers can now assign file storage classes dynamically based on custom file name patterns, providing greater flexibility in managing data. For example, files with a `.backup` extension could be assigned to a specific storage class with lower redundancy, while files starting with `important_` might be placed in a high-redundancy class.\r\n\r\n### Broadcast Mechanism for Server Restarts\r\nServer restarts (both chunk server and master) no longer block I/O until the end of chunk registration process.\r\n\r\n### Improved Chunk Format\r\nEnhanced handling of control sums for more secure chunk storage.\r\n\r\n### New Web-based Graphical User Interface with Dark Mode\r\nAdditional monitoring charts and system insights, offering improved chart systems and more detailed information. Moreover, dark mode is now available.\r\n\r\n### Multi-LAN Configuration\r\nSupport for clients across different LANs to remain within their LAN IP class while communicating with the master server. Can be used alongside the `remap` option known from MooseFS 3.x.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced IP Remap\r\nCustomizable IP-to-IP remapping instead of just fixed remapping of leading bits in IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Daemon Info\r\nMooseFS daemons instructed by an `info` signal can now generate detailed info files in working directory, listing configuration, state, and module data for enhanced troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### CS-Master Consistency Checks\r\nNew mechanism to ensure consistency between master and chunk server data held in RAM.\r\n\r\n### New `mfshdd.cfg` Options\r\nFlags with limits and options for disks with chunks shared with other processes, allowing better calculation of available/occupied space on disks.\r\n\r\n### New Offline Tool: `mfsmetasearch`\r\nAllows offline searches for files in metadata based on various conditions such as chunk IDs, inodes, and attributes.\r\n\r\n### Updated Logging System\r\nClear division of log messages by severity levels, with customizable logging options and syslog reporting.\r\n\r\n### New ACL Handling Tools\r\nUseful for operating systems without built-in ACL management tools.\r\n\r\n### General Algorithm Improvements\r\nNumerous improvements to algorithms for faster and more efficient MooseFS performance, especially in edge-case scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Quality of Life Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Faster Metadata Loading** at master server startup.\r\n- **`mfssupervisor` Tool** for on-demand metadata saves.\r\n- **`mfsfileinfo` Tool** can now display chunk paths on chunk servers.\r\n- **Enhanced Chunk Rebalance Algorithms**.\r\n- **More Configuration Options** for various operations and storage management.\r\n\r\n## Community Contributions\r\nDuring the development of this version, we received valuable feedback and suggestions from our community, many of which have been implemented. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to shaping this release of MooseFS!\r\n\r\n\r\n## MooseFS PRO\r\nIf you are looking for high availability (HA) for master servers, improved disk space management with enhanced data protection through EC configurations with higher redundancy levels, and dedicated support, we also offer MooseFS PRO version. This version is designed for enterprise environments where uptime and data integrity are critical, providing features like automatic failover for master servers, more advanced erasure coding for greater resilience against hardware failures, and professional support services to ensure smooth operation and rapid issue resolution. MooseFS PRO adds an extra layer of reliability and optimization for those managing large-scale, mission-critical storage systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe recommend to update your MooseFS clusters to this version.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPiotr / MooseFS Team", "created_at": "2024-09-23T10:07:48Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "RabbitMQ 4.0.2", "tag_name": "v4.0.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "body": "RabbitMQ `4.0.2` is a maintenance release in the `4.0.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).\r\n\r\nStarting June 1st, 2024, community support for this series will only be provided to [regularly contributing users](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) and those\r\nwho hold a valid [commercial support license](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the upgrade section from the [4.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1)\r\nif upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.\r\n\r\nThis release requires Erlang 26 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.2.x`.\r\n[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on\r\nErlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimum Supported Erlang Version\r\n\r\nAs of 4.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 26.

CNI\r\n- **Support for building node images from existing Kubernetes releases**\r\n  - **NOTE**: For Kubernetes releases before v1.31.0, this will result in larger images because kind opted in to compiling out remaining in-tree cloud providers with a build tag when publishing images. For v1.31.0+ there is no difference.\r\n  - See: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#building-images\r\n- Support for loading multiple image archives in `kind load image-archive`\r\n  - **NOTE**: it is still more efficient to do a single archive in most cases\r\n- Migrated to skipPhase in Init/JoinConfiguration instead of the kubeadm flags, making it possible for users to cutomize the phases (at your own risk!) with config patches\r\n- powershell completion\r\n- Updated dependencies, including, but not limited to:\r\n  - containerd 1.7.18\r\n  - runc 1.1.13\r\n  - go 1.22.6\r\n  - CNI plugins to 1.5.1\r\n  - pause 3.10\r\n- Docs and clarification for third party install options including scoop and winget\r\n\r\n\r\nImages pre-built for this release:\r\n\r\n- v1.31.0: `kindest/node:v1.31.0@sha256:53df588e04085fd41ae12de0c3fe4c72f7013bba32a20e7325357a1ac94ba865`\r\n- v1.30.4: `kindest/node:v1.30.4@sha256:976ea815844d5fa93be213437e3ff5754cd599b040946b5cca43ca45c2047114`\r\n- v1.30.3: `kindest/node:v1.30.3@sha256:bf91e1ef2f7d92bb7734b2b896b3dddea98f0496b34d96e37dd5d7df331b7e56`\r\n- v1.29.8: `kindest/node:v1.29.8@sha256:d46b7aa29567e93b27f7531d258c372e829d7224b25e3fc6ffdefed12476d3aa`\r\n- v1.29.7: `kindest/node:v1.29.7@sha256:f70ab5d833fca132a100c1f95490be25d76188b053f49a3c0047ff8812360baf`\r\n- v1.28.13: `kindest/node:v1.28.13@sha256:45d319897776e11167e4698f6b14938eb4d52eb381d9e3d7a9086c16c69a8110`\r\n- v1.28.12: `kindest/node:v1.28.12@sha256:fa0e48b1e83bb8688a5724aa7eebffbd6337abd7909ad089a2700bf08c30c6ea`\r\n- v1.27.16: `kindest/node:v1.27.17@sha256:3fd82731af34efe19cd54ea5c25e882985bafa2c9baefe14f8deab1737d9fabe`\r\n- v1.26.15: `kindest/node:v1.26.15@sha256:1cc15d7b1edd2126ef051e359bf864f37bbcf1568e61be4d2ed1df7a3e87b354`\r\n- v1.25.16: `kindest/node:v1.25.16@sha256:6110314339b3b44d10da7d27881849a87e092124afab5956f2e10ecdb463b025`\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: You *must* use the `@sha256` digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme.

Updates logic on finding intersecting route and Listener hostnames to factor in the other Listeners on a Gateway that the route in question may not actually be attached to. Requests should be \"isolated\" to the most specific Listener and it's attached routes.\r\n\r\n(#6162, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Update examples for monitoring Contour and Envoy\r\n\r\nUpdates the [documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/guides/prometheus/) and examples for deploying a monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana) to scrape metrics from Contour and Envoy. Adds a metrics port to the Envoy DaemonSet/Deployment in the example YAMLs to expose port `8002` so that `PodMonitor` resources can be used to find metrics endpoints.\r\n\r\n(#6269, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Update to Gateway API v1.1.0\r\n\r\nGateway API CRD compatibility has been updated to release v1.1.0.\r\n\r\nNotable changes for Contour include:\r\n- The `BackendTLSPolicy` resource has undergone some breaking changes and has been updated to the `v1alpha3` API version. This will require any existing users of this policy to uninstall the v1alpha2 version before installing this newer version.\r\n- `GRPCRoute` has graduated to GA and is now in the `v1` API version.\r\n\r\nFull release notes for this Gateway API release can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.1.0).\r\n\r\n(#6398, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Add Circuit Breaker support for Extension Services\r\n\r\nThis change enables the user to configure the Circuit breakers for extension services either via the global Contour config or on an individual Extension Service.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The `PerHostMaxConnections` is now also configurable via the global settings.\r\n\r\n(#6539, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## Fallback Certificate: Add Global Ext Auth support\r\n\r\nApplies Global Auth filters to Fallback certificate\r\n\r\n(#6558, @erikflores7)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: handle Route conflicts with GRPCRoute.Matches\r\n\r\nIt's possible that multiple GRPCRoutes will define the same Match conditions. In this case the following logic is applied to resolve the conflict:\r\n\r\n- The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with a creation timestamp of \u201c2020-09-08 01:02:03\u201d is given precedence over a Route with a creation timestamp of \u201c2020-09-08 01:02:04\u201d.\r\n- The Route appearing first in alphabetical order (namespace/name) for example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.\r\n\r\nWith above ordering, any GRPCRoute that ranks lower, will be marked with below conditions accordingly:\r\n1. If only partial rules under this GRPCRoute are conflicted, it's marked with `Accepted: True` and `PartiallyInvalid: true` Conditions and Reason: `RuleMatchPartiallyConflict`.\r\n2. If all the rules under this GRPCRoute are conflicted, it's marked with `Accepted: False` Condition and Reason `RuleMatchConflict`.\r\n\r\n(#6566, @lubronzhan)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Fixes bug where external authorization policy was ignored on HTTPProxy direct response routes. (#6426, @shadialtarsha)\r\n- Updates to Kubernetes 1.30. Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30. (#6444, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Enforce `deny-by-default` approach on the `admin` listener by matching on exact paths and on `GET` requests (#6447, @davinci26)\r\n- Add support for defining equal-preference cipher groups ([cipher1|cipher2|...]) and permit `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` to be used separately. (#6461, @tsaarni)\r\n- allow `/stats/prometheus` route on the `admin` listener. (#6503, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n- Improve shutdown manager query to the Envoy stats endpoint for active connections by utilizing a regex filter query param. (#6523, @therealak12)\r\n- Updates to Go 1.22.5. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.minor) for more information. (#6563, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.31.0. See the [Envoy release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.31.0/version_history/v1.31/v1.31.0) for more information about the content of the release. (#6569, @skriss)\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contour sample YAML manifests no longer use `prometheus.io/` annotations\r\n\r\nThe annotations for notifying a Prometheus instance on how to scrape metrics from Contour and Envoy pods have been removed from the deployment YAMLs and the Gateway provisioner.

With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.\r\nA successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.\r\nPlease ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.\r\n\r\n### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names\r\n\r\nStarting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:\r\n\r\n- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"utf8-strict-mode\"`.\r\n\r\n- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.\r\n\r\nShould you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"classic-mode\"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-02-28T11:46:46Z", "project": "Alertmanager", "repo": "prometheus/alertmanager", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.4.1", "tag_name": "v2.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/releases/tag/v2.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant", "body": "CHANGELOG:\n\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/v2.4.1/CHANGELOG.md", "created_at": "2024-01-19T20:59:12Z", "project": "Vagrant", "repo": "hashicorp/vagrant", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v10.5", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gluster/glusterfs/commits/723d46f02cc87959a61afff11f3631e011a3cd56", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs", "body": "Add GlusterFS 10.5 release notes (#4262)\n\nUpdates: #4253\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Shwetha K Acharya <sacharya@redhat.com>", "created_at": "2023-11-14T14:36:43Z", "project": "Glusterfs", "repo": "gluster/glusterfs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.8.3", "tag_name": "v2.8.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/distribution/distribution/releases/tag/v2.8.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/docker/distribution", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* Pass `BUILDTAGS` argument to `go build` by @marcusirgens in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/3926\r\n* Enable Go build tags by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4009\r\n* `reference`: replace deprecated function `SplitHostname` by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4032\r\n* Dont parse errors as JSON unless Content-Type is set to JSON by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4054\r\n* update to go 1.20.8 by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4056\r\n* Set `Content-Type` header in registry client `ReadFrom` by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4053\r\n* deprecate reference package, migrate to github.com/distribution/reference by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4063\r\n* `digestset`: deprecate package in favor of `go-digest/digestset`  by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4064\r\n* Do not close HTTP request body in HTTP handler by @milosgajdos in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4068\r\n* Add v2.8.3 release notes by @milosgajdos in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4088\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @marcusirgens made their first contribution in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/3926\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/distribution/distribution/compare/v2.8.2...v2.8.3", "created_at": "2023-10-02T17:48:45Z", "project": "Distribution", "repo": "docker/distribution", "type": "Registry", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.33", "tag_name": "v1.0.33", "html_url": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/releases/tag/v1.0.33", "repo_url": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification", "body": "Specification release v1.0.33", "created_at": "2023-08-17T21:13:27Z", "project": "TUF", "repo": "theupdateframework/specification", "type": "Software Update", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.11.4", "tag_name": "v0.11.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.11.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint", "body": "## 0.11.4 (August 9, 2023)\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* plugin/aws/ecr-pull: Support entrypoint injection in ecr-pull builder [[GH-4847](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/4847)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* cli: Fix possible issues with deleted applications or projects failing to render in output [[GH-4867](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/4867)]\n* runneruninstall/aws-ecs: Fix installing runners in new AWS accounts by fixing an inline policy syntax error.
