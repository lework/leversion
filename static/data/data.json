Issue [#53532](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/53532)\n\n\nStarting at 9.1.0, existing heatmap panels will start using a new implementation.  This can be disabled by setting the `useLegacyHeatmapPanel` feature flag to true.  It can be tested on a single dashbobard by adding `?__feature.useLegacyHeatmapPanel=true` to any dashboard URL.  Please report any [heatmap migration issues.](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/new/choose).  The most notable changes are:\n* Significantly improved rendering performance\n* When calculating heatmaps, the buckets are now placed on reasonable borders (1m, 5m, 30s etc)\n* Round cells are no longer supported\n Issue [#50229](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/50229)\n\n### Plugin development fixes & changes\n\n- **Plugins:** Only pass `rootUrls` field in request when not empty.

Podman Desktop is still in its early days, but already provides capabilities to list your images, interact with containers (access logs, get a terminal), connect to registries (pull private images, push your images) and configure podman settings (proxies).\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Podman now supports the Gitlab Runner (using the Docker executor), allowing its use in Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.\r\n- A new command has been added, `podman pod clone`, to create a copy of an existing pod. It supports several options, including `--start` to start the new pod, `--destroy` to remove the original pod, and `--name` to change the name of the new pod ([#12843](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12843)).\r\n- A new command has been added, `podman volume reload`, to sync changes in state between Podman's database and any configured volume plugins ([#14207](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14207)).\r\n- A new command has been added, `podman machine info`, which displays information about the host and the versions of various machine components.\r\n- Pods created by `podman play kube` can now be managed by systemd unit files. This can be done via a new systemd service, `podman-kube@.service` - e.g. `systemctl --user start podman-play-kube@$(systemd-escape my.yaml).service` will run the Kubernetes pod or deployment contained in `my.yaml` under systemd.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now honors the `RunAsUser`, `RunAsGroup`, and `SupplementalGroups` setting from the Kubernetes pod's security context.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports volumes with the `BlockDevice` and `CharDevice` types ([#13951](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13951)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now features a new flag, `--userns`, to set the user namespace of created pods. Two values are allowed at present: `host` and `auto` ([#7504](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7504)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports setting the type of created init containers via the `io.podman.annotations.init.container.type` annotation.\r\n- Pods now have include an exit policy (configurable via the `--exit-policy` option to `podman pod create`), which determines what will happen to the pod's infra container when the entire pod stops. The default, `continue`, acts as Podman currently does, while a new option, `stop`, stops the infra container after the last container in the pod stops, and is used by default for pods from `podman play kube` ([#13464](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13464)).\r\n- The `podman pod create` command now allows the pod's name to be specified as an argument, instead of using the `--name` option - for example, `podman pod create mypod` instead of the prior `podman pod create --name mypod`. Please note that the `--name` option is not deprecated and will continue to work.\r\n- The `podman pod create` command's `--share` option now supports adding namespaces to the set by prefacing them with `+` (as opposed to specifying all namespaces that should be shared) ([#13422](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13422)).\r\n- The `podman pod create` command has a new option, `--shm-size`, to specify the size of the `/dev/shm` mount that will be shared if the pod shares its UTS namespace ([#14609](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14609)).\r\n- The `podman pod create` command has a new option, `--uts`, to configure the UTS namespace that will be shared by containers in the pod.\r\n- The `podman pod create` command now supports setting pod-level resource limits via the `--cpus`, `--cpuset-cpus`, and `--memory` options. These will set a limit for all containers in the pod, while individual containers within the pod are allowed to set further limits. Look forward to more options for resource limits in our next release!\r\n- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands now include the `-c` short option for the `--cpu-shares` option.\r\n- The `podman create` and `podman run` commands can now create containers from a manifest list (and not an image) as long as the `--platform` option is specified ([#14773](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14773)).\r\n- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--cpp-flag`, to specify options for the C preprocessor when using `Containerfile.in` files that require preprocessing.\r\n- The `podman build` command now supports a new option, `--build-context`, allowing the user to specify an additional build context.\r\n- The `podman machine inspect` command now prints the location of the VM's Podman API socket on the host ([#14231](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14231)).\r\n- The `podman machine init` command on Windows now fetches an image with packages pre-installed ([#14698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14698)).\r\n- Unused, cached Podman machine VM images are now cleaned up automatically. Note that because Podman now caches in a different directory, this will not clean up old images pulled before this change ([#14697](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14697)).\r\n- The default for the `--image-volume` option to `podman run` and `podman create` can now have its default set through the `image_volume_mode` setting in `containers.conf` ([#14230](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14230)).\r\n- Overlay volumes now support two new options, `workdir` and `upperdir`, to allow multiple overlay volumes from different containers to reuse the same `workdir` or `upperdir` ([#14427](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14427)).\r\n- The `podman volume create` command now supports two new options, `copy` and `nocopy`, to control whether contents from the overmounted folder in a container will be copied into the newly-created named volume (copy-up).\r\n- Volumes created using a volume plugin can now specify a timeout for all operations that contact the volume plugin (replacing the standard 5 second timeout) via the `--opt o=timeout=` option to `podman volume create` ([BZ 2080458](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080458)).\r\n- The `podman volume ls` command's `--filter name=` option now supports regular expression matching for volume names ([#14583](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14583)).\r\n- When used with a `podman machine` VM, volumes now support specification of the 9p security model using the `security_model` option to `podman create -v` and `podman run -v`.\r\n- The remote Podman client's `podman push` command now supports the `--remove-signatures` option ([#14558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14558)).\r\n- The remote Podman client now supports the `podman image scp` command.\r\n- The `podman image scp` command now supports tagging the transferred image with a new name.\r\n- The `podman network ls` command supports a new filter, `--filter dangling=`, to list networks not presently used by any containers ([#14595](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14595)).\r\n- The `--condition` option to `podman wait` can now be specified multiple times to wait on any one of multiple conditions.\r\n- The `podman events` command now includes the `-f` short option for the `--filter` option.\r\n- The `podman pull` command now includes the `-a` short option for the `--all-tags` option.\r\n- The `podman stop` command now includes a new flag, `--filter`, to filter which containers will be stopped (e.g. `podman stop --all --filter label=COM.MY.APP`).\r\n- The Podman global option `--url` now has two aliases: `-H` and `--host`.\r\n- The `podman network create` command now supports a new option with the default `bridge` driver, `--opt isolate=`, which isolates the network by blocking any traffic from it to any other network with the `isolate` option enabled. This option is enabled by default for networks created using the Docker-compatible API.\r\n- Added the ability to create sigstore signatures in `podman push` and `podman manifest push`.\r\n- Added an option to read image signing passphrase from a file.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Paused containers can now be killed with the `podman kill` command.\r\n- The `podman system prune` command now removes unused networks.\r\n- The `--userns=keep-id` and `--userns=nomap` options to the `podman run` and `podman create` commands are no longer allowed (instead of simply being ignored) with root Podman.\r\n- If the `/run` directory for a container is part of a volume, Podman will not create the `/run/.containerenv` file ([#14577](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14577)).\r\n- The `podman machine stop` command on macOS now waits for the machine to be completely stopped to exit ([#14148](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14148)).\r\n- All `podman machine` commands now only support being run as rootless, given that VMs only functioned when run rootless.\r\n- The `podman unpause --all` command will now only attempt to unpause containers that are paused, not all containers.\r\n- Init containers created with `podman play kube` now default to the `once` type ([#14877](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14877)).\r\n- Pods created with no shared namespaces will no longer create an infra container unless one is explicitly requested ([#15048](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15048)).\r\n- The `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman cp` commands can now autocomplete paths in the image or container via the shell completion.\r\n- The `libpod/common` package has been removed as it's not used anywhere.\r\n- The `--userns` option to `podman create` and `podman run` is no longer accepted when an explicit UID or GID mapping is specified ([#15233](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15233)).\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where bind-mounting `/dev` into a container which used the `--init` flag would cause the container to fail to start ([#14251](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14251)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman image mount` command would not pretty-print its output when multiple images were mounted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume import` command would print an unrelated error when attempting to import into a nonexistent volume ([#14411](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14411)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system reset` command could race against other Podman commands ([#9075](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9075)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where privileged containers were not able to restart if the layout of host devices changed ([#13899](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13899)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman cp` command would overwrite directories with non-directories and vice versa.  A new `--overwrite` flag to `podman cp` allows for retaining the old behavior if needed ([#14420](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14420)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine ssh` command would not preserve the exit code from the command run via ssh ([#14401](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14401)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where VMs created by `podman machine` would fail to start when created with more than 3072MB of RAM on Macs with M1 CPUs ([#14303](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14303)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init` command would fail when run from `C:\\Windows\\System32` on Windows systems ([#14416](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14416)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init --now` did not respect proxy environment variables ([#14640](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14640)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init` command would fail if there is no `$HOME/.ssh` dir ([#14572](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14572)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init` command would add a connection even if creating the VM failed ([#15154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15154)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where interrupting the `podman machine start` command could render the VM unable to start.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine list --format` command would still print a heading.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine list` command did not properly set the `Starting` field ([#14738](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14738)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command could fail to start QEMU VMs when the machine name started with a number.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman Machine VMs with proxy variables could not be started more than once ([#14636](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14636) and [#14837](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14837)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created using the Podman API would, when the Podman API service was managed by systemd, be killed when the API service was stopped ([BZ 2052697](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052697)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman -h` command did not show help output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman wait` command (and the associated REST API endpoint) could return before a container had fully exited, breaking some tools like the Gitlab Runner.\r\n- Fixed a bug where healthchecks generated `exec` events, instead of `health_status` events ([#13493](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13493)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod ps` command could return an error when run at the same time as `podman pod rm` ([#14736](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14736)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman systemd df` command incorrectly calculated reclaimable storage for volumes ([#13516](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13516)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where an exported container checkpoint using a non-default OCI runtime could not be restored.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman, when used with a recent runc version, could not remove paused containers.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman manifest rm` command would remove images, not manifests ([#14763](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14763)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman did not correctly parse wildcards for device major number in the `podman run` and `podman create` commands' `--device-cgroup-rule` option.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command on 32 bit systems where the total memory was calculated incorrectly ([#14819](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14819)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command could set ports and hostname incorrectly in generated YAML ([#13030](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13030)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system df --format \"{{ json . }}\"` command would not output the `Size` and `Reclaimable` fields ([#14769](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14769)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman pull` command would display duplicate progress output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command could leak memory when a client unexpectedly closed a connection when reading events or logs ([#14879](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14879)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman containers could fail to run if the image did not contain an `/etc/passwd` file ([#14966](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14966)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman push` command did not display progress information ([#14971](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14971)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a lock ordering issue could cause `podman pod rm` to deadlock if it was run at the same time as a command that attempted to lock multiple containers at once ([#14929](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14929)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman rm --force` command would exit with a non-0 code if the container in question did not exist ([#14612](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14612)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman container restore` command would fail when attempting to restore a checkpoint for a container with the same name as an image ([#15055](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15055)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest push --rm` command could remove image, instead of manifest lists ([#15033](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15033)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run --rm` command could fail to remove the container if it failed to start ([#15049](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15049)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would create incorrect unit files when the container was created with the `--sdnotify` parameter ([#15052](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15052)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would fail when `-h <hostname>` was used to create the container ([#15124](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/15124)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Docker-compatible API now supports API version v1.41 ([#14204](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14204)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created via the Libpod API had an incorrect umask set ([#15036](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15036)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `remote` parameter to the Libpod API's Build endpoint for Images was nonfunctional ([#13831](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13831)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod List endpoint for Containers did not return the `application/json` content type header when there were no containers present ([#14647](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14647)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Stats endpoint for Containers could return incorrect memory limits ([#14676](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14676)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat List and Inspect endpoints for Containers could return incorrect strings for container status.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle disabling healthchecks ([#14493](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14493)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Networks did not support the `mtu`, `name`, `mode`, and `parent` options ([#14482](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14482)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Networks did not allow the creation of networks name `bridge` ([#14983](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14983)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Networks did not properly set netmasks in the `SecondaryIPAddresses` and `SecondaryIPv6Addresses` fields ([#14674](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14674)).\r\n- The Libpod Stats endpoint for Pods now supports streaming output via two new parameters, `stream` and `delay` ([#14674](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14674)).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Podman will now check for nameservers in `/run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf` if the `/etc/resolv.conf` file only contains a localhost server.\r\n- The `podman build` command now supports caching with builds that specify `--squash-all` by allowing the `--layers` flag to be used at the same time.\r\n- Podman Machine support for QEMU installations at non-default paths has been improved.\r\n- The `podman machine ssh` command no longer prints spurious warnings every time it is run.\r\n- When accessing the WSL prompt on Windows, the rootless user will be preferred.\r\n- The `podman info` command now includes a field for information on supported authentication plugins for improved Docker compatibility. Authentication plugins are not presently supported by Podman, so this field is always empty.\r\n- The `podman system prune` command now no longer prints the `Deleted Images` header if no images were pruned.\r\n- The `podman system service` command now automatically creates and moves to a sub-cgroup when running in the root cgroup ([#14573](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14573)).\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.27.0\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.22.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.42.0\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.49.1\r\n- Podman will automatically create a sub-cgroup and move itself into it when it detects that it is running inside a container ([#14884](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14884)).\r\n- Fixed an incorrect release note about regexp.\r\n- A new MacOS installer (via pkginstaller) is now supported.\r\n", "created_at": "2022-08-11T00:44:03Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.2.7", "tag_name": "v1.2.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.2.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform", "body": "## 1.2.7 (August 10, 2022)\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* config: Check for direct references to deprecated computed attributes.

08-08-2022\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): allow configuring additional HTTP request headers for `-datasource.url`, `-remoteWrite.url` and `-remoteRead.url` via `-datasource.headers`, `-remoteWrite.headers` and `-remoteRead.headers` command-line flags. Additional HTTP request headers also can be set on group level via `headers` param - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#groups) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2860).\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): execute left and right sides of certain operations in parallel. For example, `q1 or q2`, `aggr_func(q1) <op> q2`, `q1 <op> aggr_func(q1)`. This may improve query performance if VictoriaMetrics has enough free resources for parallel processing of both sides of the operation. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2886).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): allow multiple sections with duplicate `username` but with different `password` values at `-auth.config` file.\r\n* FEATURE: add ability to push internal metrics (e.g. metrics exposed at `/metrics` page) to the configured remote storage from all the VictoriaMetrics components. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#push-metrics).\r\n* FEATURE: improve performance for heavy queries over big number of time series on systems with big number of CPU cores. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2896). Thanks to @zqyzyq for [the idea](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/commit/b596ac3745314fcc170a14e3ded062971cf7ced2).\r\n* FEATURE: improve performance for registering new time series in `indexdb` by up to 50%. Thanks to @ahfuzhang for [the issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2249).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add ability to specify tenantID in target labels. In this case metrics from the given target are routed to the given `__tenant_id__`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#multitenancy) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2943).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add service discovery for [Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#yandexcloud_sd_configs) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1386).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui). Zoom in the graph by selecting the needed time range in the same way Grafana does. Hold `ctrl` (or `cmd` on MacOS) in order to move the graph to the left/right. Hold `ctrl` (or `cmd` on MacOS) and scroll up/down in order to zoom in/out the area under the cursor. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2812).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): fix potential panic in [multi-level cluster setup](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multi-level-cluster-setup) when top-level `vmselect` is configured with `-replicationFactor` bigger than 1. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2961).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly handle custom `endpoint` value in [ec2_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#ec2_sd_config). It was ignored since [v1.77.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1770) because of a bug in the implementation of [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1287). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2917).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add missing `__meta_kubernetes_ingress_class_name` meta-label for `role: ingress` service discovery in Kubernetes. See [this commit from Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/commit/7e65ad3e432bd2837c17e3e63e85dcbcc30f4a8a).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): allow stale responses from Consul service discovery (aka [consul_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#consul_sd_config)) by default in the same way as Prometheus does. This should reduce load on Consul when discovering big number of targets. Stale responses can be disabled by specifying `allow_stale: false` option in `consul_sd_config`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2940).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): [dockerswarm_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#dockerswarm_sd_config): properly set `__meta_dockerswarm_container_label_*` labels instead of `__meta_dockerswarm_task_label_*` labels as Prometheus does. See [this issue](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9187).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): set `up` metric to `0` for partial scrapes in [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode). Previously the `up` metric was set to `1` when at least a single metric has been scraped before the error. This aligns the behaviour of `vmselect` with Prometheus.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): restart all the scrape jobs during [config reload](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#configuration-update) after `global` section is changed inside `-promscrape.config`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2884).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly assume role with AWS ECS credentials. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2875). Thanks to @transacid for [the fix](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2876).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not split regex in [relabeling rules](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling) into multiple lines if it contains groups. This fixes [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2928).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): return series from `q1` if `q2` doesn't return matching time series in the query `q1 ifnot q2`. Previously series from `q1` weren't returned in this case.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): properly show date picker at `Table` tab. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2874).\r\n* BUGFIX: properly generate http redirects if `-http.pathPrefix` command-line flag is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2918).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run

The\r\n    behaviour is unchanged if both or none are specified. However, if only one\r\n    of the two is set the other won't have a default value anymore and will be\r\n    ignored. See [Packer Plugin SDK change](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/pull/116) for details\r\n\r\n* packer-plugin-digitalocean: The Digital Ocean Packer plugin has been handed over\r\n    to the Digital Ocean team. New releases for this plugin are available at\r\n    https://github.com/digitalocean/packer-plugin-digitalocean. This plugin is\r\n    still being bundled in the Packer binary but will be removed in a future\r\n    release. Existing references to the plugin will continue to work but\r\n    users are advised to update the required_plugins block to use the new\r\n    plugin source address.\r\n    [GH-11912](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11912)\r\n```\r\nrequired_plugins {\r\n    digitalocean = {\r\n     source =  \"github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean\"\r\n     version = \">=1.0.8\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* packer-plugin-outscale:  The Outscale Packer plugin managed by the Outscale\r\n    team, since Packer 1.7.9, has been removed from the Packer binary.

[GH-11912](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11912)\r\n\r\n### FEATURES:\r\n* Future Scaffolding: This release contains additional changes that allow\r\n    Packer core to validate that a newly built image is a direct child of a HCP\r\n    Packer registry source image. This feature is only available for HCP Packer\r\n    enabled builds using the `hcp_packer_image` and `hcp_packer_iteration` data\r\n    source for setting a builder's source image.\r\n    [GH-11861](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11861)\r\n\r\n### PLUGINS:\r\n\r\nThe following external plugins have been updated and pinned to address open\r\n    issues.

[GH-11909](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11909)\r\n* core: During long running builds the HCP Packer registry will mark a build as\r\n    timed out if it has not posted an update after a certain number of minutes. For HCP\r\n    Packer enabled builds a status update will now be sent every 2 minutes to\r\n    the registry to prevent long builds from being marked as timed\r\n    out. [GH-11846](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11846)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add `component_type` configuration argument to\r\n    support specifying an exact build image when multiple images exist in the\r\n    same provider and region for a given HCP Packer bucket iteration.\r\n    [GH-11872](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11872)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add support for `channel` as input argument to\r\n    retrieve an image from the associated iteration. If\r\n    using several images from a single iteration, you may prefer sourcing an\r\n    iteration first, and referencing it for subsequent uses, as every\r\n    `hcp_packer_image` with the channel set will generate a potentially\r\n    billable HCP Packer request, but if several `hcp_packer_image`s use a\r\n    shared `hcp_packer_iteration` that will only generate one potentially\r\n    billable request.\r\n    [GH-11865](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11865)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when parsing malformed provisioner override blocks.\r\n    [GH-11881](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11881)\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when running `packer validate` on templates containing\r\n    one or more  HCP Packer data sources.\r\n    [GH-11883](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11883)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-08-02T09:55:28Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "RabbitMQ 3.10.7", "tag_name": "v3.10.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.10.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "body": "RabbitMQ `3.10.7` is a maintenance release in the `3.10.x` release series.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the upgrade section from [v3.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.10.0)\r\nif upgrading from a version prior to 3.10.0.\r\n\r\nThis release requires Erlang 24.x and supports Erlang 25.\r\n[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on\r\nErlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.10.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Classic queue that used CQv2 (2nd generation index and message store) could run into an exception when lazy mode\r\n   was enabled for them.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5252](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5252)\r\n\r\n * Stream coordinator now handles lots of client connections on a single stream more efficiently.\r\n   Previously its memory footprint was likely to begin creeping up.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5181](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5181)\r\n\r\n * In environments where DNS resolution is not yet available at the time RabbitMQ nodes boot and try to perform [peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html),\r\n   such as CoreDNS with default caching interval of 30s on Kubernetes, nodes now will retry\r\n   hostname resolution (including of their own host) several times with a wait interval.\r\n\r\n   The recommended solution is to [decrease CoreDNS caching interval](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5322](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5322)\r\n\r\n * Free disk space monitoring on Windows was reworked to rely on standard runtime features more instead\r\n   of a 3rd party, closed source `handle.exe`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#5241](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5241), [#4328](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4328)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Reduce log noise when `sysctl` cannot be accessed by node memory monitor.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5256](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5256)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Prometheus plugin now exposes one more metric, `process_start_time_seconds`, the moment of node process\r\n   startup in seconds.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4539](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4539)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Three more security-related response headers now can be set for all HTTP API endpoints:\r\n\r\n   * `X-Frame-Options`\r\n   * `X-Xss-Protection`\r\n   * `X-Content-Type-Options`\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   management.headers.content_type_options = nosniff\r\n   management.headers.xss_protection = 1;

Bundle: `opa bundle` command now supports `.yml` files ([#4859](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4859)) authored by @Joffref reported by @rdrgmnzsakt\r\n  - Plugins/Bundle: Use unique temporary files for persisting activated bundles to disk ([#4782](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4782)) authored by @FredrikAppelros reported by @FredrikAppelros\r\n  - Server: Old policy path is now checked for bundle ownership before update ([#4846](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4846))\r\n  - Storage+Bundle: Old bundle data is now cleaned before new bundle activation ([#4940](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4940))\r\n  - Bundle: Paths are now normalized before bundle root check occurs to ensure checks are os-independent\r\n\r\n#### Storage Fixes\r\n\r\nThe Storage system received mostly bugfixes, with a notable performance improvement for large bundles in this release:\r\n\r\n  - storage/inmem: Speed up bundle activation by avoiding unnecessary read operations ([#4898](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4898))\r\n  - storage/inmem: Paths are now created during truncate operations if they did not exist before\r\n  - storage/disk: Symlinks work with relative paths now ([#4869](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4869))\r\n\r\n### Rego and Topdown\r\n\r\nThe Rego compiler and runtime environment received a number of bugfixes, and a few new features this release, as well as a notable performance improvement for large Objects (covered above).\r\n\r\n- AST/Compiler: New method for obtaining parsed, but otherwise unprocessed modules is now available ([#4910](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4910))\r\n- `object.subset`: Support array + set combination ([#4858](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4858)) authored by @x-color\r\n- Compiler: Prevent erasure of `print()` statements in the compiler via a `WithEnablePrintStatements` option to `compiler.Compiler` and `compiler.optimizer` (authored by @kevinstyra)\r\n- Topdown fixes:\r\n  - AST/Builtins: `type_name` builtin now has more precise type metadata and improved docs\r\n  - Topdown/copypropagation: Ref-based tautologies like `input.a == input.a` are no longer eliminated during the copy-propagation pass ([#4848](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4848)) reported by @johanneskra\r\n  - Topdown/parse_units: Use big.Rat for units parsing to avoid floating-point rounding issues on fractional units. ([#4856](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4856)) reported by @tmos22\r\n  - Topdown: `is_valid` builtins no longer error, and should always return booleans ([#4760](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4760))\r\n  - Topdown: `glob.match` now can be used without delimiters ([#4923](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4923)) authored by @vinhph0906 reported by @vinhph0906\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n - Docs: Add GraphQL API authorization tutorial\r\n - Docs/bundles: Add bundle CLI command documentation

"https://github.com/projectcontour/contour", "body": "We are delighted to present version v1.22.0 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\nA big thank you to everyone who contributed to the release.\r\n\r\n# Major Changes\r\n\r\n## Update to Gateway API v0.5.0\r\n\r\nContour now supports Gateway API v0.5.0, including both the v1alpha2 and v1beta1 API versions.\r\n\r\nWith this update, Contour passes all of the Gateway API v0.5.0 conformance tests, which cover much of the core API surface (but are not yet 100% exhaustive).\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Gateway API v0.5.0 release, see [the release blog post](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/blog/2022/graduating-to-beta/).\r\n\r\nFor information on getting started with Contour and Gateway API, see the [Contour/Gateway API guide](https://projectcontour.io/guides/gateway-api/).\r\n\r\n(#4617, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## Update to Envoy 1.23.0\r\n\r\nContour now uses Envoy 1.23.0.\r\nSee [the Envoy changelog](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.23.0/version_history/v1.23/v1.23.0) for more information on the contents of the release.\r\n\r\n(#4621, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy Direct Response Policy\r\n\r\nHTTPProxy.Route now has a HTTPDirectResponsePolicy which allows for routes to specify a DirectResponsePolicy.\r\nThis policy will allow a direct response to be configured for a specific set of Conditions within a single route.\r\nThe Policy can be configured with a `StatusCode`, `Body`. And the `StatusCode` is required.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that one of route.services or route.requestRedirectPolicy or route.directResponsePolicy must be specified.\r\n\r\n(#4526, @yangyy93)\r\n\r\n## Validating revocation status of client certificates\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to enable revocation check for client certificates validation.\r\nThe CRL files must be provided in advance and configured as opaque Secret.\r\nTo enable the feature, `httpproxy.spec.virtualhost.tls.clientValidation.crlSecret` is set with the secret name.\r\n\r\n(#4592, @tsaarni)\r\n\r\n## Consolidate access logging and TLS cipher suite validation\r\n\r\nAccess log and TLS cipher suite configuration validation logic is now consolidated in the `apis/projectcontour/v1alpha1` package.\r\nExisting exported elements of the `pkg/config` package are left untouched, though implementation logic now lives in `apis/projectcontour/v1alpha1`.\r\n\r\nThis should largely be a no-op for users however, as part of this cleanup, a few minor incompatible changes have been made:\r\n- TLS cipher suite list elements will no longer be allowed to have leading or trailing whitespace\r\n- The ContourConfiguration CRD field `spec.envoy.logging.jsonFields` has been renamed to `spec.envoy.logging.accessLogJSONFields`\r\n\r\n(#4626, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: implement HTTP query parameter matching\r\n\r\nContour now implements Gateway API's [HTTP query parameter matching](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.HTTPQueryParamMatch).\r\nOnly `Exact` matching is supported.\r\nFor example, the following HTTPRoute will send a request with a query string of `?animal=whale` to `s1`, and a request with a querystring of `?animal=dolphin` to `s2`.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2\r\nkind: HTTPRoute\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: httproute-queryparam-matching\r\nspec:\r\n  parentRefs:\r\n  - name: contour-gateway\r\n  rules:\r\n  - matches:\r\n    - queryParams:\r\n      - type: Exact\r\n        name: animal\r\n        value: whale\r\n    backendRefs:\r\n    - name: s1\r\n  - matches:\r\n    - queryParams:\r\n      - type: Exact\r\n        name: animal\r\n        value: dolphin\r\n    backendRefs:\r\n    - name: s2\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#4588, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: update handling of various invalid HTTPRoute/TLSRoute scenarios\r\n\r\nUpdates the handling of various invalid HTTPRoute/TLSRoute scenarios to be conformant with the Gateway API spec, including:\r\n\r\n- Use a 500 response instead of a 404 when a route's backends are invalid\r\n- The `Accepted` condition on a route only describes whether the route attached successfully to its parent, not whether it has any other errors\r\n- Use the upstream reasons `InvalidKind` and `BackendNotFound` when a backend is not a Service or not found, respectively\r\n\r\n(#4614, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: enforce correct TLS modes for HTTPS and TLS listener protocols\r\n\r\nContour now enforces that the correct TLS modes are used for the HTTPS and TLS listener protocols.\r\nFor an HTTPS listener, the TLS mode \"Terminate\" must be used (this is compatible with HTTPRoutes).\r\nFor a TLS listener, the TLS mode \"Passthrough\" must be used (this is compatible with TLSRoutes).\r\n\r\n(#4631, @skriss)\r\n\r\n##  Bind create label operation for contour's deployment to the struct\r\n\r\nThere are now three places to create the same label(s), so let the operation to be a method of the Contour struct.\r\n\r\n(#4585, @izturn)\r\n\r\n## Use local variable to replace the long access chain of fields\r\n\r\nThe access chain of fields is too long, so use local variable to replace them.\r\n\r\n(#4586, @izturn)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- RTDS now serves dynamic runtime configuration layer which is requested by bootstrap configuration. In the future, contents of this runtime configuration will be made configurable by users. (#4387, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- internal/envoy: use Envoy's path-based prefix matching instead of regular expressions. (#4477, @mmalecki)\r\n- Gateway API: compute Listener supported kinds sooner, so it's populated in all cases where it can be computed. (#4523, @skriss)\r\n- When validating secrets, don't log an error for an Opaque secret that doesn't contain a `ca.crt` key. (#4528, @skriss)\r\n- Removes the `DebugLogLevel` and `KubernetesDebugLogLevel` fields from the `ContourConfiguration` spec since they were unused and are required to be specified via CLI flag. (#4534, @skriss)\r\n- Fixes TLS private key validation logic which previously ignored errors for PKCS1 and PKCS8 private keys. (#4544, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: return a 404 instead of a 503 when there are no valid backend refs for an HTTPRoute rule, to match the [revised Gateway API spec](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1151). (#4545, @skriss)\r\n- Update supported Kubernetes versions to 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24. (#4546, @skriss)\r\n- Changes the `contour envoy shutdown` command's `--check-delay` default to `0s` from `60s`, allowing Envoy pods to shut down more quickly when there are no open connections. (#4548, @skriss)\r\n- Update gopkg.in/yaml.v3 to v3.0.1 to address CVE-2022-28948. (#4551, @tsaarni)\r\n- Gateway API: adds support for the \"RequestMirror\" HTTPRoute filter type at the rule level. (#4557, @sepaper)\r\n- Gateway API: fixes a bug where routes with multiple parent refs to listeners would not attach to all listeners correctly. (#4558, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: wildcard hostnames can now match more than one DNS label, per https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1173. (#4559, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: adds support for ReferenceGrant, which was formerly known as ReferencePolicy. To ease migration, _both_ resources are supported for this release, but ReferencePolicy support will be removed next release. (#4580, @skriss)\r\n- Envoy will now make requests to gRPC ExtensionServices with a sanitized `:authority` header, rather than just using the extension cluster name. (#4587, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: adds logic to only keep the first HTTP header match with a given name (case-insensitive) for each HTTP route match, per the Gateway API spec. (#4593, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: replace usage of Contour-specific condition types and reasons with upstream Gateway API ones where possible (#4598, @skriss)\r\n- `contour cli` commands have been updated with new logging and support for testing incremental (delta) xDS variants. (#4602, @youngnick)\r\n- Gateway API: sets route parent status correctly when routes attach to specific Listeners. (#4604, @skriss)\r\n- Updated the list of supported envoy log template keywords. (#4610, @yangyy93)\r\n- Gateway API: set a Listener condition of `Ready: false` with reason `Invalid` when a Listener allows routes from a namespace selector but the selector is invalid. (#4615, @skriss)\r\n- Adds support for access log operators introduced in Envoy 1.23.0. See [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.23.0/version_history/v1.23/v1.23.0#new-features) for more details. (#4627, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Updated SITE_CONTRIBUTION.md to reflect Hugo platform. (#4620, @gary-tai)\r\n- Remove grey banner from main website page. (#4635, @gary-tai)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: ReferencePolicy is deprecated, will be removed next release\r\n\r\nGateway API has renamed ReferencePolicy to ReferenceGrant in the v0.5.0 release, while retaining the former for one release to ease migration.\r\nContour currently supports both, but will drop support for ReferencePolicy in the next release.\r\nUsers of ReferencePolicies must migrate their resources to ReferenceGrants ahead of the next Contour release.\r\n\r\n(#4580, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.22.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.22 through 1.24.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.

With the Ketama hashring, replication is currently handled by choosing subsequent nodes in the list of endpoints. This can lead to existing nodes getting more series when the hashring is scaled. This change makes replication to choose subsequent nodes from the hashring which should not create new series in old nodes when the hashring is scaled. Ketama hashring can be used by setting `--receive.hashrings-algorithm=ketama`.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#5337](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5337) Thanos Object Store: Add the `prefix` option to buckets.\r\n- [#5409](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5409) S3: Add option to force DNS style lookup.\r\n- [#5352](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5352) Cache: Add cache metrics to groupcache: `thanos_cache_groupcache_bytes`, `thanos_cache_groupcache_evictions_total`, `thanos_cache_groupcache_items` and `thanos_cache_groupcache_max_bytes`.\r\n- [#5391](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5391) Receive: Add relabeling support with the flag `--receive.relabel-config-file` or alternatively `--receive.relabel-config`.\r\n- [#5408](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5408) Receive: Add support for consistent hashrings. The flag `--receive.hashrings-algorithm` uses default `hashmod` but can also be set to `ketama` to leverage consistent hashrings. More technical information can be found here: https://dgryski.medium.com/consistent-hashing-algorithmic-tradeoffs-ef6b8e2fcae8.\r\n- [#5402](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5402) Receive: Implement api/v1/status/tsdb.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#5410](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5410) Query: Close() after using query. This should reduce bumps in memory allocations.\r\n- [#5417](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5417) Ruler: *Breaking if you have not set this value (`--eval-interval`) yourself and rely on that value. :warning:*. Change the default evaluation interval from 30s to 1 minute in order to be compliant with Prometheus alerting compliance specification: https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/blob/main/alert_generator/specification.md#executing-an-alerting-rule.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @jmjf made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5319\r\n* @fgouteroux made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5339\r\n* @heylongdacoder made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5324\r\n* @bisakhmondal made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5239\r\n* @djdongjin made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5383\r\n* @nicolastakashi made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5387\r\n* @roastiek made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5394\r\n* @B0go made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5392\r\n* @jademcosta made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5337\r\n* @dudaduarte made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5337\r\n* @Jakob3xD made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5409\r\n* @4xoc made their first contribution in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5153\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0", "created_at": "2022-07-05T14:22:26Z", "project": "Thanos", "repo": "thanos-io/thanos", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release v2.6.6", "tag_name": "v2.6.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rancher/rancher", "body": "**Rancher v2.6.6 is a mirror release of [v2.6.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.5) with one change to address the following issue:**\r\n\r\n- A major performance issue was occurring when Rancher was attempting to control large volumes of traffic from downstream clusters.
