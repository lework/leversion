In addition, the following max hop limits will be set by default:\r\n\r\n * worker and API server Nodes, and bastions, will have a limit of 1 hop.\r\n * control plane nodes will have a limit of 3 hops to accommodate for controller Pods without host networking that need to assume roles.\r\n\r\nThis will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  instanceMetadata:\r\n    httpTokens: optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External ServiceAccountPermissions\r\n\r\nMany of kOps addons can now make direct use of external permissions.\r\nThis can be enabled by adding the following to the Cluster spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  iam:\r\n    useServiceAccountExternalPermissions: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only available using the AWS cloud provider.\r\n\r\n## Managed nvidia instances\r\n\r\nkOps can now provision instances with nvidia GPUs and configure it for container workloads without the need of hooks and operators. See [GPU support](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/gpu/)\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* New clusters on AWS will no longer provision an SSH public key by default. To provision\r\n  an SSH public key on a new cluster, use the `--ssh-public-key` flag to `kops create cluster`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. This defers changes to these files until the time of `terraform apply`.\r\n  This feature may be temporarily disabled by turning off the `TerraformManagedFiles` feature flag\r\n  using `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=\"-TerraformManagedFiles\"`.\r\n\r\n* kOps now implements graceful rotation of its Certificate Authorities and the service\r\n  account signing key. See the documentation on [How to rotate all secrets / credentials](../operations/rotate-secrets.md)\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports Debian 11 (Bullseye).\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) as a drop-in replacement for dns-controller.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Control plane pods no longer mount /srv/kubernetes\r\n\r\n For security reasons, `/srv/kubernetes` is no longer mounted in the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager Pods. This also means the files in the default file assets path will be unavailable. If you have file assets or other files needed by kube-apiserver, you must put these into `/srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/` or `/srv/kubernetes/kube-controller-manager`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor file assets, it means adding an explicit path as shown below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  fileAssets:\r\n  - name: audit-policy-config\r\n    path: /srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/audit-policy-config.yaml # make sure you add the path\r\n    roles:\r\n    - Master\r\n    content: |\r\n      apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\r\n      kind: Policy\r\n      rules:\r\n      - level: Metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The legacy addons from `https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons` have been deprecated and will not be available in Kubernetes 1.23+. Use [managed addons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons) instead.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The `assets` phase of `kops update cluster` has been removed. It is replaced by the new `kops get assets --copy` command.\r\n\r\n* Support for importing and converting kubeup clusters has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Cilium and RHEL 8 has been removed. Cilium users will need to migrate to a distribution with a newer Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n* Amazon Linux 2 users are encouraged to use the AMIs based on the 5.10 Linux kernel. See [the documentation](../operations/images.md#amazon-linux-2) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Terraform support now requires Terraform >=0.15.0.\r\n  Users on older versions must follow Terraform's recommended upgrade path of applying one minor version at a time prior to running `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. If, after upgrading kOps and applying a new Terraform plan,\r\n  you subsequently downgrade to an earlier version of kOps, the generated plan will delete these\r\n  files, breaking the cluster. Prior to applying the plan, you will need to orphan all the\r\n  `aws_s3_bucket_object` objects the plan wants to destroy. Use `terraform state rm` on each of them.\r\n  Then re-run `terraform plan` until there are no such objects in the plan.\r\n  \r\n  If you applied the plan without first orphaning all of these objects, fix the cluster by re-running\r\n  `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users of clusters with names beginning with digits will need to move resources prior to upgrading to kOps 1.22. Some of the following commands will need to be run depending on the particular cluster configuration. Confirm the Terraform plan doesn't destroy any of these resources before running `terraform apply`.\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # View the existing terraform resource names for the exact value to use\r\n  HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME=123-cluster-example-com\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_internet_gateway.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_internet_gateway.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_route_table.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_route_table.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* The `TerraformJSON` feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23. Only native HCL2 Terraform output will be supported.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* Support for shell completion has been substantially improved. kOps has added support for shell completion in `fish` and `PowerShell`.\r\n\r\n* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.\r\n\r\n* There is a new command `kops get assets` for listing image and file assets used by a cluster.\r\n  It also includes a `--copy` flag to copy the assets to local repositories.\r\n  See the documentation on [Using local asset repositories](../operations/asset-repository.md) for more information.\r\n  \r\n* kOps now provisions TLS server certificates signed by the Kubernetes general CA to kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.\r\n  The previous behavior of using self-signed certs may be restored by setting `kubeControllerManager.tlsCertFile` and/or\r\n  `kubeScheduler.tlsCertFile` to `\"\"` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now supports the wireguard protocol for transparent encryption.\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.22.0 release\r\n\r\n* Release 1.22.0 [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#12532](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12532)\r\n* Don't hard-code the SQS Queue ARN partition [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#12540](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12540)\r\n* Fix nil pointer error where containerd is not in use [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb) [#12374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12374)\r\n* Re-add ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions to CA IAM policy [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#12568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12568)\r\n* Upgrade AWS VPC CNI to 1.9.3 w/ k8s 1.22 support [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#12573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12573)\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-22T17:44:34Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.5-dev11", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/b4d0cd02c14d4db1cf54b0bd8ee328fb198553f3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.5-dev11\n\nReleased version 2.5-dev11 with the following main changes :\n    -

See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1695).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `show original labels` button per each scrape target displayed at `http://vmagent;8429/targets` page. This should improve debuggability for service discovery and relabeling issues similar to [this one](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1664). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1698).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: shard targets among cluster nodes after the relabeling is applied. This should guarantee that targets with the same set of labels go to the same `vmagent` node in the cluster. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1687).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: atomatically switch to [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode) if the response from the given target exceeds the command-line flag value `-promscrape.minResponseSizeForStreamParse`. This should reduce memory usage when `vmagent` scrapes targets with non-uniform response sizes (this is the case in Kubernetes monitoring).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: send Prometheus-like staleness marks in [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode). Previously staleness marks wern't sent in stream parsing mode. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: properly calculate `scrape_series_added` metric for targets in [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode). Previously it was set to 0 in stream parsing mode. See [more details about this metric](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/#automatically-generated-labels-and-time-series).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: expose `promscrape_series_limit_max_series` and `promscrape_series_limit_current_series` metrics at `http://vmagent:8429/metrics` for scrape targets with the [enabled series limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: return error if `sample_limit` or `series_limit` options are set when [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode) is enabled, since these limits cannot be applied in stream parsing mode.\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add `-remoteRead.disablePathAppend` command-line flag, which allows specifying the full `-remoteRead.url`. If `-remoteRead.disablePathAppend` is set, then `vmalert` doesn't add `/api/v1/query` suffix to `-remoteRead.url`.\r\n* FEATURE: add trigonometric functions, which are going to be added in [Prometheus 2.31](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/9239): [acosh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#acosh), [asinh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#asinh), [atan](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#atan), [atanh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#atanh), [cosh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#cosh), [deg](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#deg), [rad](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rad), [sinh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#sinh), [tan](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#tan), [tanh](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#tanh). Also add `atan2` binary operator. See [this pull request](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/9248).\r\n* FEATURE: consistently return the same set of time series from [limitk](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#limitk) function. This improves the usability of periodically refreshed graphs.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): varios UX improvements. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1711) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): add ability to specify HTTP headers, which will be sent in requests to backends. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1736).\r\n* FEATURE: add `/flags` page to all the VictoriaMetrics components. This page contains command-line flags passed to the component.\r\n* FEATURE: allow using tab separators additionally to whitespace separators when [ingesting data in Graphite plaintext protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-graphite-compatible-agents-such-as-statsd). Such separators are [supported by Carbon-c-relay](https://github.com/grobian/carbon-c-relay/commit/f3ffe6cc2b52b07d14acbda649ad3fd6babdd528).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmstorage: fix `unaligned 64-bit atomic operation` panic on 32-bit architectures (arm and 386). The panic has been introduced in v1.67.0.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert, vmauth: prevent from frequent closing of TCP connections established to backends under high load. This should reduce the number of TCP sockets in `TIME_WAIT` state at `vmalert` and `vmauth` under high load. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1704).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: correctly calculate alert ID including extra labels. Previously, ID for alert entity was generated without alertname or groupname. This led to collision, when multiple alerting rules within the same group producing same labelsets. E.g. expr: `sum(metric1) by (job) > 0` and expr: `sum(metric2) by (job) > 0` could result into same labelset `job: \"job\"`. The bugfix adds all extra labels right after receiving response from the datasource. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1734).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: fix links in [Web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#web). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1717).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: set `honor_timestamps: true` by default in [scrape configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) if this options isn't set explicitly. This aligns the behaviour with Prometheus.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: group scrape targets by the original job names at `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page like Prometheus does. Previously they were grouped by the job name after relabeling, which may result in unexpected empty target groups.

See #4358.\r\n- Resolved panic seen after deleting imported cluster. See [#35160](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35160).\r\n- The Istio chart has been updated to resolve a DNS issue when installing with releaseMirror mode enabled. See #30842.\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Tech Preview - Harvester Integration with Rancher\r\n\r\nRancher 2.6.1 introduces [Harvester v0.3.0](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v0.3/) as a new integration. This integration only works with Harvester version 0.3.0 or higher. A feature flag, enabled by default, provides access to the integration. When enabled, users can manage Harvester clusters within Rancher. See [#33605](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33605). \r\n\r\n- Import multiple Harvester clusters for multi-cluster/multi-site management.\r\n- Use Rancher RBAC and enterprise authentication to log into Harvester clusters.\r\n- Use Rancher Projects in Harvester so teams can keep their VMs separate and organized.\r\n- Provision Kubernetes clusters on Harvester. You can use Harvester's built-in CSI driver and load balancer for your Kubernetes workloads (cloud provider). To set up the cloud provider with Harvester, refer [here](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v0.3-dev/rancher/cloud-provider/#load-balancer-request-parameters). See [#4208](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4208).\r\n\r\n### Security Enhancements\r\n\r\n- RKE and RKE2 include new versions of Kubernetes that address an issue where symlink exchanges could allow host filesystem access. See [CVE-2021-25741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25741).\r\n- Role revisions are properly tracked for ClusterRoles associated to RoleBinding resources. This allows returning up-to-date schemas for users and not evaluating a user's access from stale access states. See [#34732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34732).\r\n\r\n### Fleet\r\n\r\n- Fleet can now manage clusters running other instances of Fleet. This enables Rancher to manage Harvester clusters, other Rancher instances, or stand alone Fleet. Becasue of this change, it is possible two Fleet agents are in a cluster. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- AKS clusters now display applicable upgrade versions only. See [#34161](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34161).\r\n- The AKS provisioner now correctly handles simultaneous Kubernetes version upgrades and node pool additions. See [#33426](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33426).\r\n- Fixed conflict errors for the impersonation cluster role causing requests to occasionally fail with an `unable to create impersonator account: error setting up impersonation for user u-xxxxx` error. See [#34671](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34671)\r\n- The Istio chart now allows upgrades of Istio in an air gapped environment. Upgrading will be limited to versions available at time of build. See [#30842](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30842).\r\n- The side navigation no longer shows an incorrect top-level \"Istio\" menu item after upgrading from Rancher v2.5.x with v1 Istio enabled. See [#4072](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4072).\r\n- Resource deletion has been updated to address multiple cases. See [#34761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34761).\r\n  - Nodes are correctly removed from the infrastructure provider when the cluster is deleted in Rancher. See [#34542](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34542).\r\n  - Nodes from a misconfigured node pool no longer remain in the cluster after being deleted. See [#34713](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34713).\r\n  - The deleted status of clusters are now synchronized across pages in Rancher. See [#33774](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33774).\r\n- Fixed an issue where Fleet would infinitely create cluster management secrets when no system namespace exists. See [#34776](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34776).\r\n- Migrating clusters to a different `FleetWorkspace` no longer results in the management cluster being deleted. See [#34744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34744).\r\n- The external IP address is now properly retrieved for Windows nodes in a custom RKE2 cluster. See Windows [#91](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/91).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n- The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to cattle-fleet-local-system. This change does not impact GitOps workflows. \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:** \r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n  - When using Kubernetes v1.21 with Windows Server 20H2 Standard Core, the patch \"2019-08 Servicing Stack Update for Windows Server\" must be installed on the node. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n- **The Fleet agent in the local cluster now lives in `cattle-fleet-local-system`.** Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **New steps for rolling back Rancher.** The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters.** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **New procedure to set up Azure cloud provider for RKE2.** For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs Kube Nodes.** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs.**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Legacy Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.1\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.13](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.13)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.1](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.1)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0 many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nPlease review the new Harvester feature flag introduced into 2.6.1 and its default status. Additional feature flags introduced in 2.6.0 are shown also for reference.\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tWe have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes 1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Tech Preview**: There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.\r\n    - There are issues around removing etcd nodes from a cluster. See [#34488](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34488).\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - Proxy behind individual downstream clusters is not working. See [#32633](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32633).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace. See [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support upgrading RKE2 versions. See Windows [#76](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/76).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561)\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n  - **GKE**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n- **Harvester - Tech Preview:**\r\n  - Harvester v0.3.0 doesn't support air gap environment installation. See [#34908](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34908).\r\n  - Harvester v0.3.0 doesn't support upgrade from v0.2.0 nor upgrade to future v1.0.0.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the resourceSet rancher-resource-set will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.10.4 will be available with the Rancher Istio Helm chart v100.0.0+up1.10.4. A previous version of Istio, 1.10.2, included a security fix for CVE-2021-34824. See [#32795](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32795).\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. Everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.21. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n- **Docker installs:** There are UI issues around startup time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800) and [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n- **Login to Rancher using ActiveDirectory with TLS:** See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).\r\n  - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an ActiveDirectory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Golang 1.15.\r\n  - The error received is \"Error creating ssl connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\"\r\n  - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting \"GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\" as an environment variable to Rancher server container.\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a port to a Deployment that was created initially without any ports using the legacy UI, users may encounter a `services <NAME> already exists` error. To work around this issue, the legacy UI should be used to make updates to the configuration of Deployments created using the legacy UI. See [#4159](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4159).\r\n  - When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted. See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).", "created_at": "2021-10-19T22:12:38Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.4.1", "tag_name": "v3.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v3.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "body": "### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine init` could, under some circumstances, create invalid machine configurations which could not be started ([#11824](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11824)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine list` command would not properly populate some output fields.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine rm` could leave dangling sockets from the removed machine ([#11393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11393)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman run --pids-limit=-1` was not supported (it now sets the PID limit in the container to unlimited) ([#11782](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11782)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman run` and `podman attach` could throw errors about a closed network connection when STDIN was closed by the client ([#11856](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11856)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stop` command could fail when run on a container that had another `podman stop` command run on it previously.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--sync` flag to `podman ps` was nonfunctional.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Windows and OS X remote clients' `podman stats` command would fail ([#11909](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11909)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command did not properly handle environment variables whose values contained an `=` ([#11891](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11891)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command could generate invalid annotations when run on containers with volumes that use SELinux relabelling (`:z` or `:Z`) ([#11929](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11929)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command would generate YAML including some unnecessary (set to default) fields (e.g. user and group, entrypoint, default protocol for forwarded ports) ([#11914](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11914), [#11915](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11915), and [#11965](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11965)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command could, under some circumstances, generate YAML including an invalid `targetPort` field for forwarded ports ([#11930](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11930)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's `podman info` command could, under some circumstances, not read available CGroup controllers ([#11931](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11931)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman container checkpoint --export` would fail to checkpoint any container created with `--log-driver=none` ([#11974](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11974)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers could panic when no options were passed to a bind mount of tmpfs ([#11961](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11961)).\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-19T21:15:02Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.7", "tag_name": "v1.7.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/releases/tag/v1.7.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/packer", "body": "Packer release version 1.7.7 with improved HCP Packer registry support", "created_at": "2021-10-19T15:12:27Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.317", "tag_name": "jenkins-2.317", "html_url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/releases/tag/jenkins-2.317", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins", "body": "_This is an automatically generated changelog draft for Jenkins weekly releases.\r\nSee https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/ for the official changelogs._\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\ude80 New features and improvements\r\n\r\n* [JENKINS-66714](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-66714) -

IP addresses behind a NAT in a Docker deployment). RabbitMQ node hostnames are now advertised as well\r\n  so that other peers can resolve them to get an externally visible IP address.\r\n\r\n  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/osiris#53](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/issues/53)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * More data is exposed via the `GET /metrics/detailed` endpoint.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3520](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3520)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When setting topic permissions, the list of exchanges in the UI now honors the\r\n   currently selected virtual host.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @LuisCusihuaman.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3545](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3545)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AWS Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * The plugin now logs more details for failed AWS API requests.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @tvhong-amazon (AWS)\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3579](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3579)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web STOMP Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * STOMP-over-WebSockets connections now can consume from [streams](https://rabbitmq.com/streams.html).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3509](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3509)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n* Osiris was [upgraded to `1.2.2`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.2)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.9.8.tar.xz` instead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-19T04:31:41Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.0.3", "tag_name": "v2.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.0.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "v2.0.3 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis release introduces several enhancements and bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Append instructions for CRI-O configuration #2271\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed: validation of cron expression #2315\r\n- Fixed: unexpected parameters in StressChaos #2349\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-19T04:16:42Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.12.0rc1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/634916b9cbf5c71a362e713e7181e223c4466e6f", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.12.0rc1 (#76072)", "created_at": "2021-10-18T14:42:52Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v10.0rc0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gluster/glusterfs/commits/387fcb01e2a47a848462ae6835ab8b04b60d9c73", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs", "body": "fuse: handle pid 0 (#2468)\n\n* There was no clue on which operation caused the pid to be '0' - Added relevant op in log.\r\n* When the error happened without setting ngroups, it crashed the process.\r\n* Looks like in container usecases, when namespace pid is different, there are chances of\r\n  fuse not getting proper pid, hence would have it as 0.

Default headers to set on all requests\r\n      request-headers:\r\n        set:\r\n          X-Envoy-Hostname: %HOSTNAME%\r\n        applyToIngress: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Push images to GHCR and Docker Hub in parallel (#4006)\r\n\r\nStarts pushing container images to GHCR in addition to Docker Hub.\r\nImages will be pushed to both registries for a period of time, until the Docker Hub push is removed.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the examples & quickstart will utilize the GHCR registry with images like: `ghcr.io/projectcontour/contour`.\r\n\r\n## Run Envoy as non-root (#4084)\r\n\r\nEnvoy no longer need to run as `root` but runs as `nobody`.\r\n\r\n## Make shutdown-ready file path configurable (#4084)\r\n\r\nThe shutdown-ready file path is now configurable, to allow user to optionally set a path that is writable by setting the `--ready-file` flag on the shutdown-manager.\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy Per-Route and Service Cookie Rewriting\r\n\r\nContour now enables users to customize attributes on HTTP `Set-Cookie` response headers.\r\nApplication specific cookies and cookies generated by Contour's [\"cookie\" load balancing strategy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.19.0/config/request-routing/#session-affinity) can be rewritten either per HTTPProxy `Route` or `Service`.\r\nUsers can choose to rewrite the `Path`, `Domain`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes of the `Set-Cookie` header currently.\r\nThese attributes may be things an application may not be able to accurately set, without prior knowledge of how the application is deployed.\r\nFor example, if Contour is in use to rewrite the path or hostname of a request before it reaches an application backend, the application may not be able to accurately set the `Path` and `Domain` attributes in a `Set-Cookie` response header.\r\nThis feature can be used to apply security settings to ensure browsers treat generated cookies appropriately.\r\nThe `SameSite` and `Secure` attributes are currently not set by Envoy when it generates the `X-Contour-Session-Affinity`, but with this feature, users can customize this cookie further.\r\nFuture iterations of this feature may provide cookie rewriting configuration directly as part of the cookie load balancing strategy configuration.\r\n\r\nSome more documentation and example configuration can be found [here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.19.0/config/cookie-rewriting/).\r\nAlso see Contour's CRD [API reference](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.19.0/config/api/) for more details.\r\n\r\n## ContourConfiguration CRD in Alpha\r\n\r\nContour uses a set of flags on the `contour serve` command as well as a configuration file represented as in a Kubernetes Configmap for further configuration of Contour & Envoy.\r\nIt has been difficult to manage the contents of that file (e.g. yaml in a configmap) along with having no way of properly validating that conifguration, so Contour has introduced\r\na new `ContourConfiguration` CRD which refactors the current config file along with any missing flags into a new object.\r\nThis new config is in an Alpha state while we verify the format of the configuration file along with its validation. \r\n\r\nContour will continue to support the current configuration file for some time, but looking ahead to the roadamp, `ContourConfiguration` will be the new way to configure Contour. \r\n\r\nAdditional details around the design of this change can be read in the design doc: https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/main/design/configuration-crd.md\r\n\r\n## New Changelog process\r\n\r\nContour now requires:\r\n\r\n- All PRs be labelled with a release-note/<category> label, where category is one of major, minor, small, docs, infra, or not-required.\r\n- A changelog file to be created in changelogs/unreleased for each PR, unless the category is not-required. The filename must be PR#-githubID-category, where githubID is that of the person opening the PR, and the category matches the label category.\r\n\r\n## Gateway API\r\n\r\n### Support TLSRoute weighted ForwardTos (#3938)\r\n\r\nAdd support for weighted ForwardTos in TLSRoute rules.\r\nPer spec, weights default to 1 if unspecified, and weights of 0 mean no traffic is forwarded to the backend.\r\n\r\n## Site\r\n\r\n### Alt attribute to images (#3917)\r\n\r\nAdds `alt` tags for better web accessibility.\r\n\r\nThanks @johnnycase for contributing this!\r\n\r\n### Website notice feature (#3955)\r\n\r\nAdds site formatting for projectcontour.io to have new \"warning\", \"note\", \"info\", and \"tip\" notices.\r\n\r\nThanks @gary-tai for contributing this!\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### Update security process docs post advisory (#3945)\r\n\r\nUpdates the security process should a new security advisory be discovered with Contour.\r\n\r\n### Add threat model and security posture documentation (#4011)\r\n\r\nAdds a Security document outlining Contour's threat model and how to report security issues.\r\n\r\n### Updates for Kubernetes 1.22 (#3953)\r\n\r\nUpdates Go modules, KinD images, and kubectl version to support Kubernetes 1.22.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct (#4032)\r\n\r\nUpdates the Code of Conduct to use the CNCF template.\r\n\r\nThanks @mzrithm for contributing this!\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\n\r\nPlease consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n## Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.19.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.20 through 1.22\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

This was slow for\nseveral reasons:\n\n* Type inference is generally slow for large collections (hash/array)\n* Iterable functions like `reduce` pass an accumulator to the block for each\n  iteration, so we inferred the accumulator's type multiple times.\n* When building a collection using `reduce`, the accumulator increases in size\n  each time. So constructions like the following infer the type of an\n  accumulator of size 0, 1, ..., N-1, which is equivalent to inferring the type\n  of an accumulator of size N(N-1)/2:\n\n      Integer[1, N].reduce([]) |$memo, $value| { $memo << $value}\n\nHowever, block arguments are often defined without a type, e.g. `$memo`, so the\ntype inference was wasted effort.\n\nThis commit switches from `callable?` to `callable_with?`. So rather than\ninferring the type of all arguments, and checking if those types are assignable\nto the parameter's type, we instead check if each argument is an instance of the\nparameter's type. For example, we check if the Ruby Hash {} is an instance of\nthe `PAnyType`, which is always true[1]. The `callable_with?` method also checks\nrequired and optional parameters and return types, like the `callable?` method\ndoes.\n\nNote the `callable_with?` method was introduced in 2edd30e0 to address similar\ntype inference slowness.\n\n[1] https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/7.11.0/lib/puppet/pops/types/types.rb#L268", "created_at": "2021-10-08T17:56:39Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.33", "tag_name": "v1.7.33", "html_url": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v1.7.33", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containous/traefik", "body": "**Bug fixes:**\r\n- **[acme]** acme: fix non-cluster mode ([#8501](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/8501) by [ldez](https://github.com/ldez))\r\n", "created_at": "2021-10-07T14:32:07Z", "project": "Traefik", "repo": "containous/traefik", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Longhorn v1.2.2 release", "tag_name": "v1.2.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.2.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "## Release Note\r\n\r\n> Please read the install/upgrade notes before installing/upgrading to this Longhorn version.\r\n\r\n**v1.2.2 released!** \ud83c\udf86\r\n\r\nThis release introduces important bug fixes as described below.

This has been achieved via migration to the latest Kubernetes constructs, ease of use improvements, bug fixes and most importantly refactoring the control plane and e2e test suites to independently enhance and release each of the engines. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them till Dec 2021. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.0.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.0.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.8.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.5.1 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.7.1 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.7.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.4.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.7 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Added support for pushing the [container images to GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/packages), in addition to pushing the to DockerHub and Quay.io.\r\n* Rename the branches to \"develop\" or \"main\" on all the active repositories which are accepting contributions. \r\n* Update the CRD references to v1 across all components - even with deprecated provisioners - so users can continue to use the older provisioners beyond 1.22 as well. \r\n* Update the Kubernetes CSI driver side-cars to the latest version compatible with Kubernetes 1.18 and higher. \r\n* Enhance the iSCSI Targets functionality in Jiva and cStor volumes to only accept connections from one node at a time. The connection from a new node will be accepted only after the previous connection is torn down. \r\n* Enhanced the Local PV hostpath with a feature to enforce capacity limits using XFS quota - for volumes provisioned on XFS filesystem. \r\n* Enhanced the Jiva Specs (Jiva Volume Policy) to remove unused fields and make most of the fields with default configuration as optional. Also fixed the issues around specifying pod affinity and anti-affinity policies on jiva replica and target.\r\n* Enhanced the NDM operator and helm chart to include NDM exporter. \r\n* Enhanced NDM to detect filesystem and size changes, and update the block device resource. (under feature-gate in this release).\r\n* Dashboard and CLI have made enhanced their support to display details about cStor, Jiva, ZFS, LVM and Device Local PV. \r\n* Enhanced OpenEBS helm chart that can easily enable or disable a data engine of choice. The 3.0 helm chart stops installing the legacy cstor and jiva provisioners. If you would like to continue to use them, you have to set the flag \u201clegacy.enabled=true\u201d. \r\n* OpenEBS helm chart includes sample kyverno policies that can be used as an option for PodSecurityPolicies(PSP) replacement. \r\n* New revamped website for [https://openebs.io](https://openebs.io) is live. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @turowicz(Surveily), @WillyRL(Teknologi Anak Rantau Indonesia), @Somsubhra1, @t3hmrman for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice. Note that pack is intended for local image builds, and thus requires a Docker daemon. The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nFor instructions on installing `pack`, see our [installation docs](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/cli/install/).\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nCLI for building apps using Cloud Native Buildpacks\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  builder               Interact with builders\r\n

If upgrading from Tempo v0.6.0 or earlier, then see the special upgrade instructions below.  Tempo v0.7.0 and later have no compatibility issues or special instructions.   \r\n\r\nTempo v0.6.0 and earlier used block formats v0 and v1, which are being deprecated, and support for these blocks will be removed in the next release.  To resolve this you must first upgrade to Tempo 0.7.0+ (latest 1.1 is recommended) which introduces the supported v2 block format.  Tempo will write all new blocks as v2, and it must continue running until all v0 and v1 blocks are gone (either deleted due to retention, or compacted).   Block versions can be checked using the tempo-cli [list blocks command](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/tempo_cli/#list-blocks).\r\n\r\n## New Features and Enhancements\r\n[FEATURE] Added the ability to hedge requests with all backends #750 (@joe-elliott)\r\n[FEATURE] Added a tenant index to reduce bucket polling. #834 (@joe-elliott)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Added hedged request metric tempodb_backend_hedged_roundtrips_total and a new storage agnostic tempodb_backend_request_duration_seconds metric that supersedes the soon-to-be deprecated storage specific metrics (tempodb_azure_request_duration_seconds, tempodb_s3_request_duration_seconds and tempodb_gcs_request_duration_seconds). #790 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Performance: improve compaction speed with concurrent reads and writes #754 (@mdisibio)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Improve readability of cpu and memory metrics on operational dashboard #764 (@bboreham)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add azure_request_duration_seconds metric. #767 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add s3_request_duration_seconds metric. #776 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add tempo_ingester_flush_size_bytes metric. #777 (@bboreham)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Microservices jsonnet: resource requests and limits can be set in $._config. #793 (@kvrhdn)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add -config.expand-env cli flag to support environment variables expansion in config file. #796 (@Ashmita152)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add ability to control bloom filter caching based on age and/or compaction level.

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Chunks storage has been deprecated and is now in maintenance mode.\r\n* Exemplars now supported - in-memory only.\r\n* Added many new limits, to help protect your installation against overload.\r\n* The sharding feature in Alertmanager is now considered complete.\r\n* Release now has ARM binaries and packages (but not container images, yet).\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Prevent path traversal attack from users able to control the HTTP header `X-Scope-OrgID`. #4375 (CVE-2021-36157)\r\n  * Users only have control of the HTTP header when Cortex is not frontended by an auth proxy validating the tenant IDs\r\n* [CHANGE] Enable strict JSON unmarshal for `pkg/util/validation.Limits` struct. The custom `UnmarshalJSON()` will now fail if the input has unknown fields. #4298\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage. No new features will be added to the chunks storage. The default Cortex configuration still runs the chunks engine; please check out the [blocks storage doc](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/) on how to configure Cortex to run with the blocks storage.  #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] The example Kubernetes manifests (stored at `k8s/`) have been removed due to a lack of proper support and maintenance. #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: deprecated `-store.query-chunk-limit` CLI flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`) in favour of `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`). The new limit specifies the maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query from ingesters and long-term storage: the total number of actual fetched chunks could be 2x the limit, being independently applied when querying ingesters and long-term storage. #4125\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: allowed to configure the experimental receivers firewall on a per-tenant basis. The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been changed and moved to the limits config section: #4143\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-cidr-networks`\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-private-addresses`\r\n* [CHANGE] Change default value of `-server.grpc.keepalive.min-time-between-pings` from `5m` to `10s` and `-server.grpc.keepalive.ping-without-stream-allowed` to `true`. #4168\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change default value of `-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` to `true`. This incurs a small increase in memory usage, between 1.2% and 1.6% as measured on ingesters with 1.3M active series. #4257\r\n* [CHANGE] Dependency: update go-redis from v8.2.3 to v8.9.0. #4236\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max series per query limit is enforced in the querier and applies to unique series received from ingesters and store-gateway (long-term storage). #4179\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier/Ruler: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max chunk bytes limit is enforced in the querier and ruler and limits the size of all aggregated chunks returned from ingesters and storage as bytes for a query. #4216\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: support negative matchers, time-based muting - [upstream release notes](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.22.0). #4237\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added rate-limits to notifiers. Rate limits used by all integrations can be configured using `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit`, while per-integration rate limits can be specified via `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration` parameter. Both shared and per-integration limits can be overwritten using overrides mechanism. These limits are applied on individual (per-tenant) alertmanagers. Rate-limited notifications are failed notifications. It is possible to monitor rate-limited notifications via new `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total` metric. #4135 #4163\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes` limit to control size of configuration files that Cortex users can upload to Alertmanager via API. This limit is configurable per-tenant. #4201\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-templates-count` and `-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes` options to control number and size of templates uploaded to Alertmanager via API. These limits are configurable per-tenant. #4223\r\n* [FEATURE] Added flag `-debug.block-profile-rate` to enable goroutine blocking events profiling. #4217\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: The experimental sharding feature is now considered complete. Detailed information about the configuration options can be found [here for alertmanager](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) and [here for the alertmanager storage](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_storage_config). To use the feature: #3925 #4020 #4021 #4031 #4084 #4110 #4126 #4127 #4141 #4146 #4161 #4162 #4222\r\n  * Ensure that a remote storage backend is configured for Alertmanager to store state using `-alertmanager-storage.backend`, and flags related to the backend. Note that the `local` and `configdb` storage backends are not supported.\r\n  * Ensure that a ring store is configured using `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store`, and set the flags relevant to the chosen store type.\r\n  * Enable the feature using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`.\r\n  * Note the prior addition of a new configuration option `-alertmanager.persist-interval`. This sets the interval between persisting the current alertmanager state (notification log and silences) to object storage. See the [configuration file reference](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) for more information.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Cleanup persisted state objects from remote storage when a tenant configuration is deleted. #4167\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Added the ability to disable Open Census within GCS client (e.g `-gcs.enable-opencensus=false`). #4219\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Etcd: Added username and password to etcd config. #4205\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: introduced new metrics to monitor operation when using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`: #4149\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_completed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: support ingesting exemplars and querying of exemplars.  Enabled by setting new CLI flag `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-exemplars=<n>` or config option `blocks_storage.tsdb.max_exemplars` to positive value. #4124 #4181\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added distributors ring status section in the admin page. #4151\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added zone-awareness support to alertmanager for use when sharding is enabled. When zone-awareness is enabled, alerts will be replicated across availability zones. #4204\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `tenant_ids` tag to tracing spans #4186\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring, query-frontend: Avoid using automatic private IPs (APIPA) when discovering IP address from the interface during the registration of the instance in the ring, or by query-frontend when used with query-scheduler. APIPA still used as last resort with logging indicating usage. #4032\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: introduced new metrics to aid troubleshooting tombstone convergence: #4231\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones_removed_total`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_messages_to_broadcast_dropped_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups` option to control max number of active dispatcher groups in Alertmanager (per tenant, also overrideable). When the limit is reached, Dispatcher produces log message and increases `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_group_limit_reached_total` metric. #4254\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-alerts-count` and `-alertmanager.max-alerts-size-bytes` to control max number of alerts and total size of alerts that a single user can have in Alertmanager's memory. Adding more alerts will fail with a log message and incrementing `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_insert_limited_total` metric (per-user). These limits can be overrided by using per-tenant overrides. Current values are tracked in `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts` and `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts_size_bytes` metrics. #4253\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` and `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-max-duration` support to store-gateway, to wait for ring stability at startup. #4271\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added `rule_group` label to metrics `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_total` and `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total`. #4121\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added new metrics for tracking total number of queries and push requests sent to ingester, as well as failed queries and push requests. Failures are only counted for internal errors, but not user-errors like limits or invalid query. This is in contrast to existing `cortex_prometheus_rule_evaluation_failures_total`, which is incremented also when query or samples appending fails due to user-errors. #4281\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Added option `-ingester.ignore-series-limit-for-metric-names` with comma-separated list of metric names that will be ignored in max series per metric limit. #4302\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added instrumentation to Redis client, with the following metrics: #3976\r\n  - `cortex_rediscache_request_duration_seconds`\r\n* [BUGFIX] Purger: fix `Invalid null value in condition for column range` caused by `nil` value in range for WriteBatch query. #4128\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed infrequent panic caused by a race condition between TSDB mmap-ed head chunks truncation and queries. #4176\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: fix Alertmanager status page if clustering via gossip is disabled or sharding is enabled. #4184\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix `/ruler/rule_groups` endpoint doesn't work when used with object store. #4182\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Honor the evaluation delay for the `ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` series. #4227\r\n* [BUGFIX] Make multiple Get requests instead of MGet on Redis Cluster. #4056\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix issue where runtime limits erroneously override default limits. #4246\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix startup in single-binary mode when the new `ruler_storage` is used. #4252\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix queries failing with \"at least 1 healthy replica required, could only find 0\" error right after scaling up store-gateways until they're ACTIVE in the ring. #4263\r\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: when blocks sharding is enabled, do not load all blocks in each store-gateway in case of a cold startup, but load only blocks owned by the store-gateway replica. #4271\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fix to setting the default configuration value for `-memberlist.retransmit-factor` when not provided. This should improve propagation delay of the ring state (including, but not limited to, tombstones). Note that if the configuration is already explicitly given, this fix has no effect. #4269\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix issue where samples in a chunk might get skipped by batch iterator. #4218\r\n\r\n## Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: add support for DynamoDB (v9 schema only). #3828\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add Cassandra support. #3795\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: retry failed uploads. #4188\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-05T09:18:00Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.0.3 (July 28, 2021)", "tag_name": "2.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases/tag/2.0.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos", "body": "In this version, Nacos community continue to do a lot of optimizations for the features of the upgrade from 1.X to 2.0.X, to improve the upgrade stability.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
