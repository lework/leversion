"v1.79.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.79.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "### Changes\r\n\r\n## [v1.79.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.79.0)\r\n\r\nReleased at 14-07-2022\r\n\r\n**Update note 1:** this release introduces backwards-incompatible changes to `vm_partial_results_total` metric by changing its labels to be consistent with `vm_requests_total` metric. If you use alerting rules or Grafana dashboards, which rely on this metric, then they must be updated. The official dashboards for VictoriaMetrics don't use this metric.\r\n\r\n**Update note 2:** [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) adds `/vmalert/` prefix to [web urls](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#web) according to [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2825). This may affect `vmalert` instances with non-empty `-http.pathPrefix` command-line flag. After the update, configuring this flag is no longer needed. Here's [why](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2799#issuecomment-1171392005).\r\n\r\n**Update note 3:** this release introduces backwards-incompatible changes to communication protocol between `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes in cluster version of VictoriaMetrics because of added ability to query `vmselect` data from other `vmselect` nodes - see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multi-level-cluster-setup), so read requests to `vmselect` will fail until the upgrade is complete. These errors will stop after all the `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes are updated to the new release. It is safe to downgrade to previous releases at any time.\r\n\r\n**Update note 4:** this release removes support of deprecated in [1.70.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.70.0) param `extra_filter_labels` from [vmalert's](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) groups definition. This deprecated param was replaced with [params](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#url-params).\r\n\r\n**Update note 5:** this release changes naming for published linux binaries at [releases](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases). Now names for binaries for all the supported platforms match the following template - `$(APP_NAME)-$(GOOS)-$(GOARCH)-$(VERSION).tar.gz`. For example, `victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.79.0.tar.gz`. Previously linux binaries didn't have `$(GOOS)` part, e.g. they had the name `victoria-metrics-amd64-v1.79.0.tar.gz`. Please update automation scripts for upgrading VictoriaMetrics releases according to this change.\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add [azure_sd_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#azure_sd_config) service discovery mechanism. It allows discovering Virtual Machines at [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1364).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): deprecate alert's status link `/api/v1/<groupID>/<alertID>/status` in favour of `/api/v1/alert?group_id=<group_id>&alert_id=<alert_id>`. The old alert's status link is still supported, but will be removed in future releases. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2825).\r\n* FEATURE: [cluster version of VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): add support for querying lower-level `vmselect` nodes from upper-level `vmselect` nodes. This makes possible to build multi-level cluster setups for global querying view and HA purposes without the need to use [Promxy](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multi-level-cluster-setup) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2778).\r\n* FEATURE: add `-search.setLookbackToStep` command-line flag, which enables InfluxDB-like gap filling during querying. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/migrate-from-influx.html) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add an UI for [query tracing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#query-tracing). It can be enabled by clicking `trace query` checkbox and re-running the query. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2703).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `-remoteWrite.headers` command-line option for specifying optional HTTP headers to send to the configured `-remoteWrite.url`. For example, `-remoteWrite.headers='Foo:Bar^^Baz:x'` would send `Foo: Bar` and `Baz: x` HTTP headers with every request to `-remoteWrite.url`. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2805).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): push per-target `scrape_samples_limit` metric to the cofigured `-remoteWrite.url` if `sample_limit` option is set for this target in [scrape_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/operator/issues/497).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): attach node-level labels to [kubernetes_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config) targets if `attach_metadata: {\"node\": true}` is set for `role: endpoints` and `role: endpointslice`. This is a feature backport from Prometheus 2.37 - see [this pull request](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/10759).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add ability to specify additional HTTP headers to send to scrape targets via `headers` section in `scrape_configs`. This can be used when the scrape target requires custom authorization and authentication like in [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66032498/prometheus-scrape-metric-with-custom-header). For example, the following config instructs sending `My-Auth: top-secret` and `TenantID: FooBar` headers with each request to `http://host123:8080/metrics`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nscrape_configs:\r\n- job_name: foo\r\n  headers:\r\n  - \"My-Auth: top-secret\"\r\n  - \"TenantID: FooBar\"\r\n  static_configs:\r\n  - targets: [\"host123:8080\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: add ability to pass `limit` query arg to `api/v1/series` endpoint. This can be used if only a sample of up to `limit` series must be returned from the endpoint. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2841) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prometheus-querying-api-enhancements).\r\n* FEATURE: [query tracing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#query-tracing): show timestamps in query traces in human-readable format (aka `RFC3339` in UTC timezone) instead of milliseconds since Unix epoch. For example, `2022-06-27T10:32:54.506Z` instead of `1656325974506`. This improves traces' readability.\r\n* FEATURE: improve performance of [/api/v1/series](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers) requests, which return big number of time series.\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): improve query performance when [replication is enabled](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#replication-and-data-safety).\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly handle partial counter resets in [remove_resets](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#remove_resets) function. Now `remove_resets(sum(m))` should returns the expected increasing line when some time series matching `m` disappear on the selected time range. Previously such a query would return horizontal line after the disappeared series.\r\n* FEATURE: expose `vm_next_retention_seconds` metric at `http://victoriametrics:8428/metrics`, which shows the number of seconds left until the next `indexdb` rotation. Thanks to @guidao for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2863).\r\n* FEATURE: expose additional histogram metrics at `http://victoriametrics:8428/metrics`, which may help understanding query workload:\r\n\r\n  * `vm_rows_read_per_query` - the number of raw samples read per query.\r\n  * `vm_rows_scanned_per_query` - the number of raw samples scanned per query. This number can exceed `vm_rows_read_per_query` if `step` query arg passed to [/api/v1/query_range](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries) is smaller than the lookbehind window set in square brackets of [rollup function](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rollup-functions). For example, if `increase(some_metric[1h])` is executed with the `step=5m`, then the same raw samples on a hour time range are scanned `1h/5m=12` times. See [this article](https://valyala.medium.com/how-to-optimize-promql-and-metricsql-queries-85a1b75bf986) for details.\r\n  * `vm_rows_read_per_series` - the number of raw samples read per queried series.\r\n  * `vm_series_read_per_query` - the number of series read per query.\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: publish binaries for FreeBSD and OpenBSD at [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): allow selecting the needed columns at table view. This functionaly may help when the selected time series contain many different labels. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2817) and [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2867).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: consistently name binaries at [releases page](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases) in the form `$(APP_NAME)-$(GOOS)-$(GOARCH)-$(VERSION).tar.gz`. For example, `victoria-metrics-linux-amd64-v1.79.0.tar.gz`. Previously the `$(GOOS)` part was missing in binaries for Linux.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): allow using `__name__` label (aka [metric name](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors)) in alerting annotations. For example:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n{{ $labels.__name__ }}: Too high connection number for \"{{ $labels.instance }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: limit max memory occupied by the cache, which stores parsed regular expressions. Previously too long regular expressions passed in [MetricsQL queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) could result in big amounts of used memory (e.g. multiple of gigabytes). Now the max cache size for parsed regexps is limited to a a few megabytes.\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly handle partial counter resets when calculating [rate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rate), [irate](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#irate) and [increase](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#increase) functions. Previously these functions could return zero values after partial counter resets until the counter increases to the last value before partial counter reset. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2787).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly calculate [histogram_quantile](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#histogram_quantile) over Prometheus buckets with unexpected values. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2819).\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): properly evaluate [timezone_offset](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#timezone_offset) function over time range covering time zone offset switches. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2771).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly add service-level labels (`__meta_kubernetes_service_*`) to discovered targets for `role: endpointslice` in [kubernetes_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config). Previously these labels were missing. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2823).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): make sure that [stale markers](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) are generated with the actual timestamp when unsuccessful scrape occurs. This should prevent from possible time series overlap on scrape target restart in dynmaic envirnoments such as Kubernetes.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly reload changed `-promscrape.config` file when `-promscrape.configCheckInterval` option is set. The changed config file wasn't reloaded in this case since [v1.69.0](#v1690). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2786). Thanks to @ttyv for the fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly set `Host` header during target scraping when `proxy_url` is set to http proxy. Previously the `Host` header was set to the proxy hostname instead of the target hostname. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2794).\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): assume that the response is complete if `-search.denyPartialResponse` is enabled and up to `-replicationFactor - 1` `vmstorage` nodes are unavailable. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1767).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmselect](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmselect): update `vm_partial_results_total` metric labels to be consistent with `vm_requests_total` labels.\r\n* BUGFIX: accept tags without values when reading data in [DataDog format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent). Thanks to @PerGon for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2839).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): properly pass the end of the selected time range to `time` query arg to [/api/v1/query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-queries) when displaying the requested data in JSON and table views. Previously the `time` query arg wasn't set, so `/api/v1/query` was always returning query results for the current time regardless of the selected time range. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2781).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): allow clicking on the suggestion from autocomplete list. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2804).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): apply the selected time range in date picker only after clicking the `Apply` button. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2811).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-07-14T13:16:17Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "3.3.3", "tag_name": "v3.3.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/v3.3.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx", "body": "### Linux\n\n```shell\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v3.3.3/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv \nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n```shell\ncurl -L  https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v3.3.3/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n## Changes\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* make commit sha from main (osamamagdy)\n", "created_at": "2022-07-14T00:38:37Z", "project": "JenkinsX", "repo": "jenkins-x/jx", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.12.3", "tag_name": "v1.12.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.12.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul", "body": "## 1.12.3 (July 13 2022)\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* Support Vault namespaces in Connect CA by adding RootPKINamespace and\nIntermediatePKINamespace fields to the config.

another maintenance release focused on code, tests and build refactoring along with some critical bug fixes and user enhancements.  This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.3.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 1.0.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.3.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 1.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.6.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.7.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.9.0 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 2.0.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.5.1 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.10 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* CNCF infra migration (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3511)\r\n* Fixed imagePullSecrets error for jiva helm chart\r\n* enforce quotas for hostpath with an ext4 filesystem for LocalPV Hostpath\r\n* enhanced the NDM to include path filter for custom udev rules.\r\n* add logs in cstor for better debuggability\r\n* added rate limiter to reduce log flood issue in LocalPV LVM\r\n* updated the csidriver CRD to v1 version for LocalPV device\r\n* fixed BDD failure for LocalPV Device\r\n* refactored LVM LocalPV to use dynamic client\r\n* arm64 infra support for Mayastor\r\n* fixed the default scheduler for LVM LocalPV\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @cxfcxf (Xuefeng Chen) for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/adopters/magnite/README.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

It helps in environments that\r\n   have many streams.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4950](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4950)\r\n\r\n * Optimization: internal message GUID is no longer generated for quorum queues and streams, as they\r\n   are specific to classic queues.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4990](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4990)\r\n\r\n * Two more AMQP 1.0 connection lifecycle events are now logged.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4982](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4982)\r\n\r\n * CRC32 checksum verification now can be disabled for quorum queues:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   quorum_queue.compute_checksums = false\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   This may be beneficial in environments that messages are large and CPU resources\r\n   are limited. Note the CRC32 checksums are not the only data corruption detection\r\n   mechanism used by quorum queues but they are good at catching certain types of corruption.\r\n\r\n   Disabling checksums can provide quorum queue throughput boost of up to 15%.\r\n   In environments where message size is small the gains will be smaller.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5166](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5166)\r\n\r\n * TLS configuration for inter-node stream replication connections now can\r\n   use function references and definitions.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4991](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4991)\r\n\r\n * Stream protocol connection logging is now less verbose.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5037](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5037)\r\n\r\n * Max stream segment size is now limited to 3 GiB to avoid a potential stream position overflow.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5020](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5020)\r\n\r\n * Stream coordinator warnings now include operation name for clarify.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5036](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5036)\r\n\r\n * Logging messages that use microseconds now use \"us\" for the SI symbol to be compatible with more\r\n   tools.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5125](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5125)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Channels on connections to mixed clusters that had 3.8 nodes in them could run into\r\n   an exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5141](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5141)\r\n\r\n * Inter-node cluster link statistics did not have any data when TLS was enabled for them.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4981](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4981)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues now correctly propagate errors when a `basic.get` (polling consumption) operation hits\r\n   a timeout.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by Ayanda @Ayanda-D Dube.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5107](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5107)\r\n\r\n * Stream consumer that used AMQP 0-9-1 instead of a stream protocol client, and disconnected,\r\n   leaked a file handle.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5085](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5085)\r\n\r\n * Max frame size and client heartbeat parameters for [RabbitMQ stream]() clients were not correctly\r\n   set when taken from `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5131](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5131)\r\n\r\n * Removed a duplicate exchange decorator set operation.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by P\u00e9ter @gomoripeti G\u00f6m\u00f6ri.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4962](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4962)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Consistent Hashing Exchange Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Node restarts could result in a hashing ring inconsistency.\r\n\r\n   This required a **potentially breaking change**: this exchange type\r\n   now only allows for **one binding between an exchange and a queue** (or another exchange).\r\n   All subsequent binding operations between them will be ignored, so \"first write wins\".\r\n\r\n   This is a natural topology for this plugin, and enforcing it helps avoid a set of\r\n   potential issues with concurrent node restarts and client operations that affect\r\n   consistent hash ring state.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3386](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3386)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Consul peer discovery now supports client-side TLS options, much like its Kubernetes and etcd peers.\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   cluster_formation.consul.scheme = https\r\n   # this assumes that Consul uses port 8501 for HTTPS clients\r\n   cluster_formation.consul.port = 8501\r\n\r\n   cluster_formation.consul.ssl_options.cacertfile = /path/to/consul/generated/ca_certificate.pem\r\n   cluster_formation.consul.ssl_options.certfile = /path/to/client/certificate.pem\r\n   cluster_formation.consul.ssl_options.keyfile = /path/to/client/client_key.pem\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5116](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/5116)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n *  `ra` upgraded from [`2.0.13` to

Please see https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/deprecating-projects-or-how-i-learned-to-love-apps/40888 for more information.\r\n\r\n  Since the initial version of Waypoint, the product has supported the ability to configure multiple apps within a single waypoint.hcl file. This functionality is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. The vast majority of users are not using this functionality and it served mostly as a source of confusion for users. For users who are using a monorepo pattern, we plan to add better workflows for you.\r\n\r\n  With a waypoint.hcl now focused on the configuration of a single application, the concept of a project within the Waypoint data model will be removed, moving applications to the top level. This is already how users talk about using Waypoint and we are confident that it will improve the overall understanding of Waypoint as well.\r\n\r\n  If you have questions about this change in functionality, we invite you to discuss with us at https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/deprecating-projects-or-how-i-learned-to-love-apps/40888 or https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues.\r\n  \r\n  [[GH-3466](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/pull/3466)]\r\n\r\nBUG FIXES:\r\n\r\n* cli: fix git dirty check that was broken for some versions of the git cli [[GH-3432](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/3432)]\r\n* cli: fix panic when running status report on app with zero prior deployments [[GH-3425](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/3425)]\r\n* core: Fix a rare panic when generating an invite token.

With the Ketama hashring, replication is currently handled by choosing subsequent nodes in the list of endpoints. This can lead to existing nodes getting more series when the hashring is scaled. This change makes replication to choose subsequent nodes from the hashring which should not create new series in old nodes when the hashring is scaled. Ketama hashring can be used by setting `--receive.hashrings-algorithm=ketama`.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#5337](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5337) Thanos Object Store: Add the `prefix` option to buckets.\r\n- [#5409](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5409) S3: Add option to force DNS style lookup.\r\n- [#5352](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5352) Cache: Add cache metrics to groupcache: `thanos_cache_groupcache_bytes`, `thanos_cache_groupcache_evictions_total`, `thanos_cache_groupcache_items` and `thanos_cache_groupcache_max_bytes`.\r\n- [#5391](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5391) Receive: Add relabeling support with the flag `--receive.relabel-config-file` or alternatively `--receive.relabel-config`.\r\n- [#5408](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5408) Receive: Add support for consistent hashrings.

This can be resolved by restarting VTOrc.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n### Gen4 is now the default planner\r\n\r\nThe new planner has been in the works since end of 2020, and it's finally grown enough to be able to become the default planner for Vitess.\r\nThis means that many more queries are supported on sharded keyspaces, and old queries might get planned better than before. \r\nYou can always roll back to the earlier planner, either by providing the flag `--planner-version=V3` to `vtgate`, or by adding a comment to individual queries, like so:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect /*vt+ PLANNER=V3 */ name, count(*) from users\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Schema Tracking is no longer experimental\r\n\r\nSchema tracking is now GA. It is enabled by default. Schema tracking allows the Gen4 planner to plan many more queries.\r\nThis can be turned off if necessary by changing the [relevant flags](https://vitess.io/docs/14.0/reference/features/schema-tracking/) on VTGate and VTTablet.\r\n\r\n### New query support\r\n\r\n#### Support for aggregation across shards\r\nVitess can now plan and execute most aggregation queries across multiple shards and/or keyspaces.\r\n\r\n#### INSERT from SELECT\r\nSupport has been added for inserting new data from SELECT queries.\r\nNow you can insert data from a query into a table using a query like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ninsert into tbl (col) select id from users \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### UPDATE from SELECT\r\nSimilarly, we have added support for UPDATE with scalar sub-queries. This allows for queries where the updated value is fetched using a subquery, such as this example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nupdate tbl set foo = (select count(*) from otherTbl)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command-line syntax deprecations\r\n\r\nVitess has begun a transition to a new library for CLI flag parsing.\r\nIn order to facilitate a smooth transition, certain syntaxes that will not be supported in the future now issue deprecation warnings when used.\r\n\r\nThe messages you will likely see, along with explanations and migrations, are:\r\n\r\n#### \"Use of single-dash long flags is deprecated\"\r\n\r\nSingle-dash usage will be only possible for short flags (e.g. `-v` is okay, but `-verbose` is not).\r\n\r\nTo migrate, update your CLI scripts from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vttablet -tablet_alias zone1-100 -init_keyspace mykeyspace ... # old way\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vttablet --tablet_alias zone1-100 --init_keyspace mykeyspace ... # new way\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### \"Detected a dashed argument after a position argument.\"\r\n\r\nAs the full deprecation text goes on to (attempt to) explain, mixing flags and positional arguments will change in a future version that will break scripts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when invoking a binary like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vtctl --topo_implementation etcd2 AddCellInfo --root \"/vitess/global\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything after the `AddCellInfo` is treated by `package flag` as a positional argument, and we then use a sub FlagSet to parse flags specific to the subcommand.\r\nSo, at the top-level, `flag.Args()` returns `[\"AddCellInfo\", \"--root\", \"/vitess/global\"]`.\r\n\r\nThe library we are transitioning to is more flexible, allowing flags and positional arguments to be interwoven on the command-line.\r\nFor the above example, this means that we would attempt to parse `--root` as a top-level flag for the `VTCtl` binary.\r\nThis will cause the program to exit on error, because that flag is only defined on the `AddCellInfo` subcommand.\r\n\r\nIn order to transition, a standalone double-dash (literally, `--`) will cause the new flag library to treat everything following that as a positional argument, and also works with the current flag parsing code we use.\r\n\r\nSo, to transition the above example without breakage, update the command to:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctl --topo_implementation etcd2 AddCellInfo -- --root \"/vitess/global\"\r\n$ # the following will also work\r\n$ vtctl --topo_implementation etcd2 -- AddCellInfo --root \"/vitess/global\"\r\n$ # the following will NOT work, because --topo_implementation is a top-level flag, not a sub-command flag\r\n$ vtctl -- --topo_implementation etcd2 AddCellInfo --root \"/vitess/global\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### vttablet --heartbeat_on_demand_duration\r\n\r\n`--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` joins the already existing heartbeat flags `--heartbeat_enable` and `--heartbeat_interval` and adds new behavior to heartbeat writes.\r\n\r\n`--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` takes a duration value, such as `5s`.\r\n\r\nThe default value for `--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` is zero, which means the flag is not set and there is no change in behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen `--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` has a positive value, then heartbeats are only injected on demand, based on internal requests. For example, when `--heartbeat_on_demand_duration=5s`, the tablet starts without injecting heartbeats.\r\nAn internal module, like the lag throttler, may request the heartbeat writer for heartbeats. Starting at that point in time, and for the duration (a lease) of `5s` in our example, the tablet will write heartbeats.\r\nIf no other requests come in during that time, the tablet then ceases to write heartbeats. If more requests for heartbeats come in, the tablet extends the lease for the next `5s` following each request.\r\nIt stops writing heartbeats `5s` after the last request is received.\r\n\r\nThe heartbeats are generated according to `--heartbeat_interval`.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecation of --online_ddl_check_interval\r\n\r\nThe flag `--online_ddl_check_interval` is deprecated and will be removed in `v15`. It has been unused in `v13`.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of --gateway_implementation\r\n\r\nIn previous releases, the `discoverygateway` was deprecated. In Vitess 14 it is now entirely removed, along with the VTGate flag that allowed us to choose a gateway.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecation of --planner_version\r\n\r\nThe flag `--planner_version` is deprecated and will be removed in `v15`. \r\nSome binaries used `--planner_version`, and some used `--planner-version`. \r\nThis has been made consistent - all binaries that allow you to configure the planner now take `--planner-version`.\r\nAll uses of the underscore form have been deprecated and will be removed in `v15`. \r\n\r\n### Online DDL changes\r\n\r\n#### Online DDL is generally available\r\n\r\nOnline DDL is no longer experimental (with the exception of `pt-osc` strategy). Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Managed schema changes, the scheduler, the backing tables\r\n- Supporting SQL syntax\r\n- `vitess` strategy (online DDL via VReplication)\r\n- `gh-ost` strategy (online DDL via 3rd party `gh-ost`)\r\n- Recoverable migrations\r\n- Revertible migrations\r\n- Declarative migrations\r\n- Postponed migrations\r\n- And all other functionality\r\n\r\nAre all considered production-ready.\r\n\r\n`pt-osc` strategy (online DDL via 3rd party `pt-online-schema-change`) remains experimental.\r\n\r\n#### ddl_strategy: 'vitess'\r\n\r\n`ddl_strategy` now takes the value of `vitess` to indicate VReplication-based migrations. It is a synonym to `online` and uses the exact same functionality. The `online` term will be phased out in the future and `vitess` will remain the term of preference.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nvtctlclient ApplySchema -skip_preflight -ddl_strategy='vitess' -sql \"alter table my_table add column my_val int not null default 0\" commerce\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### --singleton-context and REVERT migrations\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to submit a migration with `--singleton-context` strategy flag, while there's a pending (queued or running) `REVERT` migration that does not have a `--singleton-context` flag.\r\n\r\n#### Support for CHECK constraints\r\n\r\nOnline DDL operations are more aware of `CHECK` constraints, and properly handle the limitation where a `CHECK`'s name has to be unique in the schema. As opposed to letting MySQL choose arbitrary names for shadow table's `CHECK` constraints, Online DDL now generates unique yet deterministic names, such that all shards converge onto the same names.\r\n\r\nOnline DDL attempts to preserve the original check's name as a suffix to the generated name, where possible (names are limited to `64` characters).\r\n\r\n#### Behavior changes\r\n\r\n- `vtctl ApplySchema --uuid_list='...'` now rejects a migration if an existing migration has the same UUID but with different `migration_context`.\r\n\r\n### Table lifecycle\r\n\r\n#### Views\r\n\r\nTable lifecycle now supports views. It does not purge rows from views, and does not keep views in `EVAC` state (they are immediately transitioned to `DROP` state).\r\n\r\n#### Fast drops\r\n\r\nOn Mysql `8.0.23` or later, the states `PURGE` and `EVAC` are automatically skipped, thanks to `8.0.23` improvements to `DROP TABLE` speed of operation.\r\n\r\n### Tablet throttler\r\n\r\n#### API changes\r\n\r\nAdded `/throttler/throttled-apps` endpoint, which reports back all current throttling instructions. Note, this only reports explicit throttling requests (such as ones submitted by `/throtler/throttle-app?app=...`). It does not list incidental rejections based on throttle thresholds.\r\n\r\nAPI endpoint `/throttler/throttle-app` now accepts a `ratio` query argument, a floating point value in the range `[0..1]`, where:\r\n\r\n- `0` means \"do not throttle at all\"\r\n- `1` means \"always throttle\"\r\n- Any number in between is allowed. For example, `0.3` means \"throttle with 0.3 probability\", i.e. for any given request there's a 30% chance that the request is denied. Overall we can expect about `30%` of requests to be denied. Example: `/throttler/throttle-app?app=vreplication&ratio=0.25`.\r\n\r\nSee new SQL syntax for controlling/viewing throttling, under [New Syntax](#new-syntax).\r\n\r\n#### New Syntax\r\n\r\n##### Control and view Online DDL throttling\r\n\r\nWe introduce the following syntax to:\r\n\r\n- Start/stop throttling for all Online DDL migrations, in general\r\n- Start/stop throttling for a particular Online DDL migration\r\n- View throttler state\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '<uuid>' THROTTLE [EXPIRE '<duration>'] [RATIO <ratio>];\r\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION THROTTLE ALL [EXPIRE '<duration>'] [RATIO <ratio>];\r\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '<uuid>' UNTHROTTLE;\r\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION UNTHROTTLE ALL;\r\nSHOW VITESS_THROTTLED_APPS;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default `duration` is \"infinite\" (set as 100 years):\r\n- Allowed units are (s)ec, (m)in, (h)our\r\n\r\nThe ratio is in the range `[0..1]`:\r\n- `1` means throttle everything - the app will not make any progress\r\n- `0` means no throttling at all\r\n- `0.8` means on 8 out of 10 checks the app makes, it gets refused\r\n\r\nThe syntax `SHOW VITESS_THROTTLED_APPS` is a generic call to the throttler, and returns information about all throttled apps, not specific to migrations.\r\n\r\nThe output of `SHOW VITESS_MIGRATIONS ...` now includes `user_throttle_ratio`.\r\n\r\nThis column is updated \"once in a while\", while a migration is running. Normally this is once a minute, but can be more frequent. The migration reports back the throttling instruction set by the user while it was running.\r\nThis column does not indicate any lag-based throttling that might take place based on the throttler configuration. It only reports the explicit throttling value set by the user.\r\n\r\n### Heartbeat\r\n\r\nThe throttler now checks in with the heartbeat writer to request heartbeats, any time it (the throttler) is asked for a check.\r\n\r\nWhen `--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` is not set, there is no change in behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen `--heartbeat_on_demand_duration` is set to a positive value, then the throttler ensures that the heartbeat writer generates heartbeats for at least the following duration.\r\nThis also means at the first throttler check, it's possible that heartbeats are idle, and so the first check will fail. As heartbeats start running, followup checks will get a more accurate lag evaluation and will respond accordingly.\r\nIn a sense, it's a \"cold engine\" scenario, where the engine takes time to start up, and then runs smoothly.\r\n\r\n### VDiff2\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new version of VDiff -- currently marked as EXPERIMENTAL -- that executes the VDiff on vttablets rather than in vtctld.\r\nWhile this is experimental we encourage you to try it out and provide feedback! This input will be invaluable as we improve the feature on the march toward [a production-ready version](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/10494).\r\nYou can try it out by adding the `--v2` flag to your VDiff command. Here's an example:\r\n```\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer\r\nVDiff bf9dfc5f-e5e6-11ec-823d-0aa62e50dd24 scheduled on target shards, use show to view progress\r\n\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 customer.commerce2customer show last\r\n\r\nVDiff Summary for customer.commerce2customer (4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0)\r\nState:        completed\r\nRowsCompared: 196\r\nHasMismatch:  false\r\nStartedAt:    2022-06-26 22:44:29\r\nCompletedAt:  2022-06-26 22:44:31\r\n\r\nUse \"--format=json\" for more detailed output.\r\n\r\n$ vtctlclient --server=localhost:15999 VDiff -- --v2 --format=json customer.commerce2customer show last\r\n{\r\n\t\"Workflow\": \"commerce2customer\",\r\n\t\"Keyspace\": \"customer\",\r\n\t\"State\": \"completed\",\r\n\t\"UUID\": \"4c664dc2-eba9-11ec-9ef7-920702940ee0\",\r\n\t\"RowsCompared\": 196,\r\n\t\"HasMismatch\": false,\r\n\t\"Shards\": \"0\",\r\n\t\"StartedAt\": \"2022-06-26 22:44:29\",\r\n\t\"CompletedAt\": \"2022-06-26 22:44:31\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Even before it's marked as production-ready (feature complete and tested widely in 1+ releases), it should be safe to use and is likely to provide much better results for very large tables.\r\n\r\nFor additional details please see the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/10134), the [README](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/release-14.0/go/vt/vttablet/tabletmanager/vdiff/README.md), and the VDiff2 [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/14.0/reference/vreplication/vdiff2/).\r\n\r\n### Durability Policy\r\n\r\n#### Deprecation of durability_policy Flag\r\nThe durability policy for a keyspace is now stored in the keyspace record in the topology server.\r\nThe `durability_policy` flag used by VTCtl, VTCtld, and VTWorker binaries has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### New and Augmented Commands\r\nThe VTCtld command `CreateKeyspace` has been augmented to take in an additional argument `--durability-policy` which will\r\nallow users to set the desired durability policy for a keyspace at creation time.\r\n\r\nFor existing keyspaces, a new command `SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy` has been added, which allows users to change the\r\ndurability policy of an existing keyspace.\r\n\r\nIf semi-sync is not being used then durability policy should be set to `none` for the keyspace. This is also the default option.\r\n\r\nIf semi-sync is being used then durability policy should be set to `semi_sync` for the keyspace and `--enable_semi_sync` should be set on vttablets.\r\n\r\n### VTOrc - Deprecation of Durability Configuration\r\nThe `Durability` configuration is deprecated and removed from VTOrc. Instead VTOrc will find the durability policy of the keyspace from\r\nthe topology server. This allows VTOrc to monitor and repair multiple keyspaces which have different durability policies in use.\r\n\r\n**VTOrc will ignore keyspaces which have no durability policy specified in the keyspace record. This is to avoid clobbering an existing\r\nconfig from a previous release. So on upgrading to v14, users must run the command `SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy` specified above,\r\nto ensure that VTOrc continues to work as desired. The recommended upgrade\r\npath is to upgrade VTCtld, run `SetKeyspaceDurabilityPolicy` and then upgrade VTOrc.**\r\n\r\n### Advisory locking optimizations\r\nWork has gone into making the advisory locks (`get_lock()`, `release_lock()`, etc.) release reserved connections faster and in more situations than before.\r\n\r\n### Pre-Legacy Resharding is now deprecated\r\nA long time ago, the sharding column and type were specified at the keyspace level. This syntax is now deprecated and will be removed in v15.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/doc/releasenotes/14_0_0_changelog.md).\r\n\r\nThe release includes 1101 commits (excluding merges)\r\n\r\nThanks to all our contributors: @FancyFane, @GuptaManan100, @Juneezee, @K-Kumar-01, @Phanatic, @ajm188, @akenneth, @aquarapid, @arthurschreiber, @brendar, @cuishuang, @dasl-, @dbussink, @deepthi, @dependabot[bot], @derekperkins, @doeg, @fatih, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @malpani, @matthiasr, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @notfelineit, @pjambet, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rsajwani, @shlomi-noach, @simon-engledew, @systay, @utk9, @vmg, @vmogilev, @y5w, @yields\r\n", "created_at": "2022-06-28T17:27:21Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "REL_15_BETA2", "html_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/c1d033fcb5ecf306241cd729d1edcaa846456335", "repo_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres", "body": "Stamp 15beta2.", "created_at": "2022-06-27T20:11:56Z", "project": "Postgres", "repo": "postgres/postgres", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.3.8", "tag_name": "v3.3.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/tag/v3.3.8", "repo_url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo", "body": "# Quick Start\n\n## What's New?\n\nFind out on [our blog](https://blog.argoproj.io) and [changelog](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Breaking Changes and Known Issues\n\nSee [upgrading](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/docs/upgrading.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n### CLI\n\n#### Mac\n\nAvailable via `curl`\n\n```sh\n# Download the binary\ncurl -sLO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.3.8/argo-darwin-amd64.gz\n\n# Unzip\ngunzip argo-darwin-amd64.gz\n\n# Make binary executable\nchmod +x argo-darwin-amd64\n\n# Move binary to path\nmv ./argo-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argo\n\n# Test installation\nargo version\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\nAvailable via `curl`\n\n```sh\n# Download the binary\ncurl -sLO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.3.8/argo-linux-amd64.gz\n\n# Unzip\ngunzip argo-linux-amd64.gz\n\n# Make binary executable\nchmod +x argo-linux-amd64\n\n# Move binary to path\nmv ./argo-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argo\n\n# Test installation\nargo version\n```\n\n### Controller and Server\n\n```sh\nkubectl create namespace argo\nkubectl apply -n argo -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/download/v3.3.8/install.yaml\n```\n", "created_at": "2022-06-23T21:13:51Z", "project": "Argo", "repo": "argoproj/argo", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v17.2.1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ceph/ceph/commits/ec95624474b1871a821a912b8c3af68f8f8e7aa1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ceph/ceph", "body": "17.2.1\n\nSigned-off-by: Ceph Release Team <ceph-maintainers@ceph.io>", "created_at": "2022-06-23T14:41:35Z", "project": "Ceph", "repo": "ceph/ceph", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.26.0", "tag_name": "v1.26.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.26.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

After upgrading from 1.2.x, all v1beta1 resources will be converted to v1beta2 and v1beta1 resources are still accessible by the conversion webhook.\r\n- The communication between longhorn manager and engine processes in each instance manager has been changed. It will be proxied through instance manager to support network segregation when adopting storage network. This change will not impact any existing volume operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n  \r\n  - [FEATURE] Clean up orphaned unused volume replicas ([685](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/685)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n  - [FEATURE] Longhorn CRD Structural Schema, v1beta2 API ([791](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/791)) - @kaxing @jenting\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS) ([1800](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1800)) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] instance-manager compatibility with Cluster Autoscaler ([2203](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2203)) - @kaxing @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support multi-network K8s clusters (storage network) ([2285](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2285)) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Extend CSI Snapshot support to Longhorn snapshot ([2534](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2534)) - @PhanLe1010 @cchien816\r\n  - [BUG] helm upgrade won't apply customize default setting ([2570](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2570)) - @derekbit @cchien816\r\n  - [FEATURE] Introduce SUSE BCI based component images ([2939](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2939)) - @meldafrawi\r\n  - [FEATURE] Snapshot CRD ([3144](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3144)) - @PhanLe1010 @cchien816\r\n  - [FEATURE] Download backing images ([3155](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3155)) - @yangchiu @shuo-wu\r\n  - [FEATURE] Mutating and Validating admission webhook ([3241](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3241)) - @kaxing @jenting\r\n  - [FEATURE]   CRD version webhook for longhorn.io/v1beta1 and longhorn.io/v1beta2 ([3265](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3265)) - @kaxing @derekbit @jenting\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support s390x IBM Z ([3425](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3425)) - @Anarkis @thehejik\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support operations on custom resources directly instead of Longhorn REST APIs only ([3562](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3562)) - @kaxing @derekbit\r\n  - [IMPROVEMENT] Improve snapshot purge ([3613](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3613)) - @yangchiu @shuo-wu\r\n  - [FEATURE] mTLS authentication for manager <-> instance-manager communication ([3839](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3839)) - @joshimoo @cchien816\r\n  \r\n## Enhancements\r\n  \r\n  - [FEATURE] Include a NetworkPolicy to secure communication inside of Longhorn ([1805](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1805)) - @kaxing @PhanLe1010\r\n  - [BUG] Remove hard-coded namespace in uninstall controller ([2034](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2034)) - @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Allow use of existing private registry secret ([2157](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2157)) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Recurring snapshot/backup job supports imagePullSecrets ([2432](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2432)) - @kaxing @jenting\r\n  - [IMPROVEMENT] Support Filesystem expansion for encrypted volumes ([2868](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2868)) - @joshimoo @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] podAntiAffinity for csi-attacher/csi-provisioner/csi-resizer/csi-snapshotter ([2894](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2894)) - @kaxing @derekbit\r\n  - [FEATURE] Prometheus metrics for backups ([2940](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2940)) - @meldafrawi\r\n  - [FEATURE] Match type of status.conditions of nodes.longhorn.io to other k8s objects ([2955](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2955)) - @derekbit @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [TASK] Publish Longhorn stable releases ([3014](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3014)) - @PhanLe1010 @smallteeths @cchien816\r\n  - [FEATURE] Expect LH has a lightweight solution for volume failure like \"insufficient storage\" ([3734](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3734)) - @PhanLe1010\r\n  - [FEATURE] Longhorn UI supports orphan CRs management ([3826](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3826)) - @yangchiu @derekbit @smallteeths\r\n  - [FEATURE] Make Longhorn UI Listen Binding configurable ([3829](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3829)) - @yangchiu @smallteeths\r\n  \r\n## Improvement\r\n  \r\n  - [IMPROVEMENT] refactor engine-image-controller to use structured logging ([1726](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1726)) - @jenting\r\n  - [IMPROVEMENT] Change the lifecycle management of the instance-manager pods.

of `docker load`.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command could panic if the `--log-opt` option was used ([#13356](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13356)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, under some circumstances, fail to parse container cgroup paths ([#14146](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14146)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with the `--sdnotify=conmon` option could send `MAINPID` twice.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command could fail when run inside an LXC container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the pause image of a Pod with a custom ID mappings could not be built ([BZ 2083997](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083997)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where, on `podman machine` VMs on Windows, containers could be prematurely terminated with API forwarding was not running ([#13965](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13965)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where removing a container with a zombie exec session would fail the first time, but succeed for subsequent calls ([#14252](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14252)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a dangling ID in the database could render Podman unusable.\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers with memory limits could not be created when Podman was run in a root cgroup ([#14236](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14236)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--security-opt` option to `podman run` and `podman create` did not support the `no-new-privileges:true` and `no-new-privileges:false` options (the only supported separator was `=`, not `:`) ([#14133](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14133)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers that did not create a network namespace (e.g. containers created with `--network none` or `--network ns:/path/to/ns`) could not be restored from checkpoints ([#14389](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14389)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman-restart.service` could, if enabled, cause system shutdown to hang for 90 seconds ([#14434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14434)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would, when run as root on a container that had the `podman network disconnect` command run on it or that set a custom network interface name, return an error ([#13824](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13824)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman pod create` command would error when the `--uidmap` option was used ([#14233](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14233)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where cleaning up systemd units and timers related to healthchecks was subject to race conditions and could fail.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the default network mode of containers created by the remote Podman client was assigned by the client, not the server ([#14368](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14368)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers joining a pod that was created with `--network=host` would receive a private network namespace ([#13763](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13763)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine rm --force` would remove files related to the VM before stopping it, causing issues if removal was interrupted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman logs` would omit the last line of a container's logs if the log did not end in a newline ([#14458](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14458)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where network cleanup was nonfunctional for containers which used a custom user namespace and were initialized via API ([#14465](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14465)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some options (including volumes) for containers that joined pods were overwritten by the infra container ([#14454](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14454)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--file-locks` option to `podman container restore` was ignored, such that file locks checkpointed by `podman container checkpoint --file-locks` were not restored.\r\n- Fixed a bug where signals sent to a Podman attach session with `--sig-proxy` enabled at the exact moment the container that was attached to exited could cause error messages to be printed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where running the `podman machine start` command more than once (simultaneously) on the same machine would cause errors.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command could not be run on containers that were not running (it now reports all-0s statistics for Docker compatibility) ([#14498](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14498)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where images pulled from a private registry could not be accessed via shortname using the Compat API endpoints ([#14291](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14291)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Delete API for Images would return an incorrect status code (500) when attempting to delete images that are in use ([#14208](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14208)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build API for Images would include the build's `STDERR` output even if the `quiet` parameter was true.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Play Kube API would overwrite any log driver specified by query parameter with the system default.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command now creates an event when it is run.\r\n- Error messages printed when Podman's temporary files directory is not writable have been improved.\r\n- Units for memory limits accepted by Podman commands were incorrectly stated by documentation as megabytes, instead of mebibytes; this has now been corrected ([#14187](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14187)).\r\n",

This allows an admin to specify which cgroup the monitor for exec sync requests runs in (defaults to that of CRI-O). ([#5837](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5837), [@donpenney](https://github.com/donpenney))\r\n - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information.

If you are already using encrypting secret a rest and have not set the `kube_encryption_algorithm` flag, then you must set `kube_encryption_algorithm` to `aescbc` since the default value has changed to the more secure `secretbox` standard.\r\n3. `etcd_kubeadm_enabled` is deprecated. You can set `etcd_deployment_type` to `kubeadm` to get the same behaviour.\"\r\n4. This add some variables that could be defined by the user. It doesn't introduce a breaking change because the previous unique variable (kube_feature_gates) still works as expected, new variables are: kube_apiserver_feature_gates/kube_controller_feature_gates/kube_scheduler_feature_gates/kube_proxy_feature_gates/kubelet_feature_gates\r\n5. Be careful as the port has now moved to 4443\r\n6. To use it, adjust `contrib/terraform/openstack/modules/compute/templates/cloudinit.yaml` before deployment. (Currently it uses one cloud init for all instances.)\r\n7. `containerd_insecure_registries` needs to be updated or won't work anymore!\r\n8. Update the configuration of cri-o registries to only use the crio_registries key\r\n9.

some non-systemd-based hosts such as WSL2 and Alpine based tools like colima and rancher-desktop. \r\n\r\nBesides the cgroups fix, the update to the latest version of the local-path-provisioner may be a desirable upgrade worth noting with various downstream improvements.\r\n\r\nBe sure to see [the previous release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.13.0) as well!\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\nNOTE: The systemd change is from KIND v0.13.0, but we're re-iterating it here since v0.13.0 was so recent.\r\n\r\n- **systemd cgroups driver will be used for Kubernetes v1.24.0+** (rather than 1.21.0+ when [kubeadm changed the default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99471), which we previously overrode).\r\n  - **NOTE**: **You must use kind v0.13.0+ with Kubernetes v1.24.0+ images**, and if you built your own Kubernetes v1.24.0+ image\r\nwith a previous kind version you will need to re-built when switching to kind v0.13.0+.\r\n  - **NOTE**: **You do not need to be using systemd on the host machine**, In kind v0.13.0 we had a bug related to this, it should be fixed this release. systemd is used *inside* the kind node containers but should not be necessary on the host. We are now using it for Kubernetes pods in addition to running kubelet, containerd etc.\r\n  - KIND will **continue to use cgroupfs for Kubernetes versions prior to v1.24.0**.\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.24.0` image: `kindest/node:v1.24.0@sha256:0866296e693efe1fed79d5e6c7af8df71fc73ae45e3679af05342239cdc5bc8e`\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- digest image references should be populated when loading images\r\n- base image updates\r\n  - crictl v1.24.0\r\n- kind binary built with Go 1.18.2\r\n- all kindnetd dependencies updated to latest\r\n- updated haproxy image\r\n- latest local-path-provisioner v0.0.22 with updated packaging\r\n- support for Kubernetes v1.25.0-alpha pre-releases builds without the old kubeadm node taint\r\n- updated cgroupsv2 CI to Fedora 36\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Node images have been built for kind `v0.14.0`, please use these **exact** images (IE like `kindest/node:v1.24.0@sha256:0866296e693efe1fed79d5e6c7af8df71fc73ae45e3679af05342239cdc5bc8e` including the digest) or build your own as we may need to change the image format again in the future :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\nImages built for this release:\r\n  - 1.24: `kindest/node:v1.24.0@sha256:0866296e693efe1fed79d5e6c7af8df71fc73ae45e3679af05342239cdc5bc8e`\r\n  - 1.23: `kindest/node:v1.23.6@sha256:b1fa224cc6c7ff32455e0b1fd9cbfd3d3bc87ecaa8fcb06961ed1afb3db0f9ae`\r\n  - 1.22: `kindest/node:v1.22.9@sha256:8135260b959dfe320206eb36b3aeda9cffcb262f4b44cda6b33f7bb73f453105`\r\n  - 1.21: `kindest/node:v1.21.12@sha256:f316b33dd88f8196379f38feb80545ef3ed44d9197dca1bfd48bcb1583210207`\r\n  - 1.20: `kindest/node:v1.20.15@sha256:6f2d011dffe182bad80b85f6c00e8ca9d86b5b8922cdf433d53575c4c5212248`\r\n  - 1.19: `kindest/node:v1.19.16@sha256:d9c819e8668de8d5030708e484a9fdff44d95ec4675d136ef0a0a584e587f65c`\r\n  - 1.18: `kindest/node:v1.18.20@sha256:738cdc23ed4be6cc0b7ea277a2ebcc454c8373d7d8fb991a7fcdbd126188e6d7`\r\n\r\nNOTE: these node images support amd64 and arm64.
