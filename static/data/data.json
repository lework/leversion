features, bugfixes, security fixes, optimizations and build updates related to\r\nOPA's published images.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Functions: JSON Schema Verification and Validation\r\n\r\nThese new built-in functions add functionality to verify and validate JSON Schema ([#5486](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5486)) (co-authored by @jkulvich and @johanfylling).\r\n\r\n- `json.verify_schema`: Checks that the input is a valid JSON schema object\r\n- `json.match_schema`: Checks that the document matches the JSON schema\r\n\r\nSee the [documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.50.0/policy-reference/#object) for all details.\r\n\r\n### Annotations scoped to `package` carries across modules\r\n\r\n`package` scoped schema annotations are now applied across modules instead of only local to the module where\r\nit's declared  ([#5251](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5251)) (authored by @johanfylling). This change may cause compile-time errors and behavioural changes to\r\ntype checking when the `schemas` annotation is used, and to rules calling the `rego.metadata.chain()` built-in function:\r\n\r\n  - Existing projects with the same package declared in multiple files will trigger a `rego_type_error: package annotation redeclared`\r\nerror _if_ two or more of these are annotated with the `package` scope.\r\n  - If using the `package` scope, the `schemas` annotation will be applied to type checking also for rules declared in\r\nanother file than the annotation declaration, as long as the package is the same.\r\n  - The chain of metadata returned by the `rego.metadata.chain()` built-in function will now contain an entry for the\r\npackage even if the annotations are declared in another file, if the scope is `package`.\r\n\r\n### Remote bundle URL shorthand for `run` command\r\n\r\nTo load a remote bundle using `opa run`, the `set` directive can be provided multiple times as shown below:\r\n```\r\n $ opa run -s --set \"services.default.url=https://example.com\" \\\r\n              --set \"bundles.example.service=default\" \\\r\n              --set \"bundles.example.resource=/bundles/bundle.tar.gz\" \\\r\n              --set \"bundles.example.persist=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following command can be used as a shorthand to easily start OPA with a remote bundle ([#5674](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5674)) (authored by @anderseknert):\r\n```\r\n$ opa run -s https://example.com/bundles/bundle.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Performance Improvements for `json.patch` Built-in Function\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements in `json.patch` were achieved with the introduction of a new `EditTree` data structure,\r\nwhich is built for applying in-place modifications to an `ast.Term`, and can render the final result of all edits efficiently\r\nby applying all patches in a JSON-Patch sequence rapidly, and then collapsing all edits at the end with minimal wasted `ast.Term` copying (authored by @philipaconrad).\r\nFor more details and benchmarks refer [#5494](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5494) and [#5390](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5390).\r\n\r\n### Surface decision log errors via status API\r\n\r\nErrors encountered during decision log uploads will now be surfaced via the Status API in addition to being logged. This\r\nfunctionality should give users greater visibility into any issues OPA may face while processing, uploading logs etc ([#5637](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5637)) (authored by @ashutosh-narkar).\r\n\r\nSee the [documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.50.0/management-status/#status-service-api) for more details.\r\n\r\n### OPA Published Images Update\r\n\r\nAll published OPA images now run with a non-root uid/gid. The `uid:gid` is set to `1000:1000` for all images. As a result\r\nthere is no longer a need for the `-rootless` image variant and hence it will be not be published as part of future releases.\r\nThis change is in line with container security best practices. OPA can still be run with root privileges by explicitly setting the user,\r\neither with the `--user` argument for `docker run`, or by specifying the `securityContext` in the Kubernetes Pod specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- server: Support compression of response payloads if HTTP client supports it ([#5310](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5310)) authored by @AdrianArnautu\r\n- bundle: Ensure the bundle resulting from merging a set of bundles does not contain `nil` data ([#5703](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5703))  authored by @anderseknert\r\n- repl: Use lowercase for repl commands only and keep any provided arguments as-is ([#5229](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5229)) authored by @Trolloldem\r\n- metrics: New endpoint `/metrics/alloc_bytes` to show OPA's memory utilization ([#5715](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5715)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- server: When using OPA TLS authorization, authz policy authors will now have access to the client certificates\r\npresented as part of the TLS connection. This new data will be available under the key `client_certificates` ([#5538](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5538))  authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- server: Use streaming implementation of json.Decode rather than using an intermediate buffer for the incoming request ([#5661](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5661)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Extend compiler `strict` mode check to include unused arguments ([#5602](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5602)) authored by @boranx.

This allows for\npull and push operations to be done in containerd whether requested from clients or plugins. It is experimental in this release\nto allow for further plugin development and integration into existing plugins.\n\nSee the [Transfer Docs](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/transfer.md)\n\n#### NRI _(experimental)_\n\n* **Extend NRI scope** ([nri#16](https://github.com/containerd/nri/pull/16))\n* **Support for updated NRI** ([#6019](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6019))\n\nThe Node Resource Interface is a common framework for plugging extensions into OCI-compatible container runtimes. It provides\nbasic mechanisms for plugins to track the state of containers and to make limited changes to their configuration.\n\nThis release introduces NRI v0.3.0 with an updated plugin interface to cover a wide range of use cases.\n\nSee the [NRI Docs](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/NRI.md)\n\n#### Platform Support\n\n* **Linux containers on FreeBSD** ([#7000](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7000))\n\n#### Runtime Features\n\n* **Add support for CDI device injection** ([#6654](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6654))\n* **Support for cgroups blockio** ([#5490](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5490))\n* **Add restart policy for enhanced restart manager** ([#6744](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6744))\n\n#### gRPC Shim Support _(experimental)_\n\n* **Initial gRPC shim support** ([#8052](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8052))\n\nAdds support for shims to use gRPC in addition to ttrpc. Existing ttrpc shim support is not going\naway and will continue to be recommended for the best performance and lowest shim memory overhead.\nThe gRPC support allows implementation of a wider range of shim implementations which may not\nhave access to a stable ttrpc library in the implementation language. The shim protocol is also\nupdated to allow the shims to specify the protocol which is supported.\n\n#### Road to 2.0\n\n##### Refactoring\n\nThere are multiple places in the code today which are being targeted for refactoring to make long term support easier and to provide more extension points.\n\nThe CRI plugin is the most complex containerd plugin with a wide range of functionality. A major effort in this release and before 2.0 involves moving functionality\nout of the single CRI plugin into smaller-scoped containerd plugins, such that they can be used and tested independently. The new sandbox and distribution interfaces provide one example of this,\nbut it also being done for image and network management.\n\nThe version of ttrpc has been updated this release to support streaming, allowing existing grpc services to use ttrpc.\nServices are being refactored to allow ttrpc implementations, which can be served via shim and accessed using the new sandbox management capability.\n\n* **Remove gogoproto.customtype** ([#6699](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6699))\n* **Remove enumvalue_customname, goproto_enum_prefix and enum_customname** ([#6708](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6708))\n* **Remove all gogoproto extensions** ([#6829](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6829))\n* **Migrate off from github.com/gogo/protobuf** ([#6841](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6841))\n* **ttrpc streaming** ([ttrpc#107](https://github.com/containerd/ttrpc/pull/107))\n* **Add unpack interface for client** ([#6749](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6749))\n* **Add collectible resources to metadata gc** ([#6804](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6804))\n* **Add version to shim protocol** ([#8177](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8177))\n\n##### Configuration\n\nExisting CRI configurations will be supported until 2.0.\nAny functionality split out of CRI will have their configuration migrated to new plugins.\nDeprecated configuration versions and configurations for deprecated features will be removed in 2.0.\n\n##### Deprecation\n\nThe 2.0 release will remove any feature deprecated in 1.x. Features deprecated in this release include.\n\n* **Docker Schema 1 Image Deprecation** ([#6884](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6884))\n\n#### CRI Updates\n\n* **Fix CRI plugin to setup pod network after creating the sandbox container** ([#5904](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5904))\n* **Support image pull progress timeout** ([#6150](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6150))\n* **Add experimental support for runtime specific snapshotters** ([#6899](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/6899))\n* **Pass all TOML runtime configuration options from CRI to the runtime** ([#7764](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7764))\n* **Support for user namespaces in stateless pods ([KEP-127](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces)) _(experimental)_** ([#7679](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7679))\n* **Add timeout option for drain exec io** ([#7832](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7832))\n* **Add network plugin metrics** ([#7858](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7858))\n* **CRI v1alpha2 is deprecated and will be removed from containerd in containerd v2.0; if you are using the CRI API please move up to CRI v1; Kubernetes supports CRI v1 since Kubernetes 1.23** ([#7863](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7863))\n\n#### Other\n\n* **Support shallow content copy by adding reader option to local content reader at** ([#7414](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7414))\n* **Add NoSameOwner option when unpacking tars** ([#7386](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7386))\n* **Add `FetcherByDigest` for fetching blobs without fetching a manifest** ([#7460](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7460))\n* **Update default seccomp profile to block socket calls to AF_VSOCK** ([#7510](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7510))\n* **Replace fork on mount logic with CLONE_FS** ([#7513](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7513))\n* **Add support for default registry host configuration** ([#7607](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7607))\n* **Use github.com/minio/sha256-simd for more efficient sha256 calculation** ([#7732](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7732))\n* **Make OCI options cross-platform** ([#7928](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7928))\n* **Update release builds to build from Ubuntu 20.04 with glibc 2.31** ([#8021](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8021))\n* **Use data field from OCI descriptor when provided for fetch** ([#8076](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8076))\n\nSee the changelog for complete list of changes\n\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\n\n### Contributors\n\n* Derek McGowan\n* Kazuyoshi Kato\n* Maksym Pavlenko\n* Wei Fu\n* Phil Estes\n* Akihiro Suda\n* Sebastiaan van Stijn\n* Samuel Karp\n* Krisztian Litkey\n* Mike Brown\n* Stefan Berger\n* Danny Canter\n* Austin Vazquez\n* Daniel Canter\n* yanggang\n* Iceber Gu\n* Ye Sijun\n* Ed Bartosh\n* Luca Comellini\n* Adam Korcz\n* Nashwan Azhari\n* Tony Fang\n* ruiwen-zhao\n* xin.li\n* Brian Goff\n* Gabriel Adrian Samfira\n* Paul \"TBBle\" Hampson\n* Henry Wang\n* Kevin Parsons\n* Rodrigo Campos\n* zounengren\n* Justin Terry\n* Paco Xu\n* Shengjing Zhu\n* Swagat Bora\n* wanglei\n* Gavin Inglis\n* Akhil Mohan\n* Hsing-Yu (David) Chen\n* Zechun Chen\n* guodong\n* lengrongfu\n* James Jenkins\n* James Sturtevant\n* Kirtana Ashok\n* Michael Crosby\n* Qiutong Song\n* Shiming Zhang\n* Vincent Batts\n* Antonio Ojea\n* Cameron Sparr\n* Casey Callendrello\n* Changwei Ge\n* Jian Zeng\n* Josh Seba\n* Junyu Liu\n* Kohei Tokunaga\n* Michael Zappa\n* Qasim Sarfraz\n* Tobias Klauser\n* Zhang Tianyang\n* pigletfly\n* yaoyinnan\n* Abirdcfly\n* Aditi Sharma\n* Amit Barve\n* Bennett-White\n* Bjorn Neergaard\n* Cory Snider\n* Craig Ingram\n* Eng Zer Jun\n* Eric Lin\n* Ethan Lowman\n* Fabian Hoffmann\n* Jess\n* Jiongchi Yu\n* Jonny Stoten\n* Juan Hoyos\n* Kang.Zhang\n* Kay Yan\n* Markus Lehtonen\n* Mikko Ylinen\n* Mohit Sharma\n* Paul Cacheux\n* Paul S.

The names of groups for existing clusters are unchanged.\r\n\r\n* The channels CLI that kOps use to manage addons is now bundled with the kOps binary. These commands are useful for addon diagnostics and troubleshooting. For example, to list installed addons, run `kops toolbox addons get addons`.\r\n\r\n* Since kOps 1.24, by default during rolling updates, kOps will time out after\r\nspending 15 minutes on an InstanceGroup (instead of hanging indefinitely on\r\neviction errors), proceeding to the next InstanceGroup after timing out.\r\nAs of kOps 1.26, rolling updates will not proceed if a cluster validation\r\nerror is encountered while updating an InstanceGroup.\r\n\r\n### AWS\r\n\r\n* Clusters can be created without DNS or Gossip, by using the `--dns=none` flag.\r\n\r\n* Bastions are now fronted by a Network Load Balancer.\r\n\r\n* Instance group images can now be dynamically fetched through an AWS SSM Parameter.\r\n\r\n* The AWS Load Balancer, when enabled, will run on worker nodes if IRSA is enabled as of Kubernetes version 1.24.\r\n\r\n* As of Kubernetes version 1.26 and with IRSA enabled, control plane nodes will now run with a max hop limit of 1 for the metadata service. This will prevent Pods without host networking from accessing the instance metadata service.\r\n\r\n* IPv6 is now beta. New IPv6 clusters now default to using private topology.\r\n\r\n* CapacityRebalance can be enabled/disabled on ASGs through a new `capacityRebalance` field in InstanceGroup specs.\r\n\r\n* New clusters can more easily be configured to use Cilium in ENI mode by setting `--networking=cilium-eni`.\r\n\r\n* Node Termination Handler now defaults to Queue-Processor mode. It also now enables Scheduled Event Draining by default.\r\n\r\n* Node Termination Handler, when in Queue-Processor mode, no longer drains on rebalance recommendations unless configured to do so.\r\n\r\n* When an S3 bucket for Service Account Issuer Discovery (IRSA) is public, kOps no longer sets object-level ACLs on the files placed therein.\r\n\r\n### GCP\r\n\r\n* Clusters can be created without DNS or Gossip, by using the `--dns=none` flag (experimental).\r\n\r\n* The default instance type is now `e2-medium` for control-plane and worker nodes, and `e2-micro` for bastions.\r\n\r\n### Hetzner\r\n\r\n* Clusters can be created without DNS or Gossip, by using the `--dns=none` flag.\r\n\r\n### OpenStack\r\n\r\n* Clusters can be created without DNS or Gossip, by using the `--dns=none` flag.\r\n\r\n* When creating new clusters kOps now sets the cluster name flag for the [external OpenStack cloud controller (OCCM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/15139) and the [Cinder CSI plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/15095).\r\n\r\n## Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* containerd config is now written to `/etc/containerd/config.toml`.\r\n\r\n* Cilium can be configured to add unreachable route for pod IP on deletion.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.20 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for CloudFormation has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The experimental support for using Vault as a state store has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for automated reboots with Flatcar has been removed. Use [FLUO](https://github.com/flatcar/flatcar-linux-update-operator/) instead, to gracefully reboot nodes.\r\n\r\n* The \"external\" networking option is not supported for Kubernetes 1.26 or later. For \"bring your own\"\r\nCNIs, use the \"cni\" networking option instead.\r\n\r\n* If the cluster autoscaler is configured to use the priority expander, kOps will automatically create its ConfigMap. If you still want to manage the ConfigMap manually, set `spec.clusterAutoscaler.createPriorityExpanderConfig: false`. See [the documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#priority-expander-configuration) for more details.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* The \"kops get [CLUSTER]\" command is deprecated.

NRI related block in the configuration file needs to be updated.\r\n\r\n  The NRI-related configuration and command line options have been updated to reflect the corresponding changes in NRI itself. In particular,\r\n\r\n  - remove 'nri_config_file' configuration file and '--nri-config-file' command line options\r\n  - add 'nri_plugin_config_dir' configuration and '--nri-plugin-config-dir' command line options to specify directory to scan for configuration of plugins pre-launched by the runtime\r\n  - add 'nri_disable_connections' configuration and '--nri-disable-connections' command line options to disable connections from externally launched plugins\r\n  - add 'nri_plugin_registration_timeout' configuration and '--nri-plugin-registration-timeout' command line options to allow overriding the default plugin registration timeout\r\n  - add 'nri_plugin_request_timeout' configuration and '--nri-plugin-request-timeout' command line options to allow overriding the default plugin request handling timeout (#6702, @klihub)\r\n\r\n## Changes by Kind\r\n\r\n### Dependency-Change\r\n\r\n- '/dev' is now mounted again without the 'noexec' flag. (#6618, @haircommander)\r\n- Update github.com/containers/image to v5.24 for sigstore features (#6635, @mrunalp)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Fix a bug where compilation failed when linking against btrfs-prog (#6508, @haircommander)\r\n\r\n### Uncategorized\r\n\r\n- Updated crun to v1.8.1.

`textencodebase64` function when called with encoding \"GB18030\" will now encode the euro symbol \u20ac as the two-byte sequence `0xA2,0xE3`, as required by the GB18030 standard, before applying base64 encoding.\n* config: The `textencodebase64` function when called with encoding \"GBK\" or \"CP936\" will now encode the euro symbol \u20ac as the single byte `0x80` before applying base64 encoding. This matches the behavior of the Windows API when encoding to this Windows-specific character encoding.\n* `terraform init`: When interpreting the hostname portion of a provider source address or the address of a module in a module registry, Terraform will now use _non-transitional_ IDNA2008 mapping rules instead of the transitional mapping rules previously used.\n\n    This matches a change to [the WHATWG URL spec's rules for interpreting non-ASCII domain names](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii) which is being gradually adopted by web browsers. Terraform aims to follow the interpretation of hostnames used by web browsers for consistency. For some hostnames containing non-ASCII characters this may cause Terraform to now request a different \"punycode\" hostname when resolving.\n* `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))\n* The Terraform plan renderer has been completely rewritten to aid with future Terraform Cloud integration. Users should not see any material change in the plan output between 1.3 and 1.4. If you notice any significant differences, or if Terraform fails to plan successfully due to rendering problems, please open a bug report issue.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* The module installer will now record in its manifest a correct module source URL after normalization when the URL given as input contains both a query string portion and a subdirectory portion. Terraform itself doesn't currently make use of this information and so this is just a cosmetic fix to make the recorded metadata more correct. ([#31636](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31636))\n* config: The `yamldecode` function now correctly handles entirely-nil YAML documents. Previously it would incorrectly return an unknown value instead of a null value. It will now return a null value as documented. ([#32151](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32151))\n* Ensure correct ordering between data sources and the deletion of managed resource dependencies. ([#32209](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32209))\n* Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))\n* `terraform workspace` now returns a non-zero exit when given an invalid argument ([#31318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31318))\n* Terraform would always plan changes when using a nested set attribute ([#32536](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32536))\n* Terraform can now better detect when complex optional+computed object attributes are removed from configuration ([#32551](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32551))\n* A new methodology for planning set elements can now better detect optional+computed changes within sets ([#32563](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32563))\n* Fix state locking and releasing messages when in `-json` mode, messages will now be written in JSON format ([#32451](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32451))\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* `terraform plan` can now store a plan file even when encountering errors, which can later be inspected to help identify the source of the failures ([#32395](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32395))\n* `terraform_data` is a new builtin managed resource type, which can replace the use of `null_resource`, and can store data of any type ([#31757](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31757))\n* `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file.

There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))\n* Interactive input for sensitive variables is now masked in the UI ([#29520](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29520))\n* A new `-or-create` flag was added to `terraform workspace select`, to aid in creating workspaces in automated situations ([#31633](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31633))\n* A new command was added for exporting Terraform function signatures in machine-readable format: `terraform metadata functions -json` ([#32487](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32487))\n* The \"Failed to install provider\" error message now includes the reason a provider could not be installed. ([#31898](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31898))\n* backend/gcs: Add `kms_encryption_key` argument, to allow encryption of state files using Cloud KMS keys. ([#24967](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24967))\n* backend/gcs: Add `storage_custom_endpoint` argument, to allow communication with the backend via a Private Service Connect endpoint. ([#28856](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28856))\n* backend/gcs: Update documentation for usage of `gcs` with `terraform_remote_state` ([#32065](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32065))\n* backend/gcs: Update storage package to v1.28.0 ([#29656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29656))\n* When removing a workspace from the `cloud` backend `terraform workspace delete` will use Terraform Cloud's [Safe Delete](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#safe-delete-a-workspace) API if the `-force` flag is not provided. ([#31949](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/31949))\n* backend/oss: More robustly handle endpoint retrieval error ([#32295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32295))\n* local-exec provisioner: Added `quiet` argument. If `quiet` is set to `true`, Terraform will not print the entire command to stdout during plan. ([#32116](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32116))\n* backend/http: Add support for mTLS authentication. ([#31699](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31699))\n* cloud: Add support for using the [generic hostname](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/using#generic-hostname-terraform-enterprise) localterraform.com in module and provider sources as a substitute for the currently configured cloud backend hostname. This enhancement was also applied to the remote backend.\n* `terraform show` will now print an explanation when called on a Terraform workspace with empty state detailing why no resources are shown. ([#32629](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32629))\n* backend/gcs: Added support for `GOOGLE_BACKEND_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` env var to allow impersonating a different service account when `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is configured for the GCP provider. ([#32557](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32557))\n* backend/cos: Add support for the `assume_role` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.\n* backend/cos: Add support for the `security_token` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.\n\nEXPERIMENTS:\n\n* Since its introduction the `yamlencode` function's documentation carried a warning that it was experimental. This predated our more formalized idea of language experiments and so wasn't guarded by an explicit opt-in, but the intention was to allow for small adjustments to its behavior if we learned it was producing invalid YAML in some cases, due to the relative complexity of the YAML specification.\n\n    From Terraform v1.4 onwards, `yamlencode` is no longer documented as experimental and is now subject to the Terraform v1.x Compatibility Promises. There are no changes to its previous behavior in v1.3 and so no special action is required when upgrading.\n\n", "created_at": "2023-03-08T18:03:30Z", "project": "Terraform", "repo": "hashicorp/terraform", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.21.3", "tag_name": "v0.21.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.21.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/coreos/flannel", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* documentation: use latest release by @laverya in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1723\r\n* fix randomness in k3s end to end tests by @thomasferrandiz in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1729\r\n* Bump golang.org/x/net from 0.4.0 to 0.7.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1727\r\n* Removed component from kustomzation manifest process by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1732\r\n* Fix etcd index outofrange by @thomasferrandiz in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1726\r\n* Reordered iptables rules by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1725\r\n* Added MTU config for vxlan and wireguard by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1736\r\n* Add helm chart  to deploy flannel by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1733\r\n* Added CNI plugins reference and removed older build docs by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1737\r\n* Update Flannel to v0.21.3 by @rbrtbnfgl in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1738\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @laverya made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1723\r\n* @dependabot made their first contribution in https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/pull/1727\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/compare/v0.21.2...v0.21.3", "created_at": "2023-03-08T15:21:32Z", "project": "Flannel", "repo": "coreos/flannel", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "6.2.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/commit/3caeb8ee1bef35036655ed12c198fd6adb4795d6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

The snapshot controller will also be more persistent in attempting to update the snapshot list.\r\n* Bump cri-dockerd [(#6798)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6798)\r\n  * The embedded cri-dockerd has been updated to v0.3.1\r\n* Bugfix: do not break cert-manager when pprof is enabled [(#6837)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6837)\r\n* Wait for cri-dockerd socket [(#6853)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6853)\r\n* Bump vagrant boxes to fedora37 [(#6858)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6858)\r\n* Fix cronjob example [(#6864)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6864)\r\n* Ensure flag type consistency [(#6867)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6867)\r\n* Consolidate E2E tests [(#6887)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6887)\r\n* Ignore value conflicts when reencrypting secrets [(#6919)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6919)\r\n* Use default address family when adding kubernetes service address to SAN list [(#6904)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6904)\r\n  * The apiserver advertised address and IP SAN entry are now set correctly on clusters that use IPv6 as the default IP family.\r\n* Allow ServiceLB to honor `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` [(#6907)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6907)\r\n  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.\r\n* Fix issue with servicelb startup failure when validating webhooks block creation [(#6916)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6916)\r\n  * The embedded cloud controller manager will no longer attempt to unconditionally re-create its namespace and serviceaccount on startup. This resolves an issue that could cause a deadlocked cluster when fail-closed webhooks are in use.\r\n* Backport user-provided CA cert and `kubeadm` bootstrap token support [(#6929)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6929)\r\n  * K3s now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before K3s starts in the github repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh).\r\n  * K3s now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `k3s token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.\r\n  * K3s agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.\r\n* Fix access to hostNetwork port on NodeIP when egress-selector-mode=agent [(#6936)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6936)\r\n  * Fixed an issue that would cause the apiserver egress proxy to attempt to use the agent tunnel to connect to service endpoints even in agent or disabled mode.\r\n* Updated flannel version to v0.21.1 [(#6915)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6915)\r\n* Allow for multiple sets of leader-elected controllers [(#6941)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6941)\r\n  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes\r\n* Fix etcd and ca-cert rotate issues [(#6954)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6954)\r\n* Fix ServiceLB dual-stack ingress IP listing [(#6987)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6987)\r\n  * Resolved an issue with ServiceLB that would cause it to advertise node IPv6 addresses, even if the cluster or service was not enabled for dual-stack operation.\r\n* Bump kine to v0.9.9 [(#6975)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6975)\r\n  * The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.9.9. Compaction log messages are now omitted at `info` level for increased visibility.\r\n* Update to v1.25.7-k3s1 [(#7010)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7010)\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.25.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#v1257) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.9.9](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.9.9) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.39.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_2.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.5.3-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.3-k3s1) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.6.15-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.15-k3s1) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.1.4](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.4) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.21.1](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.21.1) | \r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.6.2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.6.2) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.9.4](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.9.4) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.9.4](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.9.4) | \r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.13.1](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.13.1) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.23](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.23) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

In `8.0.12` only a small number of operations were eligible for `INSTANT`, but MySQL `8.0.29` added support for more common cases.\r\nUnfortunately, the changes in `8.0.29` affect XtraBackup as follows: if you `ALTER TABLE` in MySQL `8.0.29`, and that `ALTER` is eligible for `INSTANT` DDL (e.g. add new table column), then as of that moment, XtraBackup is unable to backup that table, hence your entire database.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that even if you then upgrade your MySQL server to, e.g. `8.0.32`, the table still cannot be backed up.\r\n\r\nVersions where XtraBackup is unable to backup such tables: MySQL `8.0.29` - `8.0.31`. This does not apply to Percona Server flavor.\r\n\r\nThe issue is resolved with Percona XtraBackup `8.0.32` combined with MySQL `8.0.32`.\r\n\r\nYou might be affected if:\r\n\r\n- You're using MySQL `8.0.29` - `8.0.31` and are using XtraBackup to backup your database\r\n- and, you have issued an `ALTER TABLE`, either directly, or using Online DDL in vitess `v16.0` and below\r\n\r\nA future Vitess patch release `v16.0.1` will address the issue via Online DDL migrations.\r\n\r\n#### Mitigations\r\n\r\n- Use Percona XtraBackup `8.0.32` combined with MySQL `8.0.32`. To go with this option, you can use the docker image `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql-8.0.32`.\r\n- or, Use a Percona Server flavor\r\n- or, always ensure to add `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` or `ALGORITHM=COPY` to your `ALTER TABLE` statements\r\n\r\n#### Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have already been affected, these are the options to be able to backup your database:\r\n\r\n- Use `builtin` backups, see https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/. `builtin` backups are not based on XtraBackup.\r\n- Upgrade to MySQL `8.0.32` or above and to Xtrabackup `8.0.32`, or switch to Percona Server. To go with this option, you can use the docker image `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql-8.0.32`. Then rebuild the table directly via:\r\n  - `OPTIMIZE TABLE your_table`\r\n  - or, `ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB`\r\n- Upgrade to Vitess patch release `v16.0.1`, upgrade to MySQL `8.0.32` or above and to Xtrabackup `8.0.32`, or switch to Percona Server, and rebuild the table via Online DDL:\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctldclient ApplySchema --skip_preflight --ddl_strategy \"vitess\" --sql \"ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB\" your_keyspace\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```sql\r\n> SET @@ddl_strategy='vitess';\r\n> ALTER TABLE your_table ENGINE=InnoDB;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"major-changes\"/>Major Changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"advertised-mysql-version\"/>VTGate Advertised MySQL Version\r\n\r\nSince [Pull Request #11989](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11989), VTGate advertises MySQL version 8.0.30. This is a breaking change for clients that rely on the VTGate advertised MySQL version and still use MySQL 5.7.\r\nThe users can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the correct version.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"default-mysql-version\"/>Default MySQL version on Docker\r\n\r\nThe default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `5.7` to `8.0`. Additionally, the patch version of MySQL80 has been upgraded from `8.0.23` to `8.0.30`.\r\nThis change was brought by [Pull Request #12252](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12252).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"upgrading-to-this-release-with-vitess-operator\"/>\u26a0\ufe0fUpgrading to this release with vitess-operator\r\n\r\nIf you are using the vitess-operator and want to remain on MySQL 5.7, **you are required** to use the `vitess/lite:v16.0.0-mysql57` Docker Image, otherwise the `vitess/lite:v16.0.0` image will be on MySQL 80.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are running MySQL 8.0 on the vitess-operator, with for instance `vitess/lite:v15.0.2-mysql80`, considering that we are bumping the patch version of MySQL 80 from `8.0.23` to `8.0.30`, you will have to manually upgrade:\r\n\r\n1. Add `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` to your extra cnf in your YAML file.\r\n2. Apply this file.\r\n3. Wait for all the pods to be healthy.\r\n4. Then change your YAML file to use the new Docker Images (`vitess/lite:v16.0.0`, defaults to mysql80).\r\n5. Remove `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` from your extra cnf in your YAML file.\r\n6. Apply this file.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"flag-deletions-and-deprecations\"\\>Flag Deletions and Deprecations\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vtctld-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTCtld\r\nWith the removal of the vtctld UI, the following vtctld flags have been deprecated:\r\n- `--vtctld_show_topology_crud`: This was a flag that controlled the display of CRUD topology actions in the vtctld UI. The UI is removed, so this flag is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nThe following deprecated flags have also been removed:\r\n- `--enable_realtime_stats`\r\n- `--enable_vtctld_ui`\r\n- `--web_dir`\r\n- `--web_dir2`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_init`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_use_election`\r\n- `--workflow_manager_disable`\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"mysqlctl-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>MySQLCtld\r\n\r\nThe [`mysqlctl` command-line client](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/programs/mysqlctl/) had some leftover (ignored) server flags after the [v15 pflag work](https://github.com/vitessio/enhancements/blob/main/veps/vep-4.md). Those unused flags have now been removed. If you are using any of the following flags with `mysqlctl` in your scripts or other tooling, they will need to be removed prior to upgrading to v16:\r\n`--port --grpc_auth_static_client_creds --grpc_compression --grpc_initial_conn_window_size --grpc_initial_window_size --grpc_keepalive_time --grpc_keepalive_timeout`\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vttablet-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTTablet\r\n\r\nThe following flags were removed in v16:\r\n- `--enable_semi_sync`\r\n- `--backup_storage_hook`, use one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n- `--init_populate_metadata`, since we have deleted the `local_metadata` and `shard_metadata` sidecar database tables.\r\n\r\nThe flag `--disable-replication-manager` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vtbackup-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTBackup\r\n\r\nThe VTBackup flag `--backup_storage_hook` has been removed, use one of the builtin compression algorithms or `--external-compressor` and `--external-decompressor` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a id=\"vtorc-flag-deletions-deprecations\"/>VTOrc\r\n\r\nThe flag `--lock-shard-timeout` has been deprecated. Please use the newly introduced `--lock-timeout` flag instead. More detail [here](#lock-timeout-introduction).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"lock-timeout-introduction\"/>`lock-timeout` and `remote_operation_timeout` Changes\r\n\r\nBefore the changes made in [Pull Request #11881](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11881), the shard and keyspace locks used to be capped by the `remote_operation_timeout`. This is no longer the case and instead a new flag called `lock-timeout` is introduced.\r\nFor backward compatibility, if `lock-timeout` is unspecified and `remote_operation_timeout` flag is provided, then its value will also be used for `lock-timeout`.\r\nThe default value for `remote_operation_timeout` has also changed from 30 seconds to 15 seconds. The default for the new flag `lock-timeout` is 45 seconds.\r\n\r\nDuring upgrades, if the users want to preserve the same behaviour as previous releases, then they should provide the `remote_operation_timeout` flag explicitly before upgrading.\r\nAfter the upgrade, they should then alter their configuration to also specify `lock-timeout` explicitly.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"orc-integration-removal\"/>Orchestrator Integration Deletion\r\n\r\nOrchestrator integration in `vttablet` was deprecated in the previous release and is deleted in this release.\r\n`VTOrc` should be deployed instead. You can read more on [how VTOrc is designed](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vtorc/) and on [how to run VTOrc in production](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/user-guides/configuration-basic/vtorc/).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtcltd-ui-removal\"/>vtctld web UI Removal\r\nIn v13, the vtctld UI was deprecated. As of this release, the `web/vtctld2` directory is deleted and the UI will no longer be included in any Vitess images going forward. All build scripts and the Makefile have been updated to reflect this change, which was done in [Pull Request #11851](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11851)\r\n\r\nHowever, the vtctld HTTP API will remain at `{$vtctld_web_port}/api`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"qs-errors\"/>Query Serving Errors\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #10738](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/10738) we are introducing a new way to report errors from Vitess through the query interface.\r\nErrors will now have an error code for each error, which will make it easy to search for more information on the issue.\r\nFor instance, the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\naggregate functions take a single argument 'count(user_id, name)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be transformed into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVT03001: aggregate functions take a single argument 'count(user_id, name)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error code `VT03001` can then be used to search or ask for help and report problems.\r\n\r\nIf you have code searching for error strings from Vitess, this is a breaking change.\r\nMany error strings have been tweaked.\r\nIf your application is searching for specific errors, you might need to update your code.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"logstats-table-keyspace\"/>Logstats Table and Keyspace removed\r\n\r\nInformation about which tables are used is now reported by the field TablesUsed added in v15, that is a string array, listing all tables and which keyspace they are in.\r\nThe Table/Keyspace fields were deprecated in v15 and are now removed in the v16 release, more information can be found on [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"removed-stats\"/>Removed Stats\r\n\r\nThe stat `QueryRowCounts` is removed in v16 as part of [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083). `QueryRowsAffected` and `QueryRowsReturned` can be used instead to gather the same information.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-stats\"/>Deprecated Stats\r\n\r\nThe stats `QueriesProcessed` and `QueriesRouted` are deprecated in v16 as part of [Pull Request #12083](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12083). The same information can be inferred from the stats `QueriesProcessedByTable` and `QueriesRoutedByTable` respectively. These stats will be removed in the next release.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"normalized-lables\"/>Normalized labels in the Prometheus Exporter\r\n\r\nThe Prometheus metrics exporter now properly normalizes _all_ label names into their `snake_case` form, as it is idiomatic for Prometheus metrics. Previously, Vitess instances were emitting inconsistent labels for their metrics, with some of them being `CamelCase` and others being `snake_case`.\r\nMore information about this change can be found on [Pull Request #12057](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12057).\r\n\r\nFor example, `vtgate_topology_watcher_errors{Operation=\"GetTablet\"} 0` will become `vtgate_topology_watcher_errors{operation=\"GetTablet\"} 0`\r\n\r\nSome more of these changes are listed here -\r\n\r\n| Previous metric                                             | New Metric                                                  |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| vtgate_topology_watcher_operations{Operation=\"AddTablet\"}   | vtgate_topology_watcher_operations{operation=\"AddTablet\"}   |\r\n| vtgate_queries_processed{Plan=\"Reference\"}                  | vtgate_queries_processed{plan=\"Reference\"}                  |\r\n| vtgate_queries_routed{Plan=\"Reference\"}                     | vtgate_queries_routed{plan=\"Reference\"}                     |\r\n| vttablet_table_allocated_size{Table=\"corder\"}               | vttablet_table_allocated_size{table=\"corder\"}               |\r\n| vttablet_table_file_size{Table=\"corder\"}                    | vttablet_table_file_size{table=\"corder\"}                    |\r\n| vttablet_topology_watcher_errors{Operation=\"GetTablet\"}     | vttablet_topology_watcher_errors{operation=\"GetTablet\"}     |\r\n| vttablet_topology_watcher_operations{Operation=\"AddTablet\"} | vttablet_topology_watcher_operations{operation=\"AddTablet\"} |\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"repl-manager-removal\"/>Replication manager removal and VTOrc becomes mandatory\r\nVTOrc is now a **required** component of Vitess starting from v16. If the users want Vitess to manage replication, then they must run VTOrc.\r\nReplication manager is removed from vttablets since the responsibility of fixing replication lies entirely with VTOrc now.\r\nThe flag `disable-replication-manager` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vstream-copy-resume\"/>VStream Copy Resume\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11103](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11103) we introduced the ability to resume a `VTGate` [`VStream` copy operation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/). This is useful when a [`VStream` copy operation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/) is interrupted due to e.g. a network failure or a server restart. The `VStream` copy operation can be resumed by specifying each table's last seen primary key value in the `VStream` request. Please see the [`VStream` docs](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vstream/) for more details.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vdiff2-ga\"/>VDiff2 GA\r\n\r\nWe are marking [VDiff v2](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/vdiff2/) as production-ready in v16. We now recommend that you use v2 rather than v1 going forward. V1 will be deprecated and eventually removed in future releases.\r\nIf you wish to use v1 for any reason, you will now need to specify the `--v1` flag.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet throttler\r\n\r\nThe tablet throttler can now be configured dynamically. Configuration is now found in the topo service, and applies to all tablets in all shards and cells of a given keyspace.\r\nIt is possible to enable or disable throttling, and to change the throttling threshold as well as the throttler query.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this feature is considered experimental in this release. For backwards compatibility `v16` still supports `vttablet`-based command line flags for throttler configuration.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on [Pull Request #11604](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11604).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"inc-backup\"/>Incremental backup and point in time recovery\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11097](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11097) we introduced native incremental backup and point in time recovery:\r\n\r\n- It is possible to take an incremental backup, starting with last known (full or incremental) backup, and up to either a specified (GTID) position, or current (\"auto\") position.\r\n- The backup is done by copying binary logs. The binary logs are rotated as needed.\r\n- It is then possible to restore a backup up to a given point in time (GTID position). This involves finding a restore path consisting of a full backup and zero or more incremental backups, applied up to the given point in time.\r\n- A server restored to a point in time remains in `DRAINED` tablet type, and does not join the replication stream (thus, \"frozen\" in time).\r\n- It is possible to take incremental backups from different tablets. It is OK to have overlaps in incremental backup contents. The restore process chooses a valid path, and is valid as long as there are no gaps in the backed up binary log content.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-flag\"/>New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-query-timeout\"/>VTGate: Support query timeout --query-timeout\r\n\r\n`--query-timeout` allows you to specify a timeout for queries. This timeout is applied to all queries.\r\nIt can be overridden by setting the `query_timeout` session variable.\r\nSetting it as query comment directive with `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` will override other values.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vrepl-parallel-workers\"/>VTTablet: VReplication parallel insert workers --vreplication-parallel-insert-workers\r\n\r\n`--vreplication-parallel-insert-workers=[integer]` enables parallel bulk inserts during the copy phase\r\nof VReplication (disabled by default). When set to a value greater than 1 the bulk inserts \u2014 each\r\nexecuted as a single transaction from the vstream packet contents \u2014 may happen in-parallel and\r\nout-of-order, but the commit of those transactions are still serialized in order.\r\n\r\nOther aspects of the VReplication copy-phase logic are preserved:\r\n\r\n  1. All statements executed when processing a vstream packet occur within a single MySQL transaction.\r\n  2. Writes to `_vt.copy_state` always follow their corresponding inserts from within the vstream packet.\r\n  3. The final `commit` for the vstream packet always follows the corresponding write to `_vt.copy_state`.\r\n  4. The vstream packets are committed in the order seen in the stream. So for any PK1 and PK2, the write to `_vt.copy_state` and  `commit` steps (steps 2 and 3 above) for PK1 will both precede the `_vt.copy_state` write and commit steps of PK2.\r\n\r\n Other phases, catchup, fast-forward, and replicating/\"running\", are unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"queryserver-lifetime\"/>VTTablet: --queryserver-config-pool-conn-max-lifetime\r\n\r\n`--queryserver-config-pool-conn-max-lifetime=[integer]` allows you to set a timeout on each connection in the query server connection pool. It chooses a random value between its value and twice its value, and when a connection has lived longer than the chosen value, it'll be removed from the pool the next time it's returned to the pool.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-throttler-config\"/>vttablet --throttler-config-via-topo\r\n\r\nThe flag `--throttler-config-via-topo` switches throttler configuration from `vttablet`-flags to the topo service. This flag is `false` by default, for backwards compatibility. It will default to `true` in future versions.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-update-throttler\"/>vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig\r\n\r\nTablet throttler configuration is now supported in `topo`. Updating the throttler configuration is done via `vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig` and applies to all tablet in all cells for a given keyspace.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# disable throttler; all throttler checks will return with \"200 OK\"\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --disable commerce\r\n\r\n# enable throttler; checks are responded with appropriate status per current metrics\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --enable commerce\r\n\r\n# Both enable and set threshold in same command. Since no query is indicated, we assume the default check for replication lag\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --enable --threshold 5.0 commerce\r\n\r\n# Change threshold. Does not affect enabled/disabled state of the throttler\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --threshold 1.5 commerce\r\n\r\n# Use a custom query\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --custom_query \"show global status like 'threads_running'\" --check_as_check_self --threshold 50 commerce\r\n\r\n# Restore default query and threshold\r\n$ vtctldclient UpdateThrottlerConfig --custom_query \"\" --check_as_check_shard --threshold 1.5 commerce\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11604\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-backup\"/>vtctldclient Backup --incremental_from_pos\r\n\r\nThe `Backup` command now supports `--incremental_from_pos` flag, which can receive a valid position or the value `auto`. For example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctlclient -- Backup --incremental_from_pos \"MySQL56/16b1039f-22b6-11ed-b765-0a43f95f28a3:1-615\" zone1-0000000102\r\n$ vtctlclient -- Backup --incremental_from_pos \"auto\" zone1-0000000102\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the value is `auto`, the position is evaluated as the last successful backup's `Position`. The idea with incremental backups is to create a contiguous (overlaps allowed) sequence of backups that store all changes from last full backup.\r\n\r\nThe incremental backup copies binary log files. It does not take MySQL down nor places any locks. It does not interrupt traffic on the MySQL server. The incremental backup copies complete binlog files. It initially rotates binary logs, then copies anything from the requested position and up to the last completed binary log.\r\n\r\nThe backup thus does not necessarily start _exactly_ at the requested position. It starts with the first binary log that has newer entries than requested position. It is OK if the binary logs include transactions prior to the requested position. The restore process will discard any duplicates.\r\n\r\nNormally, you can expect the backups to be precisely contiguous. Consider an `auto` value: due to the nature of log rotation and the fact we copy complete binlog files, the next incremental backup will start with the first binay log not covered by the previous backup, which in itself copied the one previous binlog file in full. Again, it is completely valid to enter any good position.\r\n\r\nThe incremental backup fails if it is unable to attain binary logs from given position (ie binary logs have been purged).\r\n\r\nThe manifest of an incremental backup has a non-empty `FromPosition` value, and a `Incremental = true` value.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtctldclient-restore-from-backup\"/>vtctldclient RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos\r\n\r\n- `--restore_to_pos`: request to restore the server up to the given position (inclusive) and not one step further.\r\n- `--dry_run`:        when `true`, calculate the restore process, if possible, evaluate a path, but exit without actually making any changes to the server.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vtctlclient -- RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos  \"MySQL56/16b1039f-22b6-11ed-b765-0a43f95f28a3:1-220\" zone1-0000000102\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe restore process seeks a restore _path_: a sequence of backups (handles/manifests) consisting of one full backup followed by zero or more incremental backups, that can bring the server up to the requested position, inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe command fails if it cannot evaluate a restore path. Possible reasons:\r\n\r\n- there's gaps in the incremental backups\r\n- existing backups don't reach as far as requested position\r\n- all full backups exceed requested position (so there's no way to get into an ealier position)\r\n\r\nThe command outputs the restore path.\r\n\r\nThere may be multiple restore paths, the command prefers a path with the least number of backups. This has nothing to say about the amount and size of binary logs involved.\r\n\r\nThe `RestoreFromBackup  --restore_to_pos` ends with:\r\n\r\n- the restored server in intentionally broken replication setup\r\n- tablet type is `DRAINED`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"new-vexplain-command\"/>New `vexplain` command\r\nA new `vexplain` command has been introduced with the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nVEXPLAIN [ALL|QUERIES|PLAN] explainable_stmt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will help users look at the plan that vtgate comes up with for the given query (`PLAN` type), see all the queries that are executed on all the MySQL instances (`QUERIES` type), and see the vtgate plan along with the MySQL explain output for the executed queries (`ALL` type).\r\n\r\nThe formats `VTEXPLAIN` and `VITESS` for `EXPLAIN` queries are deprecated, and these newly introduced commands should be used instead.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"important-bug-fixes\"/>Important bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"corrupted-results\"/>Corrupted results for non-full-group-by queries with JOINs\r\n\r\nAn issue in versions `<= v14.0.3` and `<= v15.0.0` that generated corrupted results for non-full-group-by queries with a JOIN\r\nis now fixed. The full issue can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/11625), and its fix [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11633).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecations-removals\"/>Deprecations and Removals\r\n\r\n- The V3 planner is deprecated as of the v16 release, and will be removed in the v17 release of Vitess.\r\n\r\n- The [VReplication v1 commands](https://vitess.io/docs/15.0/reference/vreplication/v1/) \u2014 which were deprecated in Vitess 11.0 \u2014 have been removed. You will need to use the [VReplication v2 commands](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/vreplication/v2/) instead.\r\n\r\n- The `vtctlclient VExec` command was removed, having been deprecated since v12.\r\n\r\n- The `vtctlclient VReplicationExec` command has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please see [#12070](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12070) for additional details.\r\n\r\n- `vtctlclient OnlineDDL ... [complete|retry|cancel|cancel-all]` returns empty result on success instead of number of shard affected.\r\n\r\n- The dead legacy Workflow Manager related code was removed in [#12085](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12085). This included the following `vtctl` client commands: `WorkflowAction`, `WorkflowCreate`, `WorkflowWait`, `WorkflowStart`, `WorkflowStop`, `WorkflowTree`, `WorkflowDelete`.\r\n\r\n- VTAdmin's `VTExplain` endpoint has been deprecated. Users can use the new `vexplain` query format instead. The endpoint will be deleted in a future release.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"mysql-compatibility\"/>MySQL Compatibility\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"transaction-isolation-level\"/>Transaction Isolation Level\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11704](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11704) we are adding support for `set [session] transaction isolation level <transaction_characteristic>`\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ntransaction_characteristic: {\r\n    ISOLATION LEVEL level\r\n  | access_mode\r\n}\r\n\r\nlevel: {\r\n     REPEATABLE READ\r\n   | READ COMMITTED\r\n   | READ UNCOMMITTED\r\n   | SERIALIZABLE\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will set the transaction isolation level for the current session.\r\nThis will be applied to any shard where the session will open a transaction.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"transaction-access-mode\"/>Transaction Access Mode\r\n\r\nIn [Pull Request #11704](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11704) we are adding support for `start transaction` with transaction characteristic.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSTART TRANSACTION\r\n    [transaction_characteristic [, transaction_characteristic] ...]\r\n\r\ntransaction_characteristic: {\r\n    WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT\r\n  | READ WRITE\r\n  | READ ONLY\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow users to start a transaction with these characteristics.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"support-views\"/>Support For Views\r\n\r\nViews sharded support is released as an experimental feature in `v16.0.0`.\r\nViews are not enabled by default in your Vitess cluster, but they can be turned on using the `--enable-views` flag on VTGate, and `--queryserver-enable-views` flag on VTTablet.\r\n\r\nTo read more on how views are implemented you can read the [Views Support RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/11559).\r\nAnd if you want to learn more on how to use views and its current limitations, you can read the [Views Documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/compatibility/mysql-compatibility/#views).\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttestserver\"/>VTTestServer\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"perf-improvement\"/>Performance Improvement\r\n\r\nCreating a database with vttestserver was taking ~45 seconds. This can be problematic in test environments where testcases do a lot of `create` and `drop` database.\r\nIn an effort to minimize the database creation time, in [Pull Request #11918](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/11918) we have changed the value of `tablet_refresh_interval` to 10s while instantiating vtcombo during vttestserver initialization. We have also made this configurable so that it can be reduced further if desired.\r\nFor any production cluster the default value of this flag is still [1 minute](https://vitess.io/docs/16.0/reference/programs/vtgate/). Reducing this value might put more stress on Topo Server (since we now read from Topo server more often) but for testing purposes\r\nthis shouldn't be a concern.\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"backup-comp-benchmarks\"/>Backup Compression Benchmarks\r\n\r\nCompression benchmarks have been added to the `mysqlctl` package.\r\n\r\nThe benchmarks fetch and compress a ~6 GiB tar file containing 3 InnoDB files using different built-in and external compressors.\r\n\r\nHere are sample results from a 2020-era Mac M1 with 16 GiB of memory:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ go test -bench=BenchmarkCompress ./go/vt/mysqlctl -run=NONE -timeout=12h -benchtime=1x -v\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: arm64\r\npkg: vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/mysqlctl\r\nBenchmarkCompressLz4Builtin\r\n    compression_benchmark_test.go:310: downloading data from https://www.dropbox.com/s/raw/smmgifsooy5qytd/enwiki-20080103-pages-articles.ibd.tar.zst\r\n    BenchmarkCompressLz4Builtin-8                  1        11737493087 ns/op        577.98 MB/s             2.554 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPargzipBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPargzipBuiltin-8              1        31083784040 ns/op        218.25 MB/s             2.943 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPgzipBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressPgzipBuiltin-8                1        13325299680 ns/op        509.11 MB/s             2.910 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdBuiltin\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdBuiltin-8                 1        18683863911 ns/op        363.09 MB/s             3.150 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternal\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternal-8                1        10795487675 ns/op        628.41 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalFast4\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalFast4-8           1        7139319009 ns/op         950.23 MB/s             2.323 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT0\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT0-8              1        4393860434 ns/op        1543.97 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT4\r\n    BenchmarkCompressZstdExternalT4-8              1        4389559744 ns/op        1545.49 MB/s             3.093 compression-ratio\r\n    PASS\r\n    cleaning up \"/var/folders/96/k7gzd7q10zdb749vr02q7sjh0000gn/T/ee7d47b45ef09786c54fa2d7354d2a68.dat\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"refactor\"/>Refactor\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet-sidecar-schema\"/>VTTablet Sidecar Schema Maintenance Refactor\r\n\r\nThis is an internal refactor and should not change the behavior of Vitess as seen by users. \r\n\r\nDevelopers will see a difference though: v16 changes the way we maintain vttablet's sidecar database schema (also referred to as the `_vt`\r\ndatabase). Instead of using the `WithDDL` package, introduced in [PR #6348](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/6348), we use a\r\ndeclarative approach. Developers will now have to update the desired schema in the `go/vt/sidecardb/schema` directory.\r\n\r\nThe desired schema is specified, one per table. A new module `sidecardb`, compares this to the existing schema and\r\nperforms the required `create` or `alter` to reach it. This is done whenever a primary vttablet starts up.\r\n\r\nThe sidecar tables `local_metadata` and `shard_metadata` are no longer in use and all references to them are removed as\r\npart of this refactor. They were used previously for Orchestrator support, which has been superseded by `vtorc`.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/doc/releasenotes/16_0_0_changelog.md).\r\n\r\nThe release includes 378 commits (excluding merges)\r\n\r\nThanks to all our contributors: @EmadMokhtar, @GuptaManan100, @Weijun-H, @WilliamLu99, @ajm188, @arthurschreiber, @arvind-murty, @brendar, @brirams, @dbussink, @deepthi, @dependabot[bot], @draftcode, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @jjh-kim, @johanoskarsson, @kbslvsk, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pbibra, @pudiva, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rsajwani, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot[bot], @vmg, @yoheimuta\r\n", "created_at": "2023-02-28T15:09:03Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.9.2", "tag_name": "knative-v1.9.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.9.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## Changes since [1.9.1](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/knative-v1.9.1)\r\n\r\nRebuilt with go1.19.6 to address CVEs\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.19.6+label%3ACherryPickApproved", "created_at": "2023-02-28T11:21:15Z", "project": "Knative", "repo": "knative/serving", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.14.3", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/893d01b5c66935a0721f2210b75ee57bf6e3963e", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.14.3 (#80083)", "created_at": "2023-02-27T15:00:30Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "0.13.0", "tag_name": "v0.13.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.13.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs", "body": "### Added\r\n\r\n- Support using personal access token in the password field.

Previously only the builder type or the builder\n     name, if it was set, would be displayed. Now for named builders\n     (`\"name\":\"mybuilder\"`) the builder's type and name will be displayed (i.e\n     \"<type>.mybuilder\".

native histograms and breaking changes.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying native histograms already, we recommend you remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.\r\nBecause the old WAL record for native histograms is not backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data loss for the latest data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you scrape \"float histograms\" or use recording rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float histograms),\r\nit is a one-way street since older versions do not support float histograms.\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the experimental native histograms. #11783\r\n* [FEATURE] Add 'keep_firing_for' field to alerting rules. #11827\r\n* [FEATURE] Promtool: Add support of selecting timeseries for TSDB dump. #11872\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Agent: Native histogram support. #11842\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Support native histograms in recording rules. #11838\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add container ID as a meta label for pod targets for Kubernetes. #11844\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add VM size label to azure service discovery. #11650\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support native histograms in federation. #11830\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Add gauge histogram support. #11783 #11840 #11814\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB/Scrape: Support FloatHistogram that represents buckets as float64 values. #11522 #11817 #11716\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] UI:

For more information, see [CVE-2022-43758](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-34p5-jp77-fcrc).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where sensitive fields and credentials like secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys were stored as plaintext on Kubernetes objects. This is a follow-up security fix to address the fields missed in [CVE-2021-36782](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f). For more information, see [CVE-2022-43757](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-cq4p-vp5q-4522).\r\n\r\n- Improved the generation process of Rancher's `cattle-token` to make the token random. Before, `cattle-token` did not use any random value in its composition, which caused the token to be always predictable. For more information, see [CVE-2022-43755](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8c69-r38j-rpfj).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an authorization logic flaw that allowed an authenticated user on any downstream cluster to (1) open a shell pod in the Rancher local cluster and (2) have limited kubectl access to the local cluster. For more information, see [CVE-2022-21953](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g25r-gvq3-wrq7).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following security related updates were performed in this release to address security issues:\r\n\r\n- Fixed a validation check issue where Rancher generated tokens are not revoked after modifications are made to a configured authentication provider. This issue is only applicable if external authentication providers were configured in Rancher. For more information, see security advisory [GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9).\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of Rancher's Fleet chart to `101.0.1+up0.5.1` to address two security issues in [`rancher/wrangler`](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler) dependency:\r\n\r\n  - The high severity [CVE-2022-31249](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-qrg7-hfx7-95c5) that could lead to a command injection vulnerability in Rancher's Continuous Delivery feature through Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n  - The medium severity [CVE-2022-43756](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-8fcj-gf77-47mg) that could cause a denial of service (DoS) attack in Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of [`crewjam/saml`](https://github.com/crewjam/saml) SAML library to address the critical severity [CVE-2022-41912](https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-j2jp-wvqg-wc2g).\r\n\r\n- Updated the base image version of Rancher `rancher/rancher` and Rancher Agent `rancher/rancher-agent` images from SUSE's SLE BCI Base 15 SP3 to 15 SP4 [`registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4`](https://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base-15sp4/index.html) due to 15 SP3 reaching its end-of-life (EOL).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) page or in Rancher's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue where handlers would infinitely loop if a user had no tokens, or the user only had tokens that did not have their ExtraByProvider field set. See [#39401](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39401).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Pods critical to running Rancher did not use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for its sidecar audit logging instead of busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. Rancher recommends admins to add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not be able to perform some of the actions within Azure AD if the permissions are insufficient, so you may encounter errors.\r\n- For RKE2/K3s node driver clusters, when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app, the behavior has changed for pulling images. Previously, only the global container registry was used. As of this release, by default, if a private registry exists in the cluster config, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. To change the default registry, a custom registry can be specified during the Helm chart install/upgrade workflow.\r\n- Beginning with Rancher 2.6.9, Rancher was built using go version 1.19. As part of this upgrade, Rancher's clients will only communicate with servers running tls version 1.2 or higher. Ensure that any servers integrated with rancher are upgraded to use this tls version or higher before upgrading to this version of rancher.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.1\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.6 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.12\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Provisioning new RKE1 clusters with a password-protected private registry may fail. See [#40321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40321#issuecomment-1407095199) for a workaround and more information on the issue.\r\n    - In RKE1 clusters on Kubernetes v1.24, cadvisor `container` labels and metric series break Monitoring V2 dashboards. See [#38934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38934#issuecomment-1294585708) for a workaround and more details on the issue.\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Kubernetes RKE1 1.24.x clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4; high CPU usage is also observed. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-01-24T17:33:32Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.5.7", "tag_name": "v3.5.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd", "body": "Please check out [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.5.md) for a full list of changes.

This release is a new effort and is not related to a previous preview of code released in the [2.x-archive](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/2.x-archive) branch which was an experimental re-architecture of Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Server HTTP API and wire data formats *have not changed* for the 2.0.0 release. Eureka servers and clients should be backwards and forwards compatible over the wire. This release was primarily driven for compatibility with [Spring Framework 6.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga) and [Spring Boot 3.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/24/spring-boot-3-0-goes-ga) and the change to [Jakarta EE 9](https://jakarta.ee/release/9/).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\nThe Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API is not backwards compatible with 1.x.\r\nEureka 1.x included support for Jersey 1 and optional Support for Jersey 2. In many cases, Jersey 1 was the default and was baked into the `eureka-core` and `eureka-client` modules. Having a default client has been removed. The new `eureka-client-jersey3` and `eureka-core-jersey3` should now be used if no other implementation is provided (such as Spring Cloud support for a `RestTemplate` implementation).\r\nThe [`DiscoveryClient constructors`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/b03151940fe2a647bb0697bb0c6f1057f4db46e8/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java#L236-L279) have been updated to have a new required [`TransportClientFactories`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/2.x/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/shared/transport/jersey/TransportClientFactories.java) parameter. The majority of the Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API has remained unchanged.\r\nAll references to `javax.*` classes have been changed to `jakarta.*` classes and the appropriate modules have been added.\r\nThe `eureka-server-governator` module was removed. There is no current support for the JakartaEE version of `@Inject`.\r\nThe `eureka-server` module currently does not build a functional WAR file. The recommended way of creating a Eureka 2.0.0 server is via Spring Cloud Netflix as a Spring Boot application.\r\nThe build now requires JDK 11 because of some tests that require Jetty and the version of Jetty that supports Jakarta EE 9 requires Java 11. The build still targets Java 8.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease try things out and provide any feedback or issues at https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues.\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-30T01:19:24Z", "project": "Eureka", "repo": "Netflix/eureka", "type": "Discovery", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.5.1 / 2022-11-29", "tag_name": "v1.5.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/releases/tag/v1.5.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway", "body": "* [SECURITY] Fix basic authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2022-46146). #516\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-29T16:29:58Z", "project": "Pushgateway", "repo": "prometheus/pushgateway", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.4.0", "tag_name": "v3.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/openebs/openebs/releases/tag/v3.4.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openebs/openebs", "body": "## Release Summary\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 OpenEBS 3.4 welcomes exciting new changes to our NVMe-first storage engine Mayastor with the release of v2.0.0.
