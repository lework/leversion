{"updated_at": "2022-12-20T02:11:24Z", "total": 120, "data": [{"name": "v1.85.2", "tag_name": "v1.85.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.85.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "### Changes\r\n\r\n## [v1.85.2](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.85.2)\r\n\r\nReleased at 2022-12-19\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: support overriding of `-search.latencyOffset` value via URL param `latency_offset` when performing requests to [/api/v1/query](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#instant-query) and [/api/v1/query_range](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#range-query). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3481).\r\n* FEATURE: allow changing field names in JSON logs if VictoriaMetrics components are started with `-loggerFormat=json` command-line flags. The field names can be changed with the `-loggerJSONFields` command-line flag. For example `-loggerJSONFields=ts:timestamp,msg:message` would rename `ts` and `msg` fields on the output JSON to `timestamp` and `message` fields. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2348). Thanks to @michal-kralik for [the pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3488).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): expose `__meta_consul_tag_<tagname>` and `__meta_consul_tagpresent_<tagname>` labels for targets discovered via [consul_sd_configs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#consul_sd_configs). This simplifies converting [Consul service tags](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/discovery/services#service-definition) to target labels with a simple [relabeling rule](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabeling):\r\n```yml\r\n- action: labelmap\r\n  regex: __meta_consul_tag_(.+)\r\n```\r\nThis resolves [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44339461/relabeling-in-prometheus).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: properly return query results for time series, which stop receiving new samples after the rotation of `indexdb`. Previously such time series could be missing in query results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3502). The issue has been introduced in [v1.83.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1830).\r\n* BUGFIX: allow specifying values bigger than 2GiB to the following command-line flag values on 32-bit architectures (`386` and `arm`): `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` and `-remoteWrite.maxDiskUsagePerURL`. Previously values bigger than 2GiB were incorrectly truncated on these architectures.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): stop dropping metric name by a mistake on the [/metric-relabel-debug](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#relabel-debug) page.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-12-19T21:38:42Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "containerd 1.6.14", "tag_name": "v1.6.14", "html_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.14", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "body": "Welcome to the v1.6.14 release of containerd!\n\nThe fourteenth patch release for containerd 1.6 fixes a regression in the CRI plugin related to swap\n\n### Notable Updates\n\n* **Fix `memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes: no such file or directory` error in CRI plugin** ([#7838](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7838))\n\nSee the changelog for complete list of changes\n\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\n\n### Contributors\n\n* Phil Estes\n* Derek McGowan\n* Akihiro Suda\n* Cameron Sparr\n* Akhil Mohan\n* Kazuyoshi Kato\n* Sebastiaan van Stijn\n* Serge Logvinov\n* Wang Bing\n* Wei Fu\n* cathaysia\n* shi yixue\n* wusong\n\n### Changes\n<details><summary>6 commits</summary>\n<p>\n\n* Prepare release notes for v1.6.14 ([#7841](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7841))\n  * [`1347d7c87`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1347d7c87b01fb27b44a8c3f16b1e8c18ca656bc) Prepare release notes for v1.6.14\n* [release/1.6] cri: fix `memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes: no such file or directory` ([#7838](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7838))\n  * [`53c733e0b`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/53c733e0bacd44d52cbe58a31dbc1ff2ca0d5403) cri: fix `memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes: no such file or directory`\n* Revert \"[release/1.6] support fetching containerd from non public GCS buckets\" ([#7830](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/7830))\n  * [`e8b22c100`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/e8b22c100b33e4f9eab68050a2b75deb7f0fadf1) Revert \"[release/1.6] support fetching containerd from non public GCS buckets\"\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Changes from containerd/cgroups\n<details><summary>21 commits</summary>\n<p>\n\n* ParseCgroupFile: fix wrong comment about unified hierarchy ;

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\nErlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)\r\nacross all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.11.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Backported a number of improvements for non-ASCII character handling in paths on Windows.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5551](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5551)\r\n\r\n * Backported a number of free disk space monitor resiliency improvements.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#5831](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5831)\r\n\r\n * If `handle.exe` is not available, free disk space monitor will now shell out to PowerShell\r\n   to retrieve the number of open file handles used by the node.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6613](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/6613)\r\n\r\n * `raft.adaptive_failure_detector.poll_interval` exposes [`aten`]()'s `poll_interval` setting to\r\n   RabbitMQ users. Increasing it can reduce the probability of false positives in clusters where\r\n   inter-node communication links are used at close to maximum capacity.\r\n   The default is `5000` (5 seconds).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6632](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6632)\r\n\r\n * When both `disk_free_limit.relative` and `disk_free_limit.absolute`,\r\n   or both `vm_memory_high_watermark.relative` and `vm_memory_high_watermark.absolute` are set,\r\n   the absolute settings will now take precedence.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge (AWS).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4980](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4980)\r\n\r\n * Closing channels will now log a warning if they had any messages pending a [confirmation from the server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/publishers.html#data-safety).\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @Kiruamvp.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#1399](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1399)\r\n\r\n * New quorum queue option for in-memory table (MemTable) compression.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6590](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6590)\r\n\r\n * Default queue type (a virtual host setting) is now applied when importing definitions\r\n   into a single virtual host.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6599](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6599)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Feature flags provided by plugins were mistakingly disabled after node restart.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6500](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/6500)\r\n\r\n * Classic queues with [Single Active Consumer](https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#single-active-consumer) enabled could run into an exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6502](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6502)\r\n\r\n * When a [global parameter](https://www.rabbitmq.com/parameters.html#parameter-management) was cleared,\r\n   nodes emitted an [internal event](https://www.rabbitmq.com/logging.html#internal-events) of the wrong type.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6538](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6538)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmq-queues grow` and `rabbitmq-queues shrink` misformatted the errors\r\n   they could encounter.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @gomoripeti (CloudAMQP).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6601](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6601)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Implicit `help` command (when CLI tools were invoked without a command name)\r\n   now respects all global flags (such as `--node`). For example, previously\r\n   the `--node` flag in\r\n\r\n   ``` shell\r\n   rabbitmqctl --node rabbit@ns1.rabbitmq.cluster.local\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   was ignored but now CLI tools would discover what plugins are enabled\r\n   on node `rabbit@ns1.rabbitmq.cluster.local` and include them into `help` output.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6598](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6598)\r\n\r\n * New key supported by `rabbitmqctl list_queues`: `effective_policy_definition` that returns\r\n   merged definitions of regular and [operator policies](https://www.rabbitmq.com/parameters.html#operator-policies) effective for the queue.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6556](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6556)\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * It is now possible to omit explicitly specifying queue type when declaring\r\n   a queue (or stream) in the management UI, and rely on the default queue type\r\n   configured for the selected virtual host.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6600](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6600)\r\n\r\n * New HTTP API endpoint, `GET /api/config/effective`, returns effective node configuration.\r\n   This is an HTTP API counterpart of `rabbitmq-diagnostics environment`.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge (AWS).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6016](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/6016)\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Flow control state for Shovels is now reported with higher fidelity\r\n   (of 1 second vs. several seconds previously). This means it should be easier\r\n   to spot Shovels that run into flow control using management UI.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @gomoripeti (CloudAMQP).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6615](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6615)\r\n\r\n### Sharding Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Plugin could fail to boot and halt node boot due to incorrect boot step\r\n   metadata.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#6583](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6583)\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * `ra` was upgraded [from `2.4.1` to `2.4.5`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.11.5.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.", "created_at": "2022-12-13T20:44:54Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.14.3", "tag_name": "v1.14.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.14.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul", "body": "## 1.14.3 (December 13, 2022)\r\n\r\nSECURITY:\r\n\r\n* Upgrade to use Go 1.19.4.

As routes using the cluster domain suffix are not exposed through Ingress, users will need to [configure DNS](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#configure-dns) in order to expose their services (most users probably already are). (#13259, @psschwei)\r\n- Upgrade HorizontalPodAutoscaler to autoscaling/v2 API version (#13337, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Services may now set `seccompProfile` in SecurityContext to allow users to comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standards best-practice (#13401, @evankanderson)\r\n- Bump min-version to k8s 1.23, so removing kind 1.22 testing (#13357, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Increase the outbound context deadline in reconcilers to 30s (from 10s) to match the maximum K8s webhook timeout. (#13323, @mattmoor)\r\n \r\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n- Add timeout handling in Activator  when processing a request for a revision (#13261, @nader-ziada)\r\n- EmptyDir volumes feature flag is now enabled by default (#13405, @dprotaso)\r\n- Save data from perf tests to create a dashboard. (#13192, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\n### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Knative services can now specify securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation (#13395, @mattmoor)\r\n- ConfigMap config-defaults property `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` now defaults to `revision-timeout-seconds`. This should unblock upgrades who set `revision-timeout-seconds` lower than the default value of 300 (#13255, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix LatestReadyRevision semantics so it only advances forward. When a Revision fails the Configuration & Route will no longer fall back to older revision. The exception is when you rollback to a Revision that is explicitly named.

This release is a new effort and is not related to a previous preview of code released in the [2.x-archive](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/2.x-archive) branch which was an experimental re-architecture of Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Server HTTP API and wire data formats *have not changed* for the 2.0.0 release. Eureka servers and clients should be backwards and forwards compatible over the wire. This release was primarily driven for compatibility with [Spring Framework 6.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga) and [Spring Boot 3.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/24/spring-boot-3-0-goes-ga) and the change to [Jakarta EE 9](https://jakarta.ee/release/9/).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\nThe Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API is not backwards compatible with 1.x.\r\nEureka 1.x included support for Jersey 1 and optional Support for Jersey 2. In many cases, Jersey 1 was the default and was baked into the `eureka-core` and `eureka-client` modules. Having a default client has been removed. The new `eureka-client-jersey3` and `eureka-core-jersey3` should now be used if no other implementation is provided (such as Spring Cloud support for a `RestTemplate` implementation).\r\nThe [`DiscoveryClient constructors`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/b03151940fe2a647bb0697bb0c6f1057f4db46e8/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java#L236-L279) have been updated to have a new required [`TransportClientFactories`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/2.x/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/shared/transport/jersey/TransportClientFactories.java) parameter. The majority of the Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API has remained unchanged.\r\nAll references to `javax.*` classes have been changed to `jakarta.*` classes and the appropriate modules have been added.\r\nThe `eureka-server-governator` module was removed. There is no current support for the JakartaEE version of `@Inject`.\r\nThe `eureka-server` module currently does not build a functional WAR file. The recommended way of creating a Eureka 2.0.0 server is via Spring Cloud Netflix as a Spring Boot application.\r\nThe build now requires JDK 11 because of some tests that require Jetty and the version of Jetty that supports Jakarta EE 9 requires Java 11. The build still targets Java 8.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease try things out and provide any feedback or issues at https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues.\r\n", "created_at":

Install/Upgrade Notes below before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\n> With the release of Rancher v2.7.0, several legacy features have been removed. See the Removed Legacy Features section below for details.\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Extensions\r\n\r\nRancher v2.7.0 introduces **extensions**. Admins may now make changes and enhancements to their UI functionality as desired independent of Rancher Manager releases. Using the Extensions catalog, which can be found at **\u2261 > Extensions**, the admin can view the list of installed extensions, update or roll back existing extensions, and install new extensions as desired. For more information on how to use Rancher extensions, please see the [docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions).\r\n\r\n### K3s Provisioning is GA (x86 Only)\r\n\r\nProvisioning K3s clusters on x86 clusters has graduated to GA! The fully compliant Kubernetes distribution is simplified, secure and at less than 60mb is perfect for Edge.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n- Support has ended for Kubernetes v1.20, v1.21, and v1.22.\r\n- The `Manage Cluster Members` and `Manage Project Members` roles have been updated to better align with common expectations regarding privilege escalation. Users in this role must now have any privilege they wish to assign to others. See [#122](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/pull/122).\r\n\r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- Cluster events are now displayed more prominently. See [#5816](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5816).\r\n- Added the ability to customize documentation links in the Rancher UI. See [#6294](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6294).\r\n- The Diagnostics page now shows more detailed information for troubleshooting performance issues. See [#6739](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6739).\r\n\r\n### New in Fleet\r\n\r\nAuthentication for OCI-based registries is now supported. Note that the structure of the [fleet.yaml](https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/single-cluster/helm-oci/fleet.yaml) is the same, and the credentials are provided as a Kubernetes secret which is described in the `Private Helm Repo` box in the [Repo Structure docs](https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-structure/).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- When deploying a RKE2/K3s custom cluster that uses a proxy, the registration now completes as expected. See [#39066](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39066).\r\n- When navigating to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Management page or Home page, the clusters now show up per the selected namespace as expected. See [#7213](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7213).\r\n- Kubernetes versions 1.24.x are no longer appearing as \"experimental\" when provisioning AKS clusters, as 1.24.x versions are fully supported for AKS clusters. See [#7217](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7217).\r\n- RKE v1.3.10-v1.3.13 in Rancher v2.6.7-v2.6.8 no longer removes user addons during an upgrade before redeploying them, which would cause issues with RKE1 cluster upgrades if user addons template has cattle-* or other system namespaces. See [#38749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38749).\r\n- Fixed an issue where user-defined EKS security groups were configured as the only node group security groups rather than being appended to the cluster default security group. See [#38014](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38014).\r\n- Fixed issue in which OPA Gatekeeper became stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n- Web socket disconnections no longer result in too many notifications. See [#6992](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6992).\r\n- CPU and memory usage are now displayed properly for EKS nodes. See [#4956](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4956).\r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Pods critical to running Rancher did not use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for its sidecar audit logging instead of busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. Rancher recommends admins to add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not be able to perform some of the actions within Azure AD, if the permissions are insufficient, so you may encounter errors.\r\n- For RKE2/K3s node driver clusters, when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app, the behavior has changed for pulling images. Previously, only the global container registry was used. As of this release, by default, if a private registry exists in the cluster config, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. To change the default registry, a custom registry can be specified during the Helm chart install/upgrade workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n- EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- In RKE1 clusters on Kubernetes v1.24, cadvisor `container` labels and metric series break Monitoring V2 dashboards. See [#38934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38934#issuecomment-1294585708) for a workaround and more details on the issue.\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\nSee the [Rancher v2.6.9 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.9) for previous behavior changes.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.0\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.6 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.12\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Kubernetes RKE1 1.24.x clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4; high CPU usage is also observed. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2022-11-16T16:10:32Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.25.4+k3s1", "tag_name": "v1.25.4+k3s1", "html_url": "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.25.4%2Bk3s1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rancher/k3s", "body": "<!-- v1.25.4+k3s1 -->\r\nThis release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.4, and fixes a number of issues.\r\n\r\nFor more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1253).\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.25.3+k3s1:\r\n\r\n* Add the gateway parameter in netplan [(#6292)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6292)\r\n* Bumped dynamiclistener library to v0.3.5 [(#6300)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6300)\r\n* Update kube-router to v1.5.1 with extra logging [(#6345)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6345)\r\n* Update maintainers [(#6298)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6298)\r\n* Bump testing to opensuse Leap 15.4 [(#6337)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6337)\r\n* Update E2E docs with more info on ubuntu 22.04 [(#6316)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6316)\r\n* Netpol test for podSelector & ingress [(#6247)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6247)\r\n* Bump all alpine images to 3.16 [(#6334)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6334)\r\n* Bump kine to v0.9.6 / sqlite3 v3.39.2 ([CVE-2022-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737)) [(#6317)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6317)\r\n* Add hardened cluster and upgrade tests [(#6320)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6320)\r\n* The bundled Traefik helm chart has been updated to v18.0.0 [(#6353)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6353)\r\n* Mark v1.25.3+k3s1 as stable [(#6338)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6338)\r\n* The embedded helm controller has been bumped to v0.13.0 [(#6294)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6294)\r\n* Fixed an issue that would prevent the deploy controller from handling manifests that include resource types that are no longer supported by the apiserver.

Now queries with sharding should work properly where the query looks like: `foo and without (lbl) bar`.\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n- [#5565](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5565) Receive: Allow remote write request limits to be defined per file and tenant (experimental).\r\n* [#5654](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5654) Query: add `--grpc-compression` flag that controls the compression used in gRPC client. With the flag it is now possible to compress the traffic between Query and StoreAPI nodes - you get lower network usage in exchange for a bit higher CPU/RAM usage.\r\n- [#5650](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5650) Query Frontend: Add sharded queries metrics. `thanos_frontend_sharding_middleware_queries_total` shows how many queries were sharded or not sharded.\r\n- [#5658](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5658) Query Frontend: Introduce new optional parameters (`query-range.min-split-interval`, `query-range.max-split-interval`, `query-range.horizontal-shards`) to implement more dynamic horizontal query splitting.\r\n- [#5721](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5721) Store: Add metric `thanos_bucket_store_empty_postings_total` for number of empty postings when fetching series.\r\n- [#5723](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5723) Compactor: Support disable block viewer UI.\r\n- [#5674](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5674) Query Frontend/Store: Add support connecting to redis using TLS.\r\n- [#5734](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5734) Store: Support disable block viewer UI.\r\n- [#5411](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5411) Tracing: Add OpenTelemetry Protocol exporter.\r\n- [#5779](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5779) Objstore: Support specifying S3 storage class.\r\n- [#5741](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5741) Query: add metrics on how much data is being selected by downstream Store APIs.\r\n- [#5673](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5673) Receive: Reload tenant limit configuration on file change.\r\n- [#5749](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5749) Query Frontend: Added small LRU cache to cache query analysis results.\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n\r\n- [#5738](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5738) Global: replace `crypto/sha256` with `minio/sha256-simd` to make hash calculation faster in metadata and reloader packages.\r\n- [#5648](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5648) Query Frontend: cache vertical shards in query-frontend.\r\n- [#5753](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5753) Build with Go 1.19.\r\n- [#5255](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5296) Query: Use k-way merging for the proxying logic.

CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#6303](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6303), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - Fix CVE-2022-27652 by dropping and refusing to add any inheritable capabilities ([#5770](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5770), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information. ([#5937](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5937), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where child processes of containers in the host's PID namespace appear to leak after the child exits ([#5977](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5977), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a panic caused by using the improper Result structure version when setting up CNI plugins ([#6320](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6320), [@juanfresia](https://github.com/juanfresia))\r\n - Revert fix for CVE-2022-27652 by re-adding inheritable capabilities. While there is a workaround, we believe this causes regression mid cycle with is contrary to CRI-O's backporting policy. The risk of the CVE is low, and so there is little risk in reverting here. ([#6168](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6168), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Update `cni_default_network` to not be commented by default in the output of `crio config` ([#5566](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5566), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Uncategorized\r\n - Fix a bug where a container is stuck in INIT because CRI-O believes it to be paused, and never updates the state ([#6143](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6143), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#6171](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6171), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a rare deadlock while communicating to systemd (RHBZ 2082344) ([#5961](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5961), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Use default umask `0o022` if CRI-O runs under a different umask value.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.
