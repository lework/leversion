This tool can import file and export file in P2P network. The solution is specifically engineered for high-speed read and write operations. This makes it particularly advantageous for scenarios involving large files, such as machine learning model checkpoints, where rapid, reliable access and distribution across the network are critical for training and inference workflows. By leveraging P2P distribution and persistent caching, dfcache significantly reduces I/O bottlenecks and accelerates the lifecycle of large data assets.\r\n\r\n![p1](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p1.webp)\r\n\r\nFor documentation on how to use the dfcache command-line tool, please refer to the following link: <https://d7y.io/docs/next/reference/commands/client/dfcache/>\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ dfcache import /tmp/file.txt\r\n\u28f7 Done: 2229733261\r\n```\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ dfcache export 2229733261 -O /tmp/file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n![p2](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p2.webp)\r\n\r\n### Resource Search (Tasks and Persistent Cache Tasks)\r\n\r\nThe Resource Search feature enables seamless querying of tasks, including files, images, and persistent cache tasks. It optimizes resource access, improving task management and retrieval efficiency.\r\n\r\n![p3](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p3.webp)\r\n\r\n### Vortex: A P2P File Transfer Protocol Based on TLV\r\n\r\nVortex protocol is a high-performance peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer protocol implementation in Rust, designed as part of the Dragonfly project. It utilizes the TLV (Tag-Length-Value) format for efficient and flexible data transmission, making it ideal for large-scale file distribution scenarios.\r\nPacket Format:\r\n\r\n- Packet Identifier (8 bits): Uniquely identifies each packet\r\n- Tag (8 bits): Specifies data type in value field\r\n- Length (32 bits): Indicates Value field length, up to 4 GiB\r\n- Value (variable): Actual data content, maximum 1 GiB\r\n  Protocol Format:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|                            |                   |                    |                         |\r\n| Packet Identifier (8 bits) |    Tag (8 bits)   |  Length (32 bits)  |   Value (up to 4 GiB)   |\r\n|                            |                   |                    |                         |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [Vortex Protocol](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/vortex/blob/main/docs/README.md).\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Large File Distribution\r\n\r\nThis release significantly enhances Dragonfly's large file distribution capabilities, delivering improved efficiency and performance. We've revamped our scheduling algorithms for large file scenarios to ensure smarter resource and task allocation. Additionally, new mechanisms now more effectively balance the load across peers during large file transfers. Optimizations to the peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol and network transport layers further boost transmission efficiency.\r\n\r\nThese improvements include performance optimizations for both [Client](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/client) and [Scheduler](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly). You can find more details in the project's pull request.\r\n\r\n### Support scopes for Personal Access Tokens (PATs)\r\n\r\nBy enabling users to define specific access rights (scopes) for each PAT, we significantly enhance the security of Open API interactions. Instead of granting broad permissions, PATs can now be limited to only the necessary privileges required for a particular integration or task.\r\n\r\n![p4](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p4.webp)\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Preheating\r\n\r\n#### Implement Distributed Rate Limiting for Preheating Tasks\r\n\r\nBy limiting the rate at which preheating requests are initiated across the distributed system, it prevents excessive preheating activities from stressing the origin. This enhancement ensures a more stable preheating.\r\n\r\n![p5](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p5.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Support to set piece length for preheating\r\n\r\nBy allowing adjustment of the piece size, users can optimize data transfer efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving large files.\r\n\r\n![p6](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p6.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Flexible Preheating: Set Peer scope by Percentage or Count\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances preheating capabilities by allowing users to specify the preheating scope more precisely.\r\n\r\n![p7](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p7.webp)\r\n\r\n### Implement Audit Logging for User Operations\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces comprehensive audit logging capabilities to track user operations within the system. Audit logs will record critical actions performed by users, such as initiating preheating tasks, deleting task caches, and other significant system interactions.\r\n\r\n![p8](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p8.webp)\r\n\r\n### Garbage Collection\r\n\r\nDragonfly supports Garbage Collection (GC) Audit Logs and GC Job Records to track and manage garbage collection activities. The Manager enables automated GC retention, allowing records to be preserved for a configurable time period. Additionally, it provides the capability to manually trigger forced GC operations as needed.\r\n\r\nThis feature ensures efficient monitoring and management of GC processes, offering flexibility through automated retention policies and manual intervention for immediate GC execution.\r\n\r\n![p9](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p9.webp)\r\n\r\n### Optimized File Download with Hard Link\r\n\r\nFile download needs to be done in a way that is efficient and secure. If users are downloading a large file, it is not efficient to download the file and copy to the output path. Instead, we can create a hard link to the file and send the link to the user. This way, we can avoid copying the file and save time and resources. If hard link fails (e.g. due to different file systems), dfdaemon will fallback to copying the file.\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [file download workflow](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/design/blob/main/systems-analysis/file-download-workflow-with-hard-link/README.md).\r\n\r\n### Hardware Acceleration for Piece Hash Computation\r\n\r\nThis feature enables hardware-accelerated Piece hash computation, significantly boosting performance and efficiency. By utilizing specialized hardware, the hash computation process is accelerated, allowing faster processing of large file.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Storage Management\r\n\r\n#### Disk Space Validation for Operations\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances the client's storage functionality by implementing disk space validation. When insufficient disk space is detected, the client will return a failure response, preventing potential data corruption or incomplete operations.\r\n\r\n#### Disk Garbage Collection Management\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances Peer's disk management by introducing configurable garbage collection (GC) thresholds based on disk usage. The distThreshold parameter allows users to define a specific disk capacity (e.g., 10TiB) as the base for calculating GC trigger points. If set, the distHighThresholdPercent (e.g., 80%) and distLowThresholdPercent (e.g., 60%) are applied relative to this capacity. If distThreshold is not provided or set to 0, these percentages are calculated based on the total actual disk space. When disk usage exceeds the high threshold, Dragonfly triggers GC(LRU) to reclaim space; GC stops when usage falls below the low threshold. This enables efficient management of a logical disk portion for caching, improving resource utilization and system performance.\r\n\r\n![p10](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p10.webp)\r\n\r\n### Support for OpenTelemetry Tracing\r\n\r\nDragonfly supports for tracing based on OpenTelemetry, covering the Manager, Scheduler, and Peers. This enables end-to-end visibility into the download process, allowing users to query detailed information, such as overall download latency, using a specific task ID. The integration ensures efficient monitoring and performance analysis across the entire system.\r\n\r\nAdd tracing configuration as follows(in Manager, Scheduler and Peer):\r\n\r\n![p11](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p11.webp)\r\n\r\nYou can access the Jaeger UI to visualize the traces.\r\n\r\n![p12](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p12.webp)\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [Tracing](https://d7y.io/docs/next/operations/best-practices/observability/tracing/).\r\n\r\n## Security Enhancements\r\n\r\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the [CNCF TAG Security](https://tag-security.cncf.io/) for their collaboration on a joint security audit. Their expertise and thorough review were invaluable in helping us identify areas for security improvement within Dragonfly.\r\nFor detailed information on the specific security issues addressed and the corresponding fixes, please refer to the following issue: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/issues/3811>\r\n\r\n## Nydus\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n- nydusify copy: support chunked upload and retry mechanisms to handle large image blobs.\r\n- nydusify check: refactor to support OCI v1 and nydus format images as both source and target.\r\n- nydusd: support chunk-level CRC data validation for image data consistency.\r\n\r\n## Significant bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed memory leaks and file descriptor leaks caused by `sysinfo` library.\r\n- Cleans up the Unix domain socket (UDS) to prevent dfdaemon startup crashes.\r\n- Prevent client from repeatedly downloading the same piece from multiple parents.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\nYou can see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.\r\n", "created_at": "2025-07-01T09:16:22Z", "project": "Dragonfly", "repo": "dragonflyoss/dragonfly", "type": "Image Distribution", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.3.0", "tag_name": "v2.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly", "body": "# Dragonfly v2.3.0 is released!\r\n\r\nDragonfly v2.3.0 is released! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Thanks the [contributors](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/graphs/contributors) who made this release happend and welcome you to visit [d7y.io](https://d7y.io) website.\r\n\r\n![dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/dragonfly-linear.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Persistent Cache Task\r\n\r\nIt designs to provide persistent caching for tasks.

Instead of granting broad permissions, PATs can now be limited to only the necessary privileges required for a particular integration or task.\r\n\r\n![p4](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p4.webp)\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Preheating\r\n\r\n#### Implement Distributed Rate Limiting for Preheating Tasks\r\n\r\nBy limiting the rate at which preheating requests are initiated across the distributed system, it prevents excessive preheating activities from stressing the origin. This enhancement ensures a more stable preheating.\r\n\r\n![p5](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p5.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Support to set piece length for preheating\r\n\r\nBy allowing adjustment of the piece size, users can optimize data transfer efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving large files.\r\n\r\n![p6](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p6.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Flexible Preheating: Set Peer scope by Percentage or Count\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances preheating capabilities by allowing users to specify the preheating scope more precisely.\r\n\r\n![p7](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p7.webp)\r\n\r\n### Implement Audit Logging for User Operations\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces comprehensive audit logging capabilities to track user operations within the system. Audit logs will record critical actions performed by users, such as initiating preheating tasks, deleting task caches, and other significant system interactions.\r\n\r\n![p8](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p8.webp)\r\n\r\n### Garbage Collection\r\n\r\nDragonfly supports Garbage Collection (GC) Audit Logs and GC Job Records to track and manage garbage collection activities. The Manager enables automated GC retention, allowing records to be preserved for a configurable time period. Additionally, it provides the capability to manually trigger forced GC operations as needed.\r\n\r\nThis feature ensures efficient monitoring and management of GC processes, offering flexibility through automated retention policies and manual intervention for immediate GC execution.\r\n\r\n![p9](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p9.webp)\r\n\r\n### Optimized File Download with Hard Link\r\n\r\nFile download needs to be done in a way that is efficient and secure. If users are downloading a large file, it is not efficient to download the file and copy to the output path. Instead, we can create a hard link to the file and send the link to the user. This way, we can avoid copying the file and save time and resources. If hard link fails (e.g. due to different file systems), dfdaemon will fallback to copying the file.\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [file download workflow](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/design/blob/main/systems-analysis/file-download-workflow-with-hard-link/README.md).\r\n\r\n### Hardware Acceleration for Piece Hash Computation\r\n\r\nThis feature enables hardware-accelerated Piece hash computation, significantly boosting performance and efficiency. By utilizing specialized hardware, the hash computation process is accelerated, allowing faster processing of large file.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Storage Management\r\n\r\n#### Disk Space Validation for Operations\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances the client's storage functionality by implementing disk space validation. When insufficient disk space is detected, the client will return a failure response, preventing potential data corruption or incomplete operations.\r\n\r\n#### Disk Garbage Collection Management\r\n\r\nThis feature enhances Peer's disk management by introducing configurable garbage collection (GC) thresholds based on disk usage. The distThreshold parameter allows users to define a specific disk capacity (e.g., 10TiB) as the base for calculating GC trigger points. If set, the distHighThresholdPercent (e.g., 80%) and distLowThresholdPercent (e.g., 60%) are applied relative to this capacity. If distThreshold is not provided or set to 0, these percentages are calculated based on the total actual disk space. When disk usage exceeds the high threshold, Dragonfly triggers GC(LRU) to reclaim space; GC stops when usage falls below the low threshold. This enables efficient management of a logical disk portion for caching, improving resource utilization and system performance.\r\n\r\n![p10](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p10.webp)\r\n\r\n### Support for OpenTelemetry Tracing\r\n\r\nDragonfly supports for tracing based on OpenTelemetry, covering the Manager, Scheduler, and Peers. This enables end-to-end visibility into the download process, allowing users to query detailed information, such as overall download latency, using a specific task ID. The integration ensures efficient monitoring and performance analysis across the entire system.\r\n\r\nAdd tracing configuration as follows(in Manager, Scheduler and Peer):\r\n\r\n![p11](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p11.webp)\r\n\r\nYou can access the Jaeger UI to visualize the traces.\r\n\r\n![p12](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/releases/2.3.0/images/p12.webp)\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [Tracing](https://d7y.io/docs/next/operations/best-practices/observability/tracing/).\r\n\r\n## Security Enhancements\r\n\r\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the [CNCF TAG Security](https://tag-security.cncf.io/) for their collaboration on a joint security audit. Their expertise and thorough review were invaluable in helping us identify areas for security improvement within Dragonfly.\r\nFor detailed information on the specific security issues addressed and the corresponding fixes, please refer to the following issue: <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/issues/3811>\r\n\r\n## Nydus\r\n\r\n### New features and enhancements\r\n- nydusify copy: support chunked upload and retry mechanisms to handle large image blobs.\r\n- nydusify check: refactor to support OCI v1 and nydus format images as both source and target.\r\n- nydusd: support chunk-level CRC data validation for image data consistency.\r\n\r\n## Significant bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed memory leaks and file descriptor leaks caused by `sysinfo` library.\r\n- Cleans up the Unix domain socket (UDS) to prevent dfdaemon startup crashes.\r\n- Prevent client from repeatedly downloading the same piece from multiple parents.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\nYou can see

Notably:\r\n\r\n- Improvements to the OPA website and documentation\r\n- Allowing keywords in Rego references\r\n- Parallel test execution\r\n- Faster built-in function execution\r\n\r\n### Modernized OPA Website ([#7037](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7037))\r\n\r\nWe're continuing to modernize the OPA website with a new design and improved user experience.\r\n\r\nSome highlights:\r\n\r\n- [Builtins](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-reference#built-in-functions): You can now search them on the docs page!\r\n- Sidebar redesign: Making it easier to find what you're looking for in our docs\r\n- Feedback forms: Closing the feedback loop between docs authors and readers -- Please let us know if you dislike, or like, a docs page.\r\n- [Downloads page](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs#1-download-opa): Find your OS' installation instructions on a less cluttered page!\r\n- And much more\r\n\r\nAuthored by @sky3n3t and @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Allowing keywords in Rego references ([#7709](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7709))\r\n\r\nPreviously, Rego references could not contain terms that conflict with Rego keywords such as `package`, `if`, `else`, `not`, etc.\r\nin certain constructs:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\nallow if {\r\n    input.package.source         # not allowed (before v1.6.0)\r\n    input[\"package\"].destination # allowed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe constraints for valid Rego references have been relaxed to allow keywords.\r\nThe above example is now valid and will no longer cause a compilation error.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @johanfylling\r\n\r\n### Parallel Test Execution ([#7442](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7442))\r\n\r\nBy default, OPA will now run tests in parallel (defaulting to one parallel execution thread per available CPU core), significantly speeding up test execution time for large test suites.\r\nThe performance boost is closely tied to the number of tests in your project and your selected parallelism level. For larger projects and default settings, 2-3x performance gains have been measured on a MacBook Pro. \r\n\r\nParallelism can be disabled to run tests sequentially by setting the `--parallel` flag to `1`.

Such conflicts are ambiguous and can lead to unexpected evaluation results, and should be resolved.\r\n- cmd/inspect: Fixing missing annotations location in `opa inspect` with JSON format ([#7459](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7459)) authored by @johanfylling reported by @mostealth\r\n- cmd/parse: Expose `--v0-compatible` flag ([#7668](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7668)) authored by @tsandall\r\n- cmd/refactor: Fix src:dst parsing to deal with colons ([#7648](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7648)) authored by @tsandall\r\n- metrics: Fix restartable timer bug.

issues with authentication caused by the AD FS Relying Party Trust not being able to pick up a signature verification certificate from the metadata, that requires manual intervention. This can be corrected by either trying to update Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...) or by directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate). For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE/RKE1) will reach end of life on **July 31, 2025**. Rancher 2.12.0 and later will no longer support provisioning or managing downstream RKE1 clusters. We recommend replatforming RKE1 clusters to RKE2 to ensure continued support and security updates. Learn more about the transition [here](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021518).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** [Rancher-Istio](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/istio) will be deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the [SUSE Application Collection](https://apps.rancher.io) build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in [this announcement](https://forums.suse.com/t/deprecation-of-rancher-istio/45043)\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Review the Install/Upgrade Notes before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\nRancher v2.11.3 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community and Prime version release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes. To learn more about Rancher Prime, see our page on the [Rancher Prime Platform](https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher-platform).\r\n\r\nFor more information on new features in the general minor release see the [v2.11.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.0).\r\n\r\n## Changes Since v2.11.2\r\n\r\nSee the full list of [changes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/compare/v2.11.2...v2.11.3).\r\n\r\n## Virtualization Management (Harvester)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where error messages are not displayed in the UI when using the Harvester UI Extension. See [#14363](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/14363).\r\n\r\n## RKE2/K3s Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Encryption Key Rotation feature is re-enabled on K3s/RKE2 versions included with this release. Please upgrade any clusters running versions affected by [#8236](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8236) (1.32.4, 1.31.8, or 1.30.12) to 1.32.5+, 1.31.9+, or 1.30.13+.\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n## Expected Changes in Image Artifacts\r\n\r\nImage artifact digests are expected to be renamed in Rancher v2.12.0, v2.11.4 and v2.10.8. Up until this change, separate image digests files for each operating system and architecture have been maintained for compatibility reasons. With this change, only one file for each operating system is to be provided:\r\n\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-linux-amd64.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-linux-arm64.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-linux.txt`.\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2019.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2022.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-windows.txt`.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.11.3\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.11.3](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.11.3)\r\n- RKE - [v1.8.4](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.8.4)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.32.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.31.9\r\n- v1.30.13\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.32.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.31.9\r\n- v1.30.13\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.28 and v1.29 are no longer supported. Before upgrading to Rancher v2.11.0, ensure all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.30 or later. See [#48628](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48628).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Replaced instances of v-tooltip with v-clean-tooltip to fix an issue where the UI did not sanitize cluster description inputs, allowing the possibility of changes to a cluster (local or downstream) description to cause a stored XSS attack. For more information, see [CVE-2024-52281](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-2v2w-8v8c-wcm9) and [#12564](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12564).\r\n  - The v2.11.0 release removed the data collection feature, which removed the [Rancher legacy telemetry](https://github.com/rancher/telemetry) and the subsequent `Opt-out of Telemetry` setting during set-up. Part of the legacy telemetry has been replaced with the SCC registration process for Prime, and the most important deployment metric is still tracked via the `system-charts` registry analysis. Going forward, telemetry will be gathered SUSE-wide. For more information, see [#12639](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12639).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Generic Kubernetes imported clusters now use the v3 management cluster object (`cluster.management.cattle.io`) for both the initial creation and the updates (POST and PUT API calls respectively). See [#13151](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/13151).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2/K3s Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - etcd snapshots are now populated to Rancher by listing the `etcdsnapshotfile.k3s.cattle.io` resources in the downstream cluster instead of periodically scraping the CLI and `rke2/k3s-etcd-snapshots` configmap. See [#44452](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44452#issuecomment-2762057052).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - CLI commands corresponding to the multi-cluster app legacy feature are no longer available. See [#48252](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48252).\r\n  - The deprecated subcommand `globaldns` was removed from the Rancher CLI. See [#48129](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48129).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - The `Restricted Admin` role has been removed. Existing users with the `Restricted Admin` role will have privileges associated with this role revoked upon upgrade. See [#47875](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/47875).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Continuous Delivery (Fleet)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - Fleet now honors custom certificate authority (CA) bundles [configured](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.11/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/helm-chart-options#additional-trusted-cas) in Rancher.\r\n\r\n    This prevents you from needing to copy your CA bundles to all `GitRepos` and/or Helm secrets referenced by those `GitRepos`. Instead, you can configure those bundles directly through a single secret already known by Rancher, which Fleet will transparently use as a fallback option.\r\n\r\n    See the [Fleet documentation](https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-add#using-custom-ca-bundles) and [fleet#2750](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/2750).\r\n\r\n  - Since the move from StatefulSet to a Deployment and the introduction of leader election for the agents, agent failover has improved. When failover has been tested by shutting down a node with a fleet agent, we observed the pods from that node to stay in the `terminating` state. We want to make sure that it is clear to our users, that this is not a problem of Fleet, nor is it Fleet related. This is how Kubernetes behaves when the node becomes unreachable. Failover works correctly, even if those pods are kept in the `terminating` state. See [fleet#3096](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/3096) and [kubernetes/kubernetes#72226](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72226).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - The Catalog v1, Multi-Cluster App (MCA) legacy feature has been removed. If upgrading from a previous Rancher version to v2.11 then the MCA associated CRD's and their instances will still exist in the cluster and can be manually deleted by using the following command:\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    kubectl delete crds catalogs.management.cattle.io catalogtemplates.management.cattle.io catalogtemplateversions.management.cattle.io templates.management.cattle.io templateversions.management.cattle.io templatecontents.management.cattle.io clustercatalogs.management.cattle.io projectcatalogs.management.cattle.io multiclusterapps.management.cattle.io multiclusterapprevisions.management.cattle.io apps.project.cattle.io apprevisions.project.cattle.io\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.11.0:**\r\n  - `rancher-alerting-drivers` app now uses `rancher/kuberlr-kubectl`, improving how alerts are sent and received. See [#48849](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48849).\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#13655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/13655).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - After deleting a Namespace or Project in the Rancher UI, the Namespace or Project remains visible. As a workaround, refresh the page. See [#12220](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12220).\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2:**\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Virtualization Management (Harvester)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n  ", "created_at": "2025-06-25T22:28:14Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3.2.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/influxdata/influxdb/commits/1ca3168beee35b22fe62a3998cd3ed0d4ab65ac6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/influxdata/influxDb", "body": "chore: update version in Cargo.toml to 3.2.0 (#26563)", "created_at": "2025-06-25T17:29:29Z", "project": "InfluxDb", "repo": "influxdata/influxDb", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "3.0.2(June 25th, 2025)", "tag_name": "3.0.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases/tag/3.0.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos", "body": "This version is mainly fix some bugs found in 3.0.1 and 3.0.0.

have been merged into a single new package: `mfsgui`.\r\n  * This package replaces both legacy packages and should be used going forward.\r\n\r\n* **Dedicated GUI Server (C-based)**\r\n\r\n  * The GUI server has been rewritten from a Python script to a native C binary.\r\n  * **User-visible changes:**\r\n\r\n    * New configuration file: `/etc/mfs/mfsgui.cfg` (replaces embedded config in `index.html`).\r\n    * Faster chart loading.\r\n\r\n* **GUI Refactor**\r\n\r\n  * Interface improvements: tab merging, table layout enhancements, and general usability polishing.\r\n\r\n* **Prometheus Metrics Support**\r\n\r\n  * The GUI now exposes metrics in Prometheus-compatible format.\r\n\r\n### CLI Refactor\r\n\r\n  * Internally restructured into multiple Python files for maintainability.\r\n  * No change in user-facing CLI behavior.\r\n\r\n### Daemon and Master Server Enhancements\r\n\r\n* **Fixed Lock Handling in Master Server**\r\n\r\n  * Resolved a bug related to improper freeing of waiting locks in certain rare operation sequences.\r\n\r\n* **Poll Safety in Daemons**\r\n\r\n  * Added a conditional guard to skip socket handling when poll returns zero \u2013 a rare edge case but handled defensively.\r\n\r\n* **Corrected OOM Killer Disabling**\r\n\r\n  * Fixed an issue in how daemons attempted to disable the Linux OOM killer; prior implementation misinterpreted error codes.\r\n  * Fix inspired by a user question on [GitHub Discussions #669](https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs/discussions/669).\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n- Replaced potentially unsafe `sprintf()` call to eliminate compiler warnings (especially on macOS)\r\n  - This change is technical and does not affect user-facing behavior.\r\n\r\nAs always, we encourage users to upgrade for improved stability, maintainability, and performance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPiotr \u2022 MooseFS Team", "created_at": "2025-06-16T13:06:53Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type":

Packer now uses the `-File` operator to run PowerShell scripts by default. As part of this update, Packer prepends certain preamble logic to the script before adding your script content.\r\n\r\nThe default command now looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npowershell -executionpolicy <execution_policy> -file {{.Path}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `{{.Path}}` refers to the path of the temporary script file generated by Packer. When using the script or scripts block, Packer injects the preamble logic at the top of this script file.\r\n\r\nIf your script relies on specific PowerShell constructs (such as module imports, parameter declarations, or function definitions) that must appear at the top of the script, we recommend wrapping your script content inside a function and invoking it. This helps avoid any conflicts or ordering issues introduced by the preamble logic.\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-06-06T07:32:19Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type":

[#13758](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13758)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue commit map operation order was Erlang-version specific,\r\n   potentially leading to confusing inconsistencies between replica behaviors.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14025](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/14025)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue failed to recover from a rare timeout during cluster

[#13782](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/13782)\r\n\r\n * `GET /api/health/checks/ready-to-serve-clients` is a new health check\r\n   that responds a 200 OK if the target node is ready to serve clients\r\n   (booted, not above the connection limit, not in [maintenance mode](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade#maintenance-mode)).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue:

operator in a local environment and leverage on solutions such as VS Code Remote Containers and GitHub Codespaces to have a consistent development environment. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, new GitHub Actions are available to ensure better quality of their code. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, controllers now use `.Named(\"<Kind>\")` in  `SetupWithManager` to prevent naming conflicts in multi-group projects. ([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4162)). ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a new Makefile target named `lint-config` has been added to verify that your `.golangci.yaml` configuration file is valid. This helps catch issues early when customizing lint rules.\n([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4462)). ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- For ALL-based operators, scaffolded resources now include the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label to support Kubernetes best practices for app identification. ([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4437/files)). ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- For ALL-based operators, new role manifests are now scaffolded under the `config/rbac/` directory to assist cluster administrators. For each API defined in the project, three role files are generated: `<kind>_admin_role.yaml`, `<kind>_editor_role.yaml`, and `<kind>_viewer_role.yaml`.\nThese roles are not applied by default. Instead, they are provided as helpers, allowing cluster administrators to customize and apply appropriate permissions as needed.\nThe primary motivation for scaffolding these roles is to simplify integration with Kubernetes' aggregated roles mechanism. By including annotations such as `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: \"true\"`, `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: \"true\"`, and `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: \"true\"`, these role definitions can automatically contribute permissions to the default admin, edit, and view roles in a cluster when applied.\nFor more information on Kubernetes RBAC and aggregated roles, see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/.

([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n\n### Changes\n\n- The bundle build target now respects the CONTAINER_TOOL variable, allowing users to use alternative container tools like podman instead of docker. ([#6932](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6932))\n- For All-based Operators, upgrade OPM to version from `v1.23.0` to `v1.55.0`, which includes several bug fixes and  improvements. For further information, see: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases. ([#6953](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6953))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based Operators, the `main.go` file has been enhanced to support real TLS certificates for both webhooks and the metrics server, with automated certificate rotation via cert-manager. This change improves security and aligns with production-grade best practices.\nPreviously, setups relied on kube-rbac-proxy (deprecated in Operator SDK and Kubebuilder, see: [kubebuilder/discussions/3907](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/discussions/3907)), which generated TLS certificates dynamically \u2014 a method no longer recommended for secure environments. The updated approach adopts static certificates managed by cert-manager.\nAdditionally, integrations with Prometheus now support scraping metrics using the cert-manager generated certificates. A related fix was introduced to ensure that CA injection patches are only applied to CRDs with a conversion webhook, avoiding unnecessary annotations.\nTo support these improvements, changes to `config/default/kustomization.yaml` are required. These include: configuring webhook and metrics server certificates, enabling Prometheus scraping with TLS, and correcting CA injection behavior.\nThese updates also introduce flexible opt-in mechanisms, allowing users to selectively enable or disable: - TLS for the metrics server via cert-manager - TLS for webhooks via cert-manager - TLS configuration for Prometheus scraping\nTogether, these changes are part of a broader effort to elevate the default security posture and configurability of Go-based operators. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a fix has been implemented to ensure that the Prometheus configuration can properly scrape metrics from the operator's metrics server when TLS is enabled. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a fix has been implemented to ensure that CA injection patches are applied only to CRDs that define a conversion webhook.\nPreviously, the CA injection patch logic was overly broad \u2014 applying injection annotations to all CRDs whenever a webhook was scaffolded with the `--conversion` flag. This behavior was introduced in Kubebuilder release `v3.5.0` when replacements were introduced in place of legacy vars and the `kustomize/v2-alpha` plugin was adopted.\nThe incorrect behavior likely went unnoticed due to incomplete support for conversion webhooks in earlier versions. This release addresses that gap, enabling proper scaffolding and CA injection behavior specifically for CRDs with conversion webhooks.\nTo support this improvement, a new marker has been introduced: `+kubebuilder:scaffold:crdkustomizecainjectionns`. This marker ensures that the correct replacements are generated in `config/default/kustomization.yaml` for CA injection. Additionally, the `kubebuilder:scaffold:crdkustomizewebhookpatch` marker was created to ensure that the webhook patch is only applied to CRDs that have a conversion webhook in the `config/crd/kustomization.yaml` file.\nFor more information on this and other scaffolding markers, refer to the official Kubebuilder documentation: https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers/scaffold. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, ENVTEST version management is now automated by  deriving values from `go.mod`, and controller tests now locate binaries dynamically.  ([More info](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/4401))\nThese updates improve the developer experience by: - Reducing manual configuration for ENVTEST. - Ensuring IDEs or test runners can locate the binaries reliably. - Making controller test scaffolding more robust and portable. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, updated GolangCI-Lint configuration to replace  the deprecated `exportloopref` linter with the `copyloopvar` linter. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- (go/v4) For Go-based operators, upgraded project scaffolding to Go 1.23,  Kubernetes v0.32.1, and controller-runtime v0.20.4.\nThe default project scaffolding for Go-based operators has been updated to use:\n  - **Go 1.23**\n  - **Kubernetes modules v0.32.1**\n  - **controller-runtime v0.20.4**\n  - **Ginkgo v2.22.0** and **Gomega v1.36.1**. ([#6928](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6928))\n- **Breaking change**: (go/v4) For Go-based operators, upgraded controller-runtime from `v0.19.4` to `v0.20.0` and added support for Kubernetes 1.32.  Removed deprecated `webhook.Validator` and `webhook.Defaulter` interfaces from the runtime. Webhooks should no longer reside under the `api/` directory\u2014this has been the default behavior since Kubebuilder rlease [v4.3.0)(https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v4.3.0). \nA `--legacy=true` flag was added to support scaffolding webhooks in the old layout when needed.

Key highlights include V2 Data Engine improvements, orphaned instance deletion, offline replica rebuilding, recurring system backups, and enhanced observability of Longhorn resources.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorn team appreciates your contributions and anticipates receiving feedback regarding this release.\r\n\r\nFor terminology and background on Longhorn releases, see [Releases](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).\r\n\r\n## Warning\r\n\r\nThe longhorn-manager v1.9.0 is impacted by a [regression issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11016), which causes failures of recurring jobs. To resolve this issue, replace `longhorn-manager:v1.9.0` with the hotfixed image `longhorn-manager:v1.9.0-hotfix-1`.\r\n\r\nYou can apply the update by following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Disable the upgrade version check**\r\n   - Helm users: Set `upgradeVersionCheck` to `false` in the `values.yaml` file.\r\n   - Manifest users: Remove the `--upgrade-version-check` flag from the deployment manifest.\r\n\r\n2. **Update the `longhorn-manager` image**\r\n   - Change the image tag from `v1.9.0` to `v1.9.0-hotfix-1` in the appropriate file:\r\n     - For Helm: Update `values.yaml`\r\n     - For manifests: Update the deployment manifest directly.\r\n\r\n3. **Proceed with the upgrade**\r\n   - Apply the changes using your standard Helm upgrade command or reapply the updated manifest.\r\n\r\n## Removal\r\n\r\n### Environment Check Script\r\n\r\nThe `environment_check.sh` script, deprecated in v1.7.0, has been removed in v1.9.0. Use the [Longhorn Command Line Tool](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/advanced-resources/longhornctl/) (`longhornctl`) to check your environment for potential issues.\r\n\r\n### Orphan Resource Auto-Deletion\r\n\r\nThe `orphan-auto-deletion` setting has been replaced by `orphan-resource-auto-deletion` in v1.9.0. To replicate the previous behavior, include `replica-data` in the `orphan-resource-auto-deletion` value. During the upgrade, the original `orphan-auto-deletion` setting is automatically migrated.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [Orphan Data Cleanup](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/advanced-resources/data-cleanup/).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Fields in `longhorn.io/v1beta2` CRDs\r\n\r\nDeprecated fields have been removed from the CRDs. For details, see issue [#6684](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6684).\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n### `longhorn.io/v1beta1` API\r\n\r\nThe `v1beta1` version of the Longhorn API is marked unserved and unsupported in v1.9.0 and will be removed in v1.10.0.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #10250](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10250).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Change in V2 Backing Image\r\n\r\nStarting with Longhorn v1.9.0, V2 backing images are incompatible with earlier versions due to naming conflicts in the extended attributes (`xattrs`) used by SPDK backing image logical volumes. As a result, V2 backing images must be deleted and recreated during the upgrade process. Since backing images cannot be deleted while volumes using them still exist, you must first back up, delete, and later restore those volumes as the following steps:\r\n\r\n- Before upgrading to v1.9.0:\r\n  - Verify that backup targets are functioning properly.\r\n  - Create full backups of all volumes that use a V2 backing image.\r\n  - Detach and delete these volumes after the backups complete.\r\n  - In the **Backing Image** page, save the specifications of all V2 backing images, including the name and the image source.\r\n  - Delete all V2 backing images.\r\n- After upgrading:\r\n  - Recreate the V2 backing images using the same names and image sources.\r\n  - Restore the volumes from your backups.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #10805](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10805).\r\n\r\n## Primary Highlights\r\n\r\n### New V2 Data Engine Features\r\n\r\nWhile the V2 Data Engine remains experimental in this release, several core functions have been significantly improved:\r\n\r\n- [Support UBLK Frontend](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9719): Support for UBLK frontend in the V2 Data Engine, which allows for better performance and resource utilization.\r\n- [Storage Network](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6450): Introduces support for storage networks in the V2 Data Engine to allow network segregation.\r\n- [Offline Replica Rebuilding](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8443): Support for offline replica rebuilding, which allows degraded volumes to automatically recover replicas even while the volume is detached. This capability ensures high data availability without manual intervention.\r\n\r\n### Recurring System Backup\r\n\r\nStarting with Longhorn v1.9.0, you can create a recurring job for system backup creation.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/advanced-resources/system-backup-restore/backup-longhorn-system/) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6534)\r\n\r\n### Offline Replica Rebuilding\r\n\r\nLonghorn introduces offline replica rebuilding, a feature that allows degraded volumes to automatically recover replicas even while the volume is detached. This capability minimizes the need for manual recovery steps, accelerates restoration, and ensures high data availability. By default, offline replica rebuilding is disabled. To enable it, set the `offline-replica-rebuilding` setting to `true` in the Longhorn UI or CLI.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/advanced-resources/rebuilding/offline-replica-rebuilding/) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/8443)\r\n\r\n### Orphaned Instance Deletion\r\n\r\nLonghorn can now track and remove orphaned instances, which are leftover resources like replicas or engines that are no longer associated with an active volume. These instances may accumulate due to unexpected failures or incomplete cleanup.\r\n\r\nTo reduce resource usage and maintain system performance, Longhorn supports both automatic and manual cleanup. By default, this feature is disabled. To enable it, set the `orphan-resource-auto-deletion` setting to `instance` in the Longhorn UI or CLI.\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/advanced-resources/data-cleanup/orphaned-instance-cleanup/) | [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6764)\r\n\r\n### Improved Metrics for Replica, Engine, and Rebuild Status\r\n\r\nLonghorn improves observability with new Prometheus metrics that expose the status and identity of Replica and Engine CRs, along with rebuild activity. These metrics make it easier to monitor rebuilds across the cluster.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [#10550](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10550) and [#10722](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10722).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before installing Longhorn v1.9.0.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.9.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.8.x to v1.9.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions.

Significant kOps features will instead target kOps 1.33.\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes minor version upgrades to 1.31 or later should be performed using the `kops reconcile cluster command.\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.31 introduced stricter checks around the version-skew policy. While kOps has always followed the version-skew policy, there was an edge case:\r\nnodes that were added by an autoscaler during a rolling-update would not always follow the version-skew policy.\r\nWe recommend trying the new kops reconcile command, see [docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/tutorial/upgrading-kubernetes.md) for more details.\r\nThe `kops reconcile` functionality was introduced in kOps 1.32.\r\n\r\n* flannel is no longer planned to be removed and has been updated to v0.26.4.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.26 is deprecated and is removed in kOps 1.32.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.27 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.33.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Don't

configuration items, making it easier to locate where the configuration is being used across applications, environments, clusters, and namespaces. See [Configuration queries (administrator privileges)](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_17-configuration-queries-administrator-privileges).\r\n\r\n### Observer Mode for Application AccessKey \r\nBefore officially enabling application keys, you can configure Application AccessKeys in observation mode to only log without intercepting configuration retrieval.\r\n\r\n### Limitation on the Number of Namespaces and Configuration Items\r\nUsers can now limit the number of namespaces and also the number of configuration items in a single namespace. See [Parameter settings for limiting the number of namespaces in the appld+cluster dimension](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_64-parameter-settings-for-limiting-the-number-of-namespaces-in-the-appldcluster-dimension) and [Limitation on the number of configuration items in a single namespace](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_65-limitation-on-the-number-of-configuration-items-in-a-single-namespace).\r\n\r\n### Cluster-Level Permission Control Support\r\nUsers can now configure editing and publishing permissions for namespaces based on cluster granularity. [Configuring permissions for different dimensions](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_123-configuring-permissions-for-different-dimensions).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n*
