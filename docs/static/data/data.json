[#6558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6558)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n### Agent Forwarding\r\n\r\nTeleport 6.2 brings a potentially backward incompatible change with `tsh` agent forwarding.\r\n\r\nPrior to Teleport 6.2, `tsh ssh -A` would create an in-memory SSH agent from your `~/.tsh` directory and forward that agent to the target host.\r\n\r\nStarting in Teleport 6.2 `tsh ssh -A` by default now forwards your system SSH agent (available at `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Users wishing to retain the prior behavior can use `tsh ssh -o \"ForwardAgent local\"`.\r\n\r\nFor more details see [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md) and implementation in [#6525](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6525).\r\n\r\n### DynamoDB Indexing Change\r\n\r\nDynamoDB users should note that the events backend indexing strategy has changed and a data migration will be triggered after upgrade. For optimal performance perform this migration with only one auth server online. It may take some time and progress will be periodically written to the auth server log. During this migration, only events that have been migrated will appear in the Web UI. After completion, all events will be available.\r\n\r\nNote that this migration may cause rate-limiting errors from AWS APIs and is slow on large deployments (1000+ existing audit events). Teleport 6.2.1 will include improved migration performance. If you run a large DynamoDB-based cluster, we advise you to wait for Teleport 6.2.1 before upgrading.\r\n\r\nFor more details see [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) and implementation in [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583).\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nDownload the current and previous releases of Teleport at https://gravitational.com/teleport/download.", "created_at": "2021-05-25T00:24:08Z", "project": "Teleport", "repo": "gravitational/teleport", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v17.2.11", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/chef/chef/commits/0af49095bce6cc137681f553df2f2b20584ddd79", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chef/chef", "body": "Bump version to 17.2.11 by Chef Expeditor\n\nObvious fix; these changes are the result of automation not creative thinking.", "created_at": "2021-05-24T22:52:36Z", "project": "Chef", "repo": "chef/chef", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "Release v2.2.6", "tag_name": "v2.2.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases/tag/v2.2.6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server", "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n- 1.16.4: Both release executables and Docker images are built with this Go release.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- `pinned_certs` is now also checked by servers initiating connections, not only when accepting them.

This allows Boundary, by default, to have the admin UI and desktop\n  client work without further specification of origins by the operator. This is\n  only affecting default behavior; if `cors_enabled` is explicitly set to\n  `true`, the behavior will be the same as before. This had been changed in\n  v0.2.1 due to a bug found in v0.2.0 that caused all origins to always be\n  allowed, but fixing that bug exposed that the default behavior was difficult\n  for users to configure to simply get up and running.\n* If a `cancel` operation is run on a session already in a canceling or\n  terminated state, a `200` and the session information will be returned instead\n  of an error.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* sessions: Return a `200` and session information when canceling an\n  already-canceled or terminated session\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1243))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cors: Change the default allowed origins when `cors_enabled` is not specified\n  to be `*`.

This can help dealing with high cardinality and high churn rate issues. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#cardinality-limiter).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add ability to limit the number of unique time series, which can be sent to remote storage systems per hour and per day. This can help dealing with high cardinality and high churn rate issues. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to run alerting and recording rules for multiple tenants. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/740) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#multitenancy).\r\n* FEATURE: vminsert: add support for data ingestion via other `vminsert` nodes. This allows building multi-level data ingestion paths in VictoriaMetrics cluster by writing data from one level of `vminsert` nodes to another level of `vminsert` nodes. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multi-level-cluster-setup) and [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/541#issuecomment-835487858) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: reload `bearer_token_file`, `credentials_file` and `password_file` contents every second. This allows dynamically changing the contents of these files during target scraping and service discovery without the need to restart `vmagent`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1297).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add a flag to control behaviour on startup for state restore errors. Such errors were returned and logged before as well. Now user can specify whether to just log these errors (`-remoteRead.ignoreRestoreErrors=true`) or to stop the process (`-remoteRead.ignoreRestoreErrors=false`). The latter is important when VM isn't ready yet to serve queries from vmalert and it needs to wait. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1252).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to pass `round_digits` query arg to datasource via `-datasource.roundDigits` command-line flag. This can be used for limiting the number of decimal digits after the point in recording rule results. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/525).\r\n* FEATURE: return `X-Server-Hostname` header in http responses of all the VictoriaMetrics components. This should simplify tracing the origin server behind a load balancer or behind auth proxy during troubleshooting.\r\n* FEATURE: vmselect: allow to use 2x more memory for query processing at `vmselect` nodes in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html). This should allow processing heavy queries without the need to increase RAM size at `vmselect` nodes.\r\n* FEATURE: add ability to filter `/api/v1/status/tsdb` output with arbitrary [time series selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) passed via `match[]` query args. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#tsdb-stats) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1168) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: automatically detect memory and cpu limits for VictoriaMetrics components running under [cgroup v2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) environments such as [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1269).\r\n* FEATURE: vmauth: allow `-auth.config` reloading via `/-/reload` http endpoint. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1194).\r\n* FEATURE: add `timezone_offset(tz)` function. It returns offset in seconds for the given timezone `tz` relative to UTC. This can be useful when combining with datetime-related functions. For example, `day_of_week(time()+timezone_offset(\"America/Los_Angeles\"))` would return weekdays for `America/Los_Angeles` time zone. Special `Local` time zone can be used for returning an offset for the time zone set on the host where VictoriaMetrics runs. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1306) and [MetricsQL docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) for more details.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add support for OAuth2 authorization for scrape targets and service discovery in the same way as Prometheus does. See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#oauth2).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add support for OAuth2 authorization when writing data to `-remoteWrite.url`. See `-remoteWrite.oauth2.*` config params in `/path/to/vmagent -help` output.\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to set `extra_filter_labels` at alerting and recording group configs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#groups).\r\n* FEATURE: vmstorage: reduce memory usage by up to 30% when ingesting big number of active time series.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: do not retry scraping targets, which don't support HTTP. This should reduce CPU load and network usage at `vmagent` and at scrape target. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1289).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: fix possible race when refreshing `role: endpoints` and `role: endpointslices` scrape targets in `kubernetes_sd_config`. Prevoiusly `pod` objects could be updated after the related `endpoints` object update. This could lead to missing scrape targets. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1240).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: properly spread scrape targets among `vmagent` replicas if `-promscrape.cluster.replicationFactor` exceeds 1. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1292).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: limit `scrape_timeout` by `scrape_interval`. This guarantees that only a single sample is lost during the configured `scrape_interval` when scrape target responds slowly. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1281#issuecomment-840538907) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: properly remove stale parts outside the configured retention if `-retentionPeriod` is smaller than one month. Previously stale parts could remain active for up to a month after they go outside the retention.\r\n* BUGFIX: stop the process on panic errors, since such errors may leave the process in inconsistent state. Previously panics could be recovered, which could result in unexpected hard-to-debug further behavior of running process.\r\n* BUGFIX: vminsert, vmagent: make sure data ingestion connections are closed before completing graceful shutdown. Previously the connection may remain open, which could result in trailing samples loss.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmauth, vmalert: properly re-use HTTP keep-alive connections to backends and datasources. Previously only 2 keep-alive connections per backend could be re-used. Other connections were closed after the first request. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1300) for details.\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: fix false positive error `result contains metrics with the same labelset after applying rule labels`, which could be triggered when recording rules generate unique metrics. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1293).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmctl: properly import InfluxDB rows if they have a field and a tag with identical names. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1299).\r\n* BUGFIX: properly reload configs if `SIGHUP` signal arrives during service initialization.

(k3s-io/k3s#3235)\r\n* The install script properly passes through shell metacharacters present in K3s command-line flags. (k3s-io/k3s#3355)\r\n* The install script now ensures correct filesystem permissions for the environment file when run as a non-root user. (k3s-io/k3s#3355 @claycooper)\r\n* The uninstall script now attempts to unmount CSI volumes before cleaning up the local filesystem. (k3s-io/k3s#3265 @angelnu)\r\n* CLI flags loaded from configuration files are now included in the node-args annotation. (k3s-io/k3s#3290)\r\n* When merging multiple configuration files from `config.yaml.d`, lists can be appended to instead of replaced by ending the flag name with `+`. (k3s-io/k3s#3229)\r\n* Etcd snapshots can now be listed, pruned, and deleted via the `k3s etcd-snapshot` subcommand (k3s-io/k3s#3277 k3s-io/k3s#3303 k3s-io/k3s#3310)\r\n* K3s now supports specifying an alternative registry to host images for packaged components, via the `--system-default-registry` CLI flag. (k3s-io/k3s#3285)  \r\n    This setting is configured on servers, propagated to agents. Any images found in airgap tarballs will be retagged to appear to come from this registry as well as the default registry (docker.io).\r\n* The in-cluster Kubernetes apiserver certificate is now valid for the same hostnames/addresses as the external certificate. (k3s-io/k3s#3241)\r\n* The Kubernetes default certificate signing controllers now use the correct CAs to sign server certificates. (k3s-io/k3s#3259 @siegfriedweber)\r\n* Conntrack-related sysctls critical to the operation of kube-proxy are now set directly by K3s, instead of by the embedded kube-proxy. (k3s-io/k3s#3341)\r\n* Privileged containers can now be run inside Dockerized K3s clusters (`k3d`, `docker run rancher/k3s`, etc) without receiving a \"apply caps: operation not permitted: unknown\" error. (k3s-io/k3s#3359)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known Issues: \r\n* There is a [regression](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2669) that may cause issues with deleting nodes due to finalizers not being removed. If you observe a node is stuck for some time and is not being deleted you can describe the node to see if any finalizers remain. If there are any finalizers, you can work around this issue by running the following command to remove the finalizers:\r\n```bash\r\n# replace $NODENAME with the name of the node\r\nkubectl patch node $NODENAME -p '{\"metadata\":{\"finalizers\":[]}}' --type=merge\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.21.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md#v1211) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.6.0](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.6.0) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.33.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_33_0.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.4.13-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.4.13-k3s1) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.4.4-k3s2](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.4-k3s2) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.0.0-rc95](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.13.1-rc2 (273b36c)](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/compare/v0.13.1-rc2...273b36c) | \r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.3.6](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.6) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.4.8](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.8) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.8.3](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.8.3) | \r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.9.1](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.9.1) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.19](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.19) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

This should not impact Azure Monitor Logs queries, but if the variables are being used in other data sources which expect a Workspace GUID may no longer be compatible.\n\nCustom template variables used in the workspace or resource field in Azure Monitor Logs queries should resolve to an Azure Resource URI in the format `/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`\n Issue [#34445](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/34445)\n\nRemoves support for deprecated backend plugin protocol (v1) including usage of github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-model.\n\n Issue [#34127](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/34127)\n\n### Plugin development fixes & changes\n\n* **QueryField:** Remove carriage return character from pasted text.

We've often heard that people find it confusing when a plan includes a change that doesn't seem to be prompted by any recent change in the _configuration_, and so this feature is aiming to provide the previously-missing explanation for situations where Terraform is planning to undo a change.\n    \n    It can also be useful just as general information when the change _won't_ be undone by Terraform: if you've intentionally made a change outside of Terraform and mirrored that change in your configuration then Terraform will now confirm that it noticed the change you made and took it into account when planning.\n    \n    By default this new output is for information only and doesn't change any behavior. If Terraform detects a change you were _expecting_ then you don't need to take any additional action to respond to it. However, we've also added a new planning mode `-refresh-only` which allows you to explicitly plan and apply the action of writing those detected changes to the Terraform state, which serves as a plannable replacement for `terraform refresh`. We don't have any plans to remove the long-standing `terraform refresh` command, but we do recommend using `terraform apply -refresh-only` instead in most cases, because it will provide an opportunity to review what Terraform detected before updating the Terraform state.\n\nUPGRADE NOTES:\n\n* This release adds some new reserved reference prefixes to make them available for later work. These are `resource.`, `template.`, `arg.`, and `lazy.`. We don't expect these additions to cause problems for most existing configurations, but could cause a conflict if you are using a custom provider which has a resource type named exactly \"resource\", \"template\", \"arg\", or \"lazy\". In that unlikely event, you can escape references to resources of those types by adding a `resource.` prefix; for example, if you have a `resource \"template\" \"foo\"` then you can change references to it from `template.foo` to `resource.template.foo` in order to escape the new meaning.\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* config: The various functions that compute hashs of files on disk, like `filesha256`, will now stream the contents of the given file into the hash function in smaller chunks. Previously they would always read the entire file into memory before hashing it, due to following a similar implementation strategy as the `file` function. ([#28681](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28681))\n* config: Some new escaping syntax which is not yet useful but will be part of the backward-compatibility story for certain future language editions. ([#28709](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28709))\n* core: Rsource diagnostics are no longer lost on remote state storage fails ([#28724](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28724))\n* core: Diagnostics from provisioner failures are now shown in CLI output ([#28753](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28753))\n* `terraform init`: add a new `-migrate-state` flag instead of automatic state migration, to prevent failing when old backend config is not usable ([#28718](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28718))\n* `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: will now report any changes Terraform detects during the \"refresh\" phase for each managed object, providing confirmation that Terraform has seen those changes and, where appropriate, extra context to help understand the planned change actions that follow. ([#28634](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28634))\n* `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: now have a new option `-refresh-only` to activate the \"refresh only\" planning mode, which causes Terraform to ignore any changes suggested by the configuration but still detect any changes made outside of Terraform since the latest `terraform apply`. ([#28634](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28634))\n* backend/gcs: Terraform Core now supports [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation). The federated JSON credentials must be loaded through the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. This is also available in the Google Provider in versions newer than v3.61. ([#28296](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28296))\n* backend/remote: supports several new CLI options when running plans and applies with Terraform Cloud: `-refresh=false`, `-replace`, and `-refresh-only`. ([#28746](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28746))\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* core: Fix sensitivity handling with plan values, which could cause the sensitive marks to be lost during apply leading to a perpetual diff ([#28687](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28687))\n* core: Fix crash when specifying SSH `bastion_port` in a resource `connection` block ([#28665](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28665))\n* core: Terraform will now upgrade and refresh (unless disabled) deposed objects during planning, in a similar manner as for objects that have been removed from the configuration. \"Deposed\" is how Terraform represents the situation where a `create_before_destroy` replacement failed to destroy the old object, in which case Terraform needs to track both the new and old objects until the old object is successfully deleted. Refreshing these during planning means that you can, if you wish, delete a \"deposed\" object manually outside of Terraform and then have Terraform detect that you've done so. ([#28634](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28634))\n* config: Improve the sensitivity support for `lookup` and `length` functions, which were accidentally omitted from the larger update in 0.15.1 ([#28509](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28509))\n* backend/gcs: Fixed a bug where service account impersonation didn't work if the original identity was another service account ([#28139](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28139))\n\n", "created_at": "2021-05-19T18:53:13Z", "project": "Terraform", "repo": "hashicorp/terraform", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "containerd 1.5.2", "tag_name": "v1.5.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "body": "Welcome to the v1.5.2 release of containerd!\n\nThe second patch release for containerd 1.5 is a security release to update\nrunc for [CVE-2021-30465](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r)\n\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\n\n### Contributors\n\n* Derek McGowan\n* Akihiro Suda\n* Phil Estes\n\n### Changes\n<details><summary>4 commits</summary>\n<p>\n\n* [`36cc87449`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/36cc874494a56a253cd181a1a685b44b58a2e34a) Merge pull request  [#5515](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5515) from dmcgowan/prepare-1.5.2\n* [`354f729a4`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/354f729a4c1a188b372775836b53c7f9ef324752) Prepare release notes for v1.5.2\n* [`55c147d5b`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/55c147d5ba8440f4aed19407bcb882409b872d4c) Merge pull request  [#5512](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5512) from AkihiroSuda/runc-rc95-15\n* [`ccfb9c509`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/ccfb9c509fef3fcc10441de4d9740c8327a175eb) update runc binary to v1.0.0-rc95\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Dependency Changes\n\nThis release has no dependency changes\n\nPrevious release can be found at [v1.5.1](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.1)\n", "created_at": "2021-05-19T16:52:31Z", "project": "Containerd", "repo": "containerd/containerd", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "21.5.1", "tag_name": "21.5.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/21.5.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry", "body": "- No documented changes.", "created_at": "2021-05-19T10:56:56Z", "project": "Sentry", "repo": "getsentry/sentry", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.10.14", "tag_name": "v1.10.14", "html_url": "https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/releases/tag/v1.10.14", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Netflix/eureka", "body": "- Update Jackson to 2.10 branch (#1393)\r\n- Rotate publishing credentials\r\n- Update ResolverUtils::randomize (#1383)\r\n- Upgrade xstream to 1.4.16 for CVE-2021-213{41-51} (#1386)\r\n- Replace jcenter with maven central (#1381)", "created_at": "2021-05-18T21:24:40Z", "project": "Eureka", "repo": "Netflix/eureka", "type": "Discovery", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.11.0", "tag_name": "v0.11.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.11.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind", "body": "`v0.11.0` brings in much sought after support for multi-arch, rootless, dual stack along with a couple of performance fixes.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.21.1` image: `kindest/node:v1.21.1@sha256:fae9a58f17f18f06aeac9772ca8b5ac680ebbed985e266f711d936e91d113bad`\r\n- Dropped support for building node images with bazel going forward as part of [reducing the build maintenance](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2420) for Kubernetes.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage. There has been some significant progress made on the alpha features as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Enhanced [ZFS Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) to use a custom node label called `openebs.io/nodeid` to set the node affinity for the provisioned volume. By default, the value will be the same as `kubernetes.io/hostname`.  Using a custom label like this will help in quickly migrating the volumes to a new node in cases where a node fails and the user needs to move the underlying disks to a new node in the cluster. After moving the disks, the user can set the `openebs.io/nodeid` with the value used in the previous node. (https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/issues/304). You can read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/blob/master/docs/faq.md#8-how-to-migrate-pvs-to-the-new-node-in-case-old-node-is-not-accessible).\r\n- Enhanced [cStor Velero plugin](https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/pull/154) to allow users to specify a custom timeout for completing snapshot operations. The timeout can be configured via the `restApiTimeout ` field in VolumeSnapshotLocation. See [example](https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/blob/master/example/06-volumesnapshotlocation.yaml). (https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/issues/148)\r\n- Added helm chart for [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/tree/master/deploy/helm/charts). \r\n- Enhanced [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/blob/master/docs/storageclasses.md) to allow users to specify a pattern string of volume groups from which LVM Local PV should be provisioned. This feature will help in cases where a node can have multiple volume groups or volume group names across the cluster have to be unique. (https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/28)\r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- [cStor] Fixed an issue where helm chart pre-delete webhook was using a deprecated `hyperkube` image. Moved to `kubectl` images from [bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kubectl). (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3383)\r\n- [cStor] Fixed an issue where some of the cStor operators were using deprecated `ubuntu 16.04` as the base image. Moved to `ubuntu 18.04`.(https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3386)\r\n- Several fixes to docs were also included in this release. \r\n- OpenEBS participated in the CNCF BugBash program in KubeCon EU 2021 and has received more than [90 PRs, out of which 50+](https://github.com/search?o=asc&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Aevent%2Fkubecon-eu21-bugbash+org%3Aopenebs&s=created&state=closed&type=Issues) were accepted. \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v2.9.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugmayastor.html) 0.8.0 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 2.9.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 2.9.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.7.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.4.4 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.2.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Jiva](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/jiva.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-hostpath.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-device.html) 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n  - [cStor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/cstor.html) 2.9.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.3.0 (alpha)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.4.1 (beta)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alpha Feature Updates\r\n- [Dynamic NFS Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner)\r\n   - Multi-arch container images with support for amd64, arm64, arm, and ppc64le\r\n   - Helm chart \r\n- [CSI Driver for Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv)\r\n   - Support Creation and Deletion of a Local PV - by creating a partition of the requested capacity on local block devices. \r\n- [openebsctl](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl)\r\n   - Refactor the CLI to support `APP VERB NOUN` format.

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* We have several exciting features become stable: Shuffle-sharding, querying chunks and blocks store simultaneously, lazy mmap-ing of block indexes, etc.\r\n* Several query and ingest performance improvements!\r\n* Tons of bugfixes and optimisations!\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager now removes local files after Alertmanager is no longer running for removed or resharded user. #3910\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager now stores local files in per-tenant folders. Files stored by Alertmanager previously are migrated to new hierarchy. Support for this migration will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3910\r\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: deprecated `-ruler.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) in favour of `-ruler-storage.*`. The deprecated config will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3945\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: deprecated `-alertmanager.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) in favour of `-alertmanager-storage.*`. This change doesn't apply to `-alertmanager.storage.path` and `-alertmanager.storage.retention`. The deprecated config will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #4002\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-cluster.` CLI flags deprecated in Cortex 1.7. The new config options to use are: #3946\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.listen-address` instead of `-cluster.listen-address`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.advertise-address` instead of `-cluster.advertise-address`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.peers` instead of `-cluster.peer`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout` instead of `-cluster.peer-timeout`\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: removed the config option `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-cache.postings-compression-enabled`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6. Postings compression is always enabled. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier: removed the config option `-store.max-look-back-period`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6 and was used only by the chunks storage. You should use `-querier.max-query-lookback` instead. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Query Frontend: removed the config option `-querier.compress-http-responses`, which was deprecated in Cortex 1.6. You should use`-api.response-compression-enabled` instead. #4101\r\n* [CHANGE] Runtime-config / overrides: removed the config options `-limits.per-user-override-config` (use `-runtime-config.file`) and `-limits.per-user-override-period` (use `-runtime-config.reload-period`), both deprecated since Cortex 0.6.0. #4112\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex now fails fast on startup if unable to connect to the ring backend. #4068\r\n* [FEATURE] The following features have been marked as stable: #4101\r\n  - Shuffle-sharding\r\n  - Querier support for querying chunks and blocks store at the same time\r\n  - Tracking of active series and exporting them as metrics (`-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` and related flags)\r\n  - Blocks storage: lazy mmap of block indexes in the store-gateway (`-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-lazy-loading-enabled`)\r\n  - Ingester: close idle TSDB and remove them from local disk (`-blocks-storage.tsdb.close-idle-tsdb-timeout`)\r\n* [FEATURE] Memberlist: add TLS configuration options for the memberlist transport layer used by the gossip KV store. #4046\r\n  * New flags added for memberlist communication:\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-enabled`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-cert-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-key-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-ca-path`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-server-name`\r\n    * `-memberlist.tls-insecure-skip-verify`\r\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: added `local` backend support to the ruler storage configuration under the `-ruler-storage.` flag prefix. #3932\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgraded Docker base images to `alpine:3.13`. #4042\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: reduce ingester memory by eliminating series reference cache. #3951\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: optimized `<prefix>/api/v1/rules` and `<prefix>/api/v1/alerts` when ruler sharding is enabled. #3916\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added the following metrics when ruler sharding is enabled: #3916\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_clients`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_client_request_duration_seconds`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add API endpoint to list all tenant alertmanager configs: `GET /multitenant_alertmanager/configs`. #3529\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add API endpoint to list all tenant ruler rule groups: `GET /ruler/rule_groups`. #3529\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend/scheduler: added querier forget delay (`-query-frontend.querier-forget-delay` and `-query-scheduler.querier-forget-delay`) to mitigate the blast radius in the event queriers crash because of a repeatedly sent \"query of death\" when shuffle-sharding is enabled. #3901\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: reduced memory allocations when serializing query response. #3964\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / ruler: some optimizations to PromQL query engine. #3934 #3989\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory when an high number of errors are returned by the ingester on the write path with the blocks storage. #3969 #3971 #3973\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: reduce CPU and memory when an high number of errors are returned by the distributor on the write path. #3990\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Put metric before label value in the \"label value too long\" error message. #4018\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow use of `y|w|d` suffixes for duration related limits and per-tenant limits. #4044\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Small optimization on top of PR #3968 to avoid unnecessary Extents merging. #4026\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a metric `cortex_compactor_compaction_interval_seconds` for the compaction interval config value. #4040\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added following per-ingester (instance) experimental limits: max number of series in memory (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-series`), max number of users in memory (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-tenants`), max ingestion rate (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-ingestion-rate`), and max inflight requests (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`). These limits are only used when using blocks storage. Limits can also be configured using runtime-config feature, and current values are exported as `cortex_ingester_instance_limits` metric. #3992.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Cortex is now built with Go 1.16. #4062\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added per-distributor experimental limits: max number of inflight requests (`-distributor.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`) and max ingestion rate in samples/sec (`-distributor.instance-limits.max-ingestion-rate`). If not set, these two are unlimited. Also added metrics to expose current values (`cortex_distributor_inflight_push_requests`, `cortex_distributor_ingestion_rate_samples_per_second`) as well as limits (`cortex_distributor_instance_limits` with various `limit` label values). #4071\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Added `-ruler.enabled-tenants` and `-ruler.disabled-tenants` to explicitly enable or disable rules processing for specific tenants. #4074\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Block Storage Ingester: `/flush` now accepts two new parameters: `tenant` to specify tenant to flush and `wait=true` to make call synchronous. Multiple tenants can be specified by repeating `tenant` parameter. If no `tenant` is specified, all tenants are flushed, as before. #4073\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: validate configured `-alertmanager.web.external-url` and fail if ends with `/`. #4081\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: added `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` and `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` to block specific network addresses in HTTP-based Alertmanager receiver integrations. #4085\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow configuration of Cassandra's host selection policy. #4069\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: retry synching blocks if a per-tenant sync fails. #3975 #4088\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add metric `cortex_tcp_connections` exposing the current number of accepted TCP connections. #4099\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Allow federated queries to run concurrently. #4065\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Label Values API call now supports `match[]` parameter when querying blocks on storage (assuming `-querier.query-store-for-labels-enabled` is enabled). #4133\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler-API: fix bug where `/api/v1/rules/<namespace>/<group_name>` endpoint return `400` instead of `404`. #4013\r\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: reverted changes done to rate limiting in #3825. #3948\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix race condition when opening and closing tsdb concurrently. #3959\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: streamline tracing spans. #3924\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler Storage: ignore objects with empty namespace or group in the name. #3999\r\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: fix issue causing distributors to not extend the replication set because of failing instances when zone-aware replication is enabled. #3977\r\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Fix issue where cached entry size keeps increasing when making tiny query repeatedly. #3968\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: `-compactor.blocks-retention-period` now supports weeks (`w`) and years (`y`). #4027\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: returning 422 (instead of 500) when query hits `max_chunks_per_query` limit with block storage, when the limit is hit in the store-gateway. #3937\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Rule group limit enforcement should now allow the same number of rules in a group as the limit. #3616\r\n* [BUGFIX] Frontend, Query-scheduler: allow querier to notify about shutdown without providing any authentication. #4066\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed race condition causing queries to fail right after querier startup with the \"empty ring\" error. #4068\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: Increment `cortex_compactor_runs_failed_total` if compactor failed compact a single tenant. #4094\r\n* [BUGFIX] Tracing: hot fix to avoid the Jaeger tracing client to indefinitely block the Cortex process shutdown in case the HTTP connection to the tracing backend is blocked. #4134\r\n* [BUGFIX] Forward proper EndsAt from ruler to Alertmanager inline with Prometheus behaviour. #4017\r\n\r\n## Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Builder: add `-builder.timestamp-tolerance` option which may reduce block size by rounding timestamps to make difference whole seconds. #3891\r\n", "created_at": "2021-05-14T14:27:54Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.5-dev0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/1f97306ecc0cf1e0b7c324406f45b256286e9766", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.5-dev0\n\nReleased version 2.5-dev0 with the following main changes :\n    - MINOR: version: it's development again", "created_at": "2021-05-14T07:36:37Z", "project": "HaProxy", "repo": "haProxy/haProxy", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.3.2", "tag_name": "v0.3.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.3.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint", "body": "## 0.3.2 (May 13, 2021)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n\n* plugin/k8s: `scratch_path` now uses an array of strings instead of a string, allowing you to specify multiple directories to be mounted as [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) [[GH-1317](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1317)]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* platform/aws: Set the AWS log level along with the waypoint log level [[GH-1404](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1404)]\n* plugin/aws/ecs: Add ability to request an internal ALB for ECS [[GH-1403](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1403)]\n* plugin/docker: Add support for exposing additional ports [[GH-1414](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1414)]\n* plugin/docker: Add support for build args for both docker and img builders [[GH-1346](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1346)]\n* plugin/ecs: Allow memory\\_reservation to be set on primary container [[GH-1415](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/1415)]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* cli: Add `context inspect` command to aid in user enjoyment of waypoint contexts.

We highly suggest to upgrade to this new version.\r\n\r\nImprovements in 1.1.6:\r\n\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 You can now specify any and all tags in a `TrafficPermission` policy.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 You can now specify TCP and HTTP health checks at the same time in the same policy. The health check policy also now includes a `reuse_connection` option.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 The `--gateway` flag is now available in the CLI.\r\n- \ud83d\ude80 We have added support for ingress controller installation from `kumactl`. The first ingress controller supported is Kong Gateway.\r\n- You can now install the Kuma demo application with the CLI.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

To get started check the [docs](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/azure/)\r\n\r\n* Default settings for AWS instances are updated to take advantage of recent performance and security features:\r\n    * Default etcd volumes encryption changes to enabled for newly created clusters\r\n    * Default root volume encryption changes to enabled\r\n    * Default etcd volumes type changes from `gp2` to `gp3`\r\n    * Default root volume type changes from `gp2` to `gp3`\r\n\r\n* Added [template funtions](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/cluster_template/#template-functions) for kubernetes version based on channel data.\r\n\r\n* kOps now use helm3 functions for merging template `--set` and `--values` arguments. This has slightly different behaviour than previous helm2-like logic.\r\n\r\n* Following kubeadm, control plane nodes are now labelled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=\"\"`\r\n\r\n* Default node image for GCE changed from COS to Ubuntu for K8s versions >= 1.18.0. This is to more closely align with the AWS implementation (the most mature support) and because COS limits the ability to modify files on its disk.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes 1.11 and 1.12 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been removed.  All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* If you are using the Calico network plugin in a cross-subnet setup, you may have to manually remove the AWS Source/Dest Check controller (`k8s-ec2-srcdst`) deployment that was previously deprecated and replaced with the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) feature.\r\n\r\n* If you are using self-hosted channels files, you have to add the new `architectureID` field, with one of the `amd64` or `arm64` values.\r\n\r\n* If you are running `kops toolbox template` in an airgapped environment, you have to set `--channel` to point to a local channel file.\r\n\r\n* If your workload targets control plane nodes, you need to change them to select the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=\"\"` label. You should also add the `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` toleration to these workloads. This taint will not be added to control plane nodes before kOps 1.22.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.13 and 1.14 are deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.21.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and will be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.22\r\n\r\n* The experimental node-authorizer that could be enabled using `nodeAuthorization` has been removed.

[#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213)\r\n- The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5.\r\n- If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/)\r\n- The [local cluster can no longer be turned off](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster), which means all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin)\r\n- For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002)\r\n- For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster.\r\n[#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216)\r\n- For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226)\r\n- There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789)\r\n\r\n### Docker Install\r\n\r\n- When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the docs for more info.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n- When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s docs](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229)\r\n- There are UI issues around startup time. [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800) [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes 1.19 + firewalld\r\n\r\n- For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840)\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Monitoring Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Monitoring graphs have been added to the Cluster Explorer in the Rancher UI. [#30126](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30126)\r\n- A new RBAC role has been added to give users read-only access to monitoring components such as the Grafana dashboard. [#31411](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31411) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/monitoring-alerting/rbac/#additional-monitoring-clusterroles)\r\n- Persistent Grafana dashboards can now be created by adding a ConfigMap to any namespace, and a narrower permission named **Manage Config Maps** is required to create them. [#31921](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31921) [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/monitoring-alerting/persist-grafana/)\r\n- As of v2.5.8, users no longer need to manually annotate the `cattle-dashboards` namespace with `helm.sh/resource-policy: \"keep\"` to prevent it, and its associated resources, from being deleted when uninstalling the Monitoring chart. For users who are using Monitoring V2 v9.4.203 or below, the namespace still needs to be manually marked with the annotation `helm.sh/resource-policy: \"keep\"`. [#31769](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31769)\r\n- You can now more easily set up SMS and Teams notifiers using our new `rancher-alerting-drivers` Helm chart that helps you install alerting drivers that are not natively supported by Prometheus. [#29951](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29951)\r\n\r\n##### Windows Support for Monitoring V2\r\n\r\n- For metrics to be scraped from Windows nodes, each Windows node in the cluster must use wins v.0.1.0. For details on upgrading wins on Windows nodes, refer to [this page.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/monitoring-alerting/windows-clusters/#upgrading-existing-clusters-to-wins-v0-1-0) [#31842](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31842)\r\n- Metrics will be scraped from Windows nodes using [windows\\_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) (a community project previously named `wmi_exporter` when deployed in Monitoring V1). [#31148](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31148) [#31497](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31497)\r\n- The Monitoring V2 application adds Linux nodeSelectors and tolerations throughout all monitoring components to ensure they are never deployed on a Windows host. [#31498](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31498)\r\n- We now allow a container to publish a port available on the host network as a container port. This allows privileged containers using wins to avoid exposing a port on the host itself when it only needs to be exposed on the container level. [#13](https://github.com/rancher/wins/issues/13)\r\n- As of v2.5.8, when Rancher provisions a new Windows cluster, the cluster is able to support wins upgrades and it is able to use the new Monitoring V2 chart with no changes. [#31499](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31499)\r\n\r\n### Enhanced GKE Lifecycle Management\r\n\r\nFull lifecycle management has been brought to GKE clusters that are newly provisioned or registered:\r\n\r\n-   [Shared VPCs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) are now supported.\r\n-   We now support more options for configuring private GKE clusters. Note: This advanced setup can require more steps during the cluster provisioning process. For details, see [this section.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/gke/#private-clusters)\r\n-   We now support more configuration options for Rancher managed GKE clusters. For the full list of options, see the [docs.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/gke/config-reference/)\r\n-   When provisioning a GKE cluster, you can now use reusable cloud credentials instead of using a service account token directly to create the cluster.\r\n-   Greater management capabilities are now available for registered GKE clusters. The same configuration options are available for registered GKE clusters as for the GKE clusters created through the Rancher UI. [Docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/cluster-provisioning/registered-clusters/#additional-features-for-registered-eks-and-gke-clusters)\r\n\r\n### Logging Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Upgraded the Banzai logging operator. [#31644](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31644)\r\n- Logging now works on SELinux enabled setups and has been tested on RHEL/CentOS 7 and 8. Note that If journald is configured in persistent mode on RKE2 cluster nodes you will need to set `systemdLogPath` to `/var/log/journal`. This is the default behavior in Ubuntu. [#30949](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30949) [#31309](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31309) [Rancher RPM installation docs.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/security/selinux/)\r\n\r\n##### Windows Support for Logging V2\r\n\r\n- Added support for Windows clusters. Logs can now be collected from Windows Nodes. [#28721](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28721)\r\n\r\n### Istio Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Clusters with PSPs enabled are now supported. PSP templates have been added and can be enabled for Istio, Kiali, and Tracing. [#30744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30744)\r\n- Added v1.9.3 and v1.8.5 for Istio, which both address a vulnerability. For more info see the [security announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2021-002/). Only v1.9.3 supports an air gapped installation.\r\n\r\n### Backup Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher Continuous Delivery (Fleet) and rancher-operator are now handled during backup. [Backup#69](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/issues/69)\r\n\r\n### CIS Scan Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Support for CIS scans using the CIS 1.6 benchmark has been added for RKE2 and K3s clusters. [#29649](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29649)\r\n\r\n### Fleet Enhancements\r\n\r\n- All labels on Rancher clusters are available using `global.fleet.clusterLabels.LABELNAME`. These can now be accessed directly as variables. [#152](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/152) [Docs](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/blob/master/docs/gitrepo-structure.md)\r\n- Downstream Fleet agents now fall back to Linux nodes if Windows nodes are not yet available in Windows clusters. [#324](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/324)\r\n- Fleet now supports authentication with private Helm repositories. Note that SSH keys with passphrase are not supported. [#120](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/120) [Docs](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/blob/master/docs/gitrepo-structure.md)\r\n- Fleet now supports using webhook to receive changes from git. [#252](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/252)\r\n- Rancher agent and Fleet agent work behind a proxy. RFE tickets: [#29993](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29993) and [#25412](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25412)\r\n\r\n### RKE Cluster Enhancements\r\n\r\nUsers can enable project network isolation on any RKE cluster if the CNI network plugin supports the enforcement of Kubernetes network policies. Previously, the Canal network plugin was required for project network isolation. [#31338](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31338)\r\n\r\n### Release Image Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Releases now include an annotated copy images.txt displaying the source of each image. [#31663](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31663)\r\n- Windows image digests are now included with releases. [#25222](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25222)\r\n\r\n# Security Fixes\r\n\r\n- A security issue was discovered in the current image of RANCHER/NGINX-INGRESS-CONTROLLER version 0.43.0-rancher1. This issue was assigned CVE-2021-3449 and CVE-2021-3540. To fix the issue, the openssl version of the image \"nginx-0.43.0-rancher1\" was updated from 1.1.1i to 1.1.1k. [#538](https://github.com/rancher/kontainer-driver-metadata/pull/538) [#2522](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2522)\r\n- Multiple critical and high CVEs were discovered in the `rancher/library-nginx:1.19.2-alpine` image. The image has since been updated to `rancher/library-nginx:1.19.9-alpine` and addresses the CVEs listed. [#82](https://github.com/rancher/image-mirror/pull/82) [#440](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts/pull/440)\r\n  - Curl: CVE-2020-8231, CVE-2020-8285, CVE-2020-8169, CVE-2020-8286, and CVE-2020-8177\r\n  - libxml2: CVE-2020-24977\r\n  - freetype: CVE-2020-15999\r\n  - musl: CVE-2020-28928 \r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed several [UI issues.](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av2.5.8+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ateam%2Fui)\r\n- Switched to deterministic naming strategy for ClusterRoleBinding and RoleBinding resources to mitigate duplicate issues. [#29932](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29932)\r\n- Uninstalling Rancher no longer leaves pods running in the cluster for apps like Fleet, Rancher-Operator or Rancher-Webhook. [#30924](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30924)\r\n- Logging in the Cluster Explorer when using RKE no longer creates large files in `/var/lib/rancher/logging/rke`. After upgrading, this file can be safely deleted. [#31309](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31309)\r\n- EKS contained a bug where certain regions failed during deployment when using default user data. [#31612](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31612)\r\n- When provisioning EC2 clusters, AMIs are now up to date. [#31708](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31708)\r\n- When provisioning RKE clusters with a private registry, the private registry is applied properly to all system images. [#31726](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31726)\r\n- Windows images for air gap are now available for charts maintained in [rancher/charts](https://github.com/rancher/charts). [#32290](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32290)\r\n- Deleting a nodepool with multiple nodes no longer incorrectly deletes only one node in the provider. [#31765](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31765)\r\n- After upgrading Rancher, new nodes are no longer stuck at the \"waiting to register\" stage. [#31999](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31999)\r\n- The private registry setting in RKE is now respected by kubectl/shell and Helm operation pods. [#30735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30735)\r\n- GCS backups past retention now get deleted. [#30565](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30565)\r\n- Added NetworkPolicy resources to system project-based namespaces to allow for Hardened CIS Scan to pass when Project Network Isolation is enabled. [30211](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30211)\r\n- Only delete Rancher-created NetworkPolicy resources when disabling Project Network Isolation. [#30135](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30135)\r\n- Domains in the AWS China region are now whitelisted to allow users to add and edit EKS clusters using cloud credentials associated with the AWS China region. [#29666](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29666)\r\n- Amazon EC2 nodes can now be automatically provisioned in the AWS Middle East region. [#31980](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31980)\r\n- PSP templates annotations are now properly applied to downstream cluster PSPs. Only annotations without names containing `.cattle.io/` are applied. [#22093](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/22093)\r\n\r\n# UI Updates\r\n\r\nThe primary UI in Rancher since v2.0 is now referred to as Cluster Manager in the UI. The new Cluster Explorer dashboard, experimentally released in Rancher 2.4, has graduated to GA status. There are new features only available in the new Cluster Explorer dashboard. There are some new features in the new UI with similar functionality as existing features in Cluster Manager, but differences in implementation may cause variation.\r\n\r\n## Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only one version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed the feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall it in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n |**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Provision Kubernetes v1.16 Clusters** | We have ended support for Kubernetes v1.16. Cluster Manager no longer provisions new v1.16 clusters. If you already have a v1.16 cluster, it is unaffected. |\r\n\r\n# Known Major Issues\r\n- Logging (Cluster Explorer): Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325)\r\n- Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539)\r\n- Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5. Please see above in Deprecated Features.\r\n- In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Monitoring in Cluster Manager v0.1.x. Clusters running k8s 1.15 and below will need to upgrade their k8s versions and leverage Monitoring in Cluster Manager v0.2.x or upgrade to Monitoring in Cluster Explorer.\r\n- Importing a Kubernetes v1.21 cluster might not work properly. We are planning to add support for Kubernetes v1.21 in the future.\r\n- When registering EKS and GKE clusters via Terraform, all unmanaged fields must be set to empty in order to avoid overriding configuration in the registered cluster. [#648](https://github.com/rancher/terraform-provider-rancher2/issues/648)\r\n- Deploying Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535)\r\n- Monitoring V2 fails to scrape ingress-nginx pods on any nodes except for the one Prometheus is deployed on if the security group used by worker nodes blocks incoming requests to port 10254. The workaround for this issue is to open up port 10254 on all hosts. [#32563](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32563)\r\n\r\n# Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm 3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI.\r\n- **Rancher Backup**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location, it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Monitoring**\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs. [#29171](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29171)\r\n- **Istio**\r\n  - When accessing tracing information for a service in the Kiali dashboard bundled with v1.9.3 and v1.8.5, attempting to change the display options may result in a persistent error for that service's tracing information. We recommend using the Jaeger dashboard if you would like different details for a particular services tracing until this issue is resolved. The resolution for this issue can be found in [#32330](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32330)\r\n  - Be aware that when upgrading from Istio 1.7.4 or earlier to any later version there may be connectivity issues. [Upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#connectivity-issues-among-your-proxies-when-updating-from-1-7-x-where-x-5) [#31811](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31811)\r\n  - Starting in v1.8.x, [DNS is supported natively](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#istio-coredns-plugin-deprecation). This means the additional addon component `istioCoreDNS` is deprecated in v1.8.x and is not supported in v1.9x. If you are upgrading from v1.8.x to v1.9.x and you are using the `istioCoreDNS` addon, it is recommended that you disable it and switch to the natively supported DNS prior to upgrade. If you upgrade without disabling it, you will need to manually clean up your installation as it will not get removed automatically. [#31761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31761) [#31265](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31265)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Cluster Manager Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n- **GKE**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabed in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312)\r\n  - When creating GKE clusters in Terraform, the `labels` field cannot be empty, at least one label must be set [#32553](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32553)\r\n- **EKS & GKE**\r\n  - When creating EKS and GKE clusters in Terraform, string fields cannot be set to empty.

and fixes. The default\r\nbranch for the Git repository has also been updated to `main`.\r\n\r\n#### Schema Annotations\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for _annotations_. Annotations allow users to declare metadata on rules and packages. Currently, OPA supports one form of metadata: schema declarations. For example:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\n# METADATA\r\n# schemas:\r\n# - input: schema.service\r\ndeny[\"service is missing required 'owner' label\"] {\r\n  input.kind == \"Service\"\r\n  not input.metadata.labels.owner\r\n}\r\n\r\n# METADATA\r\n# schemas:\r\n# - input: schema.deployment\r\ndeny[\"deployment replica count too low for 'production' namespace\"] {\r\n  input.kind == \"Deployment\"\r\n  input.metadata.namespace == \"production\"\r\n  object.get(input.spec, \"replicas\", 1) < 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can include schema annotations in their policies to tell OPA about the structure of external data loaded under `input` or `data`. By learning the schema of base documents, OPA can surface mistakes in the policy at authoring time (e.g., referring to a non-existent field in a JSON object or calling a built-in function with an invalid value.) For more information on the annotations and schema support see the [Type Checking](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/schemas/) page in the documentation. In the future, annotations will be expanded to support other kinds of metadata and additional tooling will be added to leverage them.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n- The server now automatically sets GOMAXPROCS when running inside of a container that has cgroups applied. This helps the Go runtime avoid consuming too many CPU resources and being throttled by the kernel. ([#3328](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3328))\r\n- The server now logs an error if users enable the `token` authentication mode without a corresponding authorization policy. ([#3380](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3380)) authored by @[kale-amruta](https://github.com/kale-amruta)\r\n- The server now supports a `GET /v1/config` endpoint that returns OPA's active configuration. This API is useful if you need to debug the running configuration in an OPA configured via Discovery. ([#2020](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2020))\r\n- The server now respects the `?pretty` option in the v0 API ([#3332](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3332)) authored by @[clarshad](https://github.com/clarshad)\r\n- The Bundle plugin is more forgiving when it comes to Etag processing on HTTP 304 responses ([#3361](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3361))\r\n- The Decision Log plugin now supports a \"Decision Per Second\" rate limit configuration setting.\r\n- The Status plugin can now be configured to use a custom reporter similar to the Decision Log plugin (e.g., so that Status messages can be sent to AWS Kinesis, etc.)\r\n- The Status plugin now reports the number of decision logs that are dropped due to buffer limits.\r\n- The service clients can authenticate with the Azure Identity OAuth2 implementation the client credentials JWT flow is used ([#3372](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3372))\r\n- Library users can now customize the logger used by the plugins by providing the `plugins.Logger` option when creating the plugin manager.\r\n\r\n### Tooling\r\n\r\n- The various OPA subcommands that accept schema files now accept a directory tree of schemas instead of only a single schema.\r\n- The `opa refactor move` subcommand was added to support package renaming use cases ([#3290](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3290))\r\n- The `opa check` subcommand now supports a `-s`/`--schema` flag like the `opa eval` subcommand.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- The [Management API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-introduction/) docs have been restructured so that each API has a dedicated page. In addition, the [Bundle API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-bundles/#implementations) docs now include getting started steps for cloud-provider specific services (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\n- OPA now supports PKCS8 encoded EC private keys for JWT verification (which includes service authentication, bundle verification, and verification built-in functions) ([#3283](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3283)). Authored by @[andrehaland](https://github.com/andrehaland).\r\n- The bundle signing and verification APIs have been updated to support custom signers/verififers ([#3336](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3336)). Authored by @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11).\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\n- The `time.diff` function was added to support calculating differences between date/time values ([#3348](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3348)) authored by @[andrehaland](https://github.com/andrehaland)\r\n- The `units.parse_bytes` function now supports floating-point values ([#3297](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3297)) authored by @[andy-paine](https://github.com/andy-paine)\r\n- The evaluator was fixed to use correct bindings when evaluating the full-extent of a partial rule set. This issue was causing unexpected undefined results and evaluation errors in some rare cases. ([#3369](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3369) [#3376](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3376))\r\n- The evaluator was fixed to correctly generate package paths when namespacing is disabled partial evaluation. ([#3302](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3302)).\r\n- The `http.send` function no longer errors out on invalid Expires headers. ([#3284](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3284))\r\n- The inter-query cache now serializes elements on insertion thereby reducing memory usage significantly (because deserialized elements carry a ~20x cost.) ([#3042](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3042))\r\n- The rule indexer was fixed to correctly handle mapped and non-mapped values which could occur with `glob.match` usage ([#3293](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3293))\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\n- The `opa eval` subcommand now correctly returns the set of all variable bindings and expression values when the `wasm` target is enabled. Previously it returned only set of variable bindings. ([#3281](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3281))\r\n- The `glob.match` function now handles the default delimiter correctly. ([#3294](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3294))\r\n- The `opa build` subcommand no longer requires a capabilities file when the `wasm` target is enabled. If capabilities are not provided, OPA will use the capabilities for its own version. ([#3270](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3270))\r\n- The `opa build` subcommand now dumps the IR emitted by the planner when `--debug` is specified.\r\n- The `opa eval` subcommand no longer panics when a policy fails to type check and the `wasm` target is enabled.\r\n- The comparison functions can now return `false` instead of either being `true` or `undefined`.  ([#3271](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3271))\r\n- The internal wasm runtime will now correctly return `CancelErr` to indicate cancellation errors (instead of `BuiltinErr` which it returned previously.)\r\n- The internal wasm runtime now correctly handles non-halt built-in errors ([#3320](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3320))\r\n- The planner no longer generates unexpected scan statements when negation used over base documents under `data` ([#3279](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3279)) and ([#3305](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3305))\r\n- The planner now correctly discards out-of-scope variables when exiting comprehensions ([#3325](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3325))\r\n- The `rego` package no longer panics when the `wasm` target is enabled and undefined functions are encountered ([#3251](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3251))\r\n- \ud83c\udf88 The remaining exceptions in the e2e test framework for the internal wasm runtime have been resolved.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- The `make image` target now uses the CI image for building the Go binary. This avoids platform-specific build issues by building the Go binary inside of Docker.", "created_at": "2021-04-27T13:32:14Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.1.0", "tag_name": "v3.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/releases/tag/v3.1.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere", "body": "", "created_at": "2021-04-26T02:09:03Z", "project": "kubesphere", "repo": "kubesphere/kubesphere", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Flux 1.22.2", "tag_name": "1.22.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/releases/tag/1.22.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux", "body": "## 1.22.2 (2021-04-23)\r\n\r\nThis release bundles migration-related documentation updates with some minor fixes, and tracks Kustomize to the end of its v3.8 minor release series.

After inspection, it was observed that the SUM and the\nGROUP_CONCAT functions missed the necessary no_rows_in_result()\nimplementations.

Especially, most of the major items are driven by community users to enhance and improve Longhorn functionalities and stability. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- Automatic Longhorn Engine Upgrade\r\n  - Before v1.1.1, for live engine image upgrade, users only can manually upgrade the engine image of each healthy volume. v1.1.1 supports this to avoid needless user intervention [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/auto-uprade-engine/)]\r\n- Virtual Machine Volume Support\r\n  - Virtual machine volume creation by Longhorn backing image [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/advanced-resources/backing-image/)]\r\n  - Backing image management native support without any 3rd-party image repository [[LEP](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20210305-backing-image.md)]\r\n  - Virtual machine live migration support by Longhorn migratable RWO volume [[LEP](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20210216-volume-live-migration.md)]\r\n  - Ability to use as a volume storage service by virtualization orchestration solutions like [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io/)\r\n- Granular Resource Reservation for Longhorn Engine/Replica\r\n  - Before v1.1.1, users only can configure a global setting for CPU resource reservation for each engine/replica. v1.1.1 supports granular node-specific settings for each engine/replica individually. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/best-practices/#guaranteed-instance-manager-cpu)]\r\n- AWS IAM Role Support to Generate Temporary AWS credentials\r\n  - Besides using IAM user credentials, v1.1.1 allows users to configure IAM Assume Role to generate temporary credentials by AWS security token service to do the backup and restore operations. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/set-backup-target/#set-up-aws-s3-backupstore)]\r\n- Longhorn Frontend WebSocket Performance Enhancement to Improve User Experience\r\n  - Improves the UI performance to adopt event-driven data update to reduce needless network traffic caused by frequently pulling the updated info from the backend.\r\n- Dependency Installation Manifests for Node Prerequisites\r\n  - Comes out with some installation manifests for prerequisites (like iSCSI and NFS client libraries). It's not integrated into the Longhorn installation process, but it's optional and helpful for users to prepare the environment ready for Longhorn.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher catalog, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n### Automatic Longhorn Engine Upgrade supported\r\n\r\nBesides manually upgrading Longhorn engines, it's able to do automatic engine upgrades with configurable settings and conditions.\r\n\r\n**Concurrent Automatic Engine Upgrade Per Node Limit Setting**\r\n\r\n- Controls the maximum number of engines per node that are allowed to automatically upgrade to the default engine image at the same time. The default value is 0, so Longhorn will not automatically upgrade volumes\u2019 engines to the default version by default. If configured, we recommend setting the value to 3 to leave some room for error but don\u2019t overwhelm the system with too many failed upgrades. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#concurrent-automatic-engine-upgrade-per-node-limit)]\r\n  \r\n**Conditions of Automatic Engine Upgrade**\r\n\r\nIf the value of `Concurrent Automatic Engine Upgrade Per Node Limit Setting` is bigger than 0, in the below conditions, the automatic engine upgrade will happen.\r\n\r\n- Healthy attached volumes - Live upgrade\r\n- Detached volumes - Offline upgrade\r\n\r\nBut, Longhorn doesn\u2019t automatically upgrade disaster recovery volumes to the new default engine image because it would trigger a full restoration for the disaster recovery volumes. The full restoration might affect the performance of other running Longhorn volumes in the system, so we leave it to users to decide to do manual engine upgrades at the appropriate time. For the detailed, check [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/auto-uprade-engine/)]\r\n\r\n### Engine Manager CPU Request and Replica Manager CPU Request introduced, but Guaranteed Engine CPU deprecated\r\n\r\nThe new node-specific `Engine Manager CPU Request` and `Replica Manager CPU Request` reservations are introduced, and the existing `Guaranteed Engine CPU` gets deprecated. To avoid crashing existing volumes after Longhorn Manager upgrade, the deprecated setting `Guaranteed Engine CPU` will be automatically set `Engine Manager CPU Request` and `Replica Manager CPU Request` from each node based on the deprecated setting value during the upgrade. Then, the new global instance manager CPU settings Guaranteed Engine Manager CPU and Guaranteed Replica Manager CPU won\u2019t take effect. \r\n\r\nFor the detailed, check [[doc: post-upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/deploy/upgrade/longhorn-manager/#post-upgrade)], [[doc: guaranteed-engine-manager-cpu](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#guaranteed-engine-manager-cpu)], and [[doc: guaranteed-replica-manager-cpu](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.1/references/settings/#guaranteed-replica-manager-cpu)]\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n  \r\n  -

([#4595](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4595), [@maybe-sybr](https://github.com/maybe-sybr))\r\n - Added `container_runtime_crio_containers_oom_total` and  `container_runtime_crio_containers_oom` metrics,\r\n  which collects out of memory (oom) containers. ([#4690](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4690), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added `crio-status.8` man page to static release bundle ([#4510](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4510), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added arm64 variant to static binary bundle. The bundle is now available via the URL\r\n  `https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-conform-cri-o/artifacts/cri-o.$ARCH.$VERSION.tar.gz`,\r\n  where `$ARCH` can be `amd64` or `arm64` and `$VERSION` a tag or full length git SHA.\r\n  Beside that, we provide a new installation script\r\n  `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cri-o/cri-o/master/scripts/get | bash`.\r\n  For this script, it is also possible to pass the architecture and version as arguments:\r\n  `get [amd64|arm64] [VERSION|SHA]`.\r\n  The static binary bundle now uses crun as default container runtime for CRI-O. ([#4552](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4552), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added feature to allow the OCI seccomp BPF hook to trace containers into dedicated files by\r\n  using the annotation key `io.containers.trace-syscall/container-name` ([#4544](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4544), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Bump containers image to v5.10.1 ([#4519](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4519), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))\r\n - CRI-O does not return `<none>` placeholders for missing tags and digests any more when doing a `ListImages` RPC ([#4673](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4673), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Changed `VersionResponse.RuntimeApiVersion` to return either the `v1alpha2` or `v1` CRI API version ([#4473](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4473), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Fall back to search registries list if short name alias is not found in the alias table. ([#4730](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4730), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))\r\n - Fix a bug where pods with `hostNetwork: true` couldn't have ports forwarded from them when drop_infra_ctr=true ([#4495](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4495), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - It is possible to override cgroup v2 unified configuration through the io.kubernetes.cri-o.UnifiedCgroup.$CTR_NAME annotation ([#4479](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4479), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))\r\n - Port-forward works for IPv6 only pods ([#4639](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4639), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))\r\n - Provide a new configuration flag to specify CPUs that will be used to run infra containers ([#4459](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4459), [@cynepco3hahue](https://github.com/cynepco3hahue))\r\n - Support Container Runtime Interface (CRI) security profiles for seccomp, which has been introduced with Kubernetes v1.20.0 and the graduation of the CRI. ([#4358](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4358), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Support enabling pprof profile over CRI-O's unix socket ([#4514](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4514), [@mrunalp](https://github.com/mrunalp))\r\n - \"crio config\" only prints the fields that are different than the default configuration. ([#4682](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4682), [@ityuhui](https://github.com/ityuhui))\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n - Add support for customizing container specs based on workloads. Each workload has an activation_annotation that, when present, activates the specific workload. Then, each workload has the option to configure different resources. Resources can have default values, or require that they're specified for each individual container. This is done by annotation, which is of the form `$annotation_prefix.$resource_name/$container_name`, where annotation_prefix is configured for the particular workload, resource_name corresponds to the resource being configured, and container name is the container in a pod that should have its resource configured. ([#4725](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4725), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n - The installed cri-o.service file now attempts to be run before kubelet.service ([#4443](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4443), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - Fix a bug where CollectMode wouldn't be set if the feature was backported to systemd (in RHEL/CentOS 7, for instance) ([#4563](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4563), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where containers didn't have a finished time set when using the \"vm\" style runtimes. ([#4468](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4468), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where crio wipe incorrectly wiped container storage even though the node wasn't rebooted ([#4691](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4691), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where pods or containers could be cleaned up out of order if the request timed out ([#4722](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4722), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix running privileged systemd containers with bidirectional mounts ([#4575](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4575), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))\r\n - Fixed a bug that could cause CRI-O to segfault when a node is under heavy load ([#4530](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4530), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fixed a bug which would cause configuration files to not be reloaded properly on SIGHUP when one or more \"drop-in\" configuration files were being used. ([#4694](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4694), [@nalind](https://github.com/nalind))\r\n - Ingress/Egress burst limit is now set slightly below 4GB, which properly sets 4GB as the upper limit of burst ([#4348](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4348), [@zizon](https://github.com/zizon))\r\n - Instead of failing to start, CRI-O now only prints a warning and ignores the runtime, in case a **non*- default runtime is misconfigured. ([#4631](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4631), [@fidencio](https://github.com/fidencio))\r\n - Some fields in the crio configuration related to storage and images were commented out by default (when running `crio config`). They have been uncommented, and will be applied (if they're different from the default value). ([#4748](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4748), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - When dropping the infra container, the container inspect endpoint now returns a PID when requesting the infra container. ([#4613](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4613), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)\r\n - Add clean_shutdown_file option to allow crio/crio wipe to verify crio had time to shutdown cleanly ([#3999](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/3999), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Add metric to grab latency for individual CRI calls. ([#4598](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4598), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))\r\n - Fixed version log timestamp when starting CRI-O ([#4724](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4724), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Log the container stop timeout at default log level ([#4549](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4549), [@mrunalp](https://github.com/mrunalp))\r\n\r\n#### Uncategorized\r\n - Allows users to set stream timeout from config ([#4529](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4529), [@wgahnagl](https://github.com/wgahnagl))\r\n - CRI-O now supports short-name aliases which can be configured in the `containers-registries.conf(5)` configuration files.  Please refer to the following article for further details on short-name aliases: www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names\r\n  \r\n  The `registries` option in the crio.conf has been deprecated and takes no effect any more.  CRI-O will warn when loading the config and note that `containers-registries.conf(5)` should be used instead for configuring unqualified-search registries. ([#4455](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4455), [@vrothberg](https://github.com/vrothberg))\r\n - Cri-o managed scopes now depend on the shutdown.target and network.target to allow graceful shutdowns. ([#4654](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4654), [@rphillips](https://github.com/rphillips))\r\n - Crio adds info level log of the physical image source. ([#4438](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4438), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))\r\n - Fix OOMs when using crun together with CPU Manager ([#4592](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4592), [@odinuge](https://github.com/odinuge))\r\n - Fixed a bug where image authentication failed from not finding the auth file. ([#4461](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4461), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))\r\n - Set conmon scope KillSignal to SIGPIPE ([#4560](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4560), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - This new release of ocicrypt contains new usable interfaces and thus is a new minor number. This issue details the notable features added as well as a checklist before making a new release that will be used by consuming projects. Target date for completion is 24th January.\r\n  \r\n  Changes\r\n  There are several significant changes in release 1.1.0, this includes:\r\n      - Experimental PKCS11 support enabled via ENV variable\r\n      - Custom keyprovider support enabled via ENV variable ([#4537](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4537), [@pravinrajr9](https://github.com/pravinrajr9))\r\n - Update nix pin with `make nixpkgs` ([#4395](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4395), [@hswong3i](https://github.com/hswong3i))\r\n - When using high performance hooks, CRI-O now restarts the irqbalance service after updating the irqbalance config file. rather than calling `irqbalance --oneshot`. A new config value `irqbalance_config_file` has been introduced to configure the file to update with `IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS` settings. The default of this config value is `/etc/sysconfig/irqbalance`, but must be set to `/etc/default/irqbalance` for Ubuntu-like distributions. ([#4441](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4441), [@pperiyasamy](https://github.com/pperiyasamy))\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- github.com/Knetic/govaluate:

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
