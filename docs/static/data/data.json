This platform implementation should be relatively stable and reliable, but breaking changes in the underlying [specification](https://github.com/buildpack/spec) may be implemented without notice.

See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1780).\r\n* FEATURE: add [limit_offset](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#limit_offset) function, which can be used for implementing simple paging over big number of time series. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1778).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: allow groups with empty rules list like Prometheus does. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1742).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: allow groups with default `tenant` in `-clusterMode`. Default `tenant` values can be specified via `-defaultTenant.prometheus` and `-defaultTenant.graphite`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#multitenancy).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `collapse` and `expand` buttons per each group of targets with the same `job_name` at `http://vmagent:8429/targets` page.\r\n* FEATURE: automatically detect timestamp precision (ns, us, ms or s) for the data ingested into VictoriaMetrics via [InfluxDB line protocol](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add ability to protect `/config` page with auth key via `-configAuthKey` command-line flag. This page may contain sensitive config information, so it may be good to restrict access to this page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1764).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: hide passwords and auth tokens at `/config` page like Prometheus does. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1764).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `-promscrape.maxResponseHeadersSize` command-line flag for tuning the maximum HTTP response headers size for Prometheus scrape targets.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: send data to multiple configured remote storage systems in parallel (e.g. when multiple `-remoteWrite.url` flag values are specified). This should improve data ingestion speed.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `-remoteWrite.maxRowsPerBlock` command-line flag for tuning the number of samples to send to remote storage per each block. Bigger values may improve data ingestion performance at the cost of higher memory usage.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: distribute Kafka messages among all the partitions when [writing data to Kafka](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#writing-metrics-to-kafka).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: reduce the increased memory usage when scraping targets with big number of metrics which periodically change. The memory usage has been increased in v1.68.0 after vmagent started generating staleness markers in [stream parse mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode). See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1745).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: properly display `proxy_url` config option at `http://vmagent:8429/config` page. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1755).\r\n* BUGFIX: fix tests for Apple M1.

When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.\r\n* There is [an issue](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4400) that affects k3s when deploying on dual-stack mode on hosts with a kernel version older than 5.1, the IPv6 external-ip exposed by the service LB does not work correctly.\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.22.2+k3s2:\r\n\r\n* Updated Kubernetes to v1.22.3 [(#4348)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4348)\r\n* Added dual-stack support LB controller [(#4160)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4160)\r\n* New aliases for k3s etcd-snapshot s3 commands to match the flags used with k3s server [(#4170)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4170) [(#4282)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4282)\r\n* Set skip SSL verification for etcd snapshots if skip ssl verify flag is passed [(#4103)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4103)\r\n* Display cluster tls error only in debug mode [(#4200)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4200)\r\n* Ensured that node address labels are set before initializing the node with the integrated cloud provider [(#4222)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4222)\r\n* Added `--timeout` option to etcd-snapshot command to allow increasing the time allowed for snapshot uploads to complete [(#4230)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4230)\r\n* K3s should now reliably exit when core Kubernetes components (apiserver, controller-manager, etc) experience fatal errors [(#4241)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4241)\r\n* K3s now waits until etcd is actually able to start before joining a new members to the embedded etcd clusters [(#4245)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4245)\r\n* Fixed an issue that caused k3s to not be restarted by systemd when started with the `--log` flag [(#4235)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4235)\r\n* Updated flannel to v0.15.1 [(#4265)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4265)\r\n* Updated helm-controller and klipper-helm to time out the `helm_v2 ls --all` that is done to check for deprecated helm chart versions [(#4291)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4291)\r\n* Fixed a problem in etcd cluster-reset by updating the peer addresses [(#4305)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4305)\r\n* When using the integrated cloud provider, ensure that the scheduler doesn't start before at least one node in the cluster has been initialized [(#4361)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4361)\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.22.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#v1223) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.8.0](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.8.0) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.36.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_36_0.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.5.0-k3s2](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.0-k3s2) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.5.7-k3s2](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.7-k3s2) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.15.1](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.15.1) | \r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.5.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.5.0) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.5.0](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.5.0) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.8.4](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.8.4) | \r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.11.7](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.11.7) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.20](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.20) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

See [#35164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35164).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- The API Server has been updated to fix slow consumers causing deadlocks. See [#34907](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34907).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/).\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n- **RKE Requirements:** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)`, please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).  \r\n- **EKS requirements:** There was a setting for Rancher versions prior to 2.5.8 allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: eks-refresh-cron. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: eks-refresh. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **Fleet-agent:** When upgrading `<=v2.5.7` to `>=v2.5.8`, you may notice that in app & marketplace there is a fleet-agent release stuck at uninstalling. This is caused by migrating fleet-agent release name. It is safe to delete fleet-agent release as it is no longer used and it should not delete the real fleet-agent deployment since it has been migrated. See [#362](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/362).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Upgrades and Rollbacks:** Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback. Please note the version you would like to upgrade or rollback to change the Rancher version.\r\n  - Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n  - Existing GKE clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. Refer to the documentation for the new instructions.\r\n- **Important**: When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see the documentation.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.5.11\r\n- rancher/rancher-agent:v2.5.11\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.11](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.11)\r\n- RKE - [v1.2.14](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.2.14)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- 1.20.12 (Default)\r\n- 1.19.16\r\n- 1.18.20\r\n- 1.17.17\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Provision Kubernetes v1.16 Clusters** | We have ended support for Kubernetes v1.16. Cluster Manager no longer provisions new v1.16 clusters. If you already have a v1.16 cluster, it is unaffected. |\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only one version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed the feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall it in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm 3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI.\r\n- **Rancher Backup**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location, it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Monitoring**\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs. [#29171](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29171)\r\n- **Istio**\r\n  - When accessing tracing information for a service in the Kiali dashboard bundled with v1.9.3 and v1.8.5, attempting to change the display options may result in a persistent error for that service's tracing information. We recommend using the Jaeger dashboard if you would like different details for a particular services tracing until this issue is resolved. The resolution for this issue can be found in [#32330](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32330)\r\n  - Be aware that when upgrading from Istio 1.7.4 or earlier to any later version there may be connectivity issues. [Upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#connectivity-issues-among-your-proxies-when-updating-from-1-7-x-where-x-5) [#31811](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31811)\r\n  - Starting in v1.8.x, [DNS is supported natively](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#istio-coredns-plugin-deprecation). This means the additional addon component `istioCoreDNS` is deprecated in v1.8.x and is not supported in v1.9x. If you are upgrading from v1.8.x to v1.9.x and you are using the `istioCoreDNS` addon, it is recommended that you disable it and switch to the natively supported DNS prior to upgrade. If you upgrade without disabling it, you will need to manually clean up your installation as it will not get removed automatically. [#31761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31761) [#31265](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31265)\r\n\r\n### Cluster Manager Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n- **GKE**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabed in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312)\r\n  - When creating GKE clusters in Terraform, the `labels` field cannot be empty, at least one label must be set [#32553](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32553)\r\n- **EKS & GKE**\r\n  - When creating EKS and GKE clusters in Terraform, string fields cannot be set to empty. [#32440](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32440)\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions**\r\n  - **RKE**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539)    \r\n    - After migrating from the in-tree vSphere cloud provider to the out-of-tree cloud provider, attempts to upgrade the cluster will not complete. This is due to nodes containing workloads with bound volumes before the migration failing to drain. Users will observe these nodes stuck in a `draining` state. Follow this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102#issuecomment-943493870) to continue with the upgrade. See [#35102](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102).\r\n- **Cluster Tools**\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster. \r\n  - **Monitoring**\r\n  - Deploying Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - Monitoring V2 fails to scrape ingress-nginx pods on any nodes except for the one Prometheus is deployed on if the security group used by worker nodes blocks incoming requests to port 10254. The workaround for this issue is to open up port 10254 on all hosts. See [#32563](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32563).\r\n  - **Logging**\r\n    - Logging (Cluster Explorer): Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring**\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n  - **Installation Requirements**\r\n    - Importing a Kubernetes v1.21 cluster might not work properly.

To enable it the flag `buffer_implementation` should be set to `keyspace_events`.\r\nThe existing implementation (flag value `healthcheck`) will be deprecated in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n### CLI command output\r\nWherever CLI commands produced `master` or `MASTER` for tablet type, they now produce `primary` or `PRIMARY`.\r\nScripts and tools that depend on parsing command output will need to change.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```sh\r\n$ vtctlclient -server localhost:15999 ListAllTablets \r\nzone1-0000000100 sourcekeyspace 0 primary 192.168.0.134:15100 192.168.0.134:17100 [] 2021-09-24T01:12:00Z\r\nzone1-0000000101 sourcekeyspace 0 rdonly 192.168.0.134:15101 192.168.0.134:17101 [] <null>\r\nzone1-0000000102 sourcekeyspace 0 replica 192.168.0.134:15102 192.168.0.134:17102 [] <null>\r\nzone1-0000000103 sourcekeyspace 0 rdonly 192.168.0.134:15103 192.168.0.134:17103 [] <null>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Default Behaviour Changes\r\n\r\n### Enabling reserved connections\r\nUse of reserved connections is controlled by the vtgate flag `-enable_system_settings`. This flag has in the past defaulted to `false` (or `OFF`) in release versions (i.e. x.0 and x.0.y) of Vitess, and to `true` (or `ON`) in development versions.\r\n\r\nFrom Vitess 12.0.0 onwards, it defaults to ***true*** in all release and development versions. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/9125). Hence you should specify this flag explicitly, so that you are sure whether it is enabled or not, regardless of which Vitess release/build/version you are running.\r\n\r\nIf you have reserved connections disabled, you will get the ***old*** Vitess behavior: where most system settings (e.g. `sql_mode`) are just silently ignored by Vitess. In situations where you know your backend MySQL defaults are acceptable, this may be the correct setting to ensure the best possible performance of the vttablet <-> MySQL connection pools. This comes down to a trade-off between compatibility and performance/scalability. You should also review [this section](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/query-serving/reserved-conn/#number-of-vttablet---mysql-connections) of the documentation when deciding whether or not to enable reserved connections.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n### CLI commands\r\n`VExec` is deprecated and removed. All Online DDL commands should be run through `OnlineDDL`.\r\n\r\n`OnlineDDL revert` is deprecated. Use `REVERT VITESS_MIGRATION '...'` SQL command either via `ApplySchema` or via `vtgate`.\r\n\r\n`InitShardMaster` is deprecated, use `InitShardPrimary` instead.\r\n\r\n`SetShardIsMasterServing` is deprecated, use `SetShardIsPrimaryServing` instead.\r\n\r\nVarious command flags have been deprecated and new variants provided.\r\n* `DeleteTablet` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `PlannedReparentShard` flag `avoid_master` replaced with `avoid_tablet`\r\n* `PlannedReparentShard` flag `new_master` replaced with `new_primary`\r\n* `BackupShard` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `Backup` flag `allow_master` replaced with `allow_primary`\r\n* `EmergencyReparentShard` flag `new_master` replaced with `new_primary`\r\n* `ReloadSchemeShard` flag `include_master` replaced with `include_primary`\r\n* `ReloadSchemaKeyspace` flag `include_master` replaced with `include_primary`\r\n* `ValidateSchemaKeyspace` flag `skip-no-master` replaced with `skip-no-primary`\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n### Query Serving\r\n* Add `SHOW VITESS_REPLICATION_STATUS` Query Support #8900 \r\n  * The new `SHOW VITESS_REPLICATION_STATUS` command/query shows the MySQL replica/replication (not `vreplication`) health for the vitess deployment.\r\n\r\n## Governance\r\n* Added @GuptaManan100 to maintainers #8833\r\n\r\n------------\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n#### Build/CI\r\n * Update golang/x dependencies #8688\r\n * tests: use AtomicInt32 instead of int to fix races #8696\r\n#### Cluster management\r\n * Use consul lock properly #8310\r\n * Trivial: mysqlctl reinit_config -h  was not showing help #8369\r\n * Port #8422 to main branch #8745\r\n * [vtctl] Add missing call to `flag.Parse` in `commandGetRoutingRules` #8795\r\n * Fix for padding in OrderAndCheckPartitions  #8873\r\n * tabletmanager: correct implementations of deprecated RPCs for backwards compatibility #9059\r\n#### General\r\n * Avoid some pollution of CLI argument namespace across vtgate and vttablet #9026\r\n#### Observability\r\n * schema engine: reset table size stats when a table is dropped #8634\r\n#### Query Serving\r\n * Fix for function calls in DEFAULT value of CREATE TABLE statement in main #8477\r\n * Fixing multiple issues related to onlineddl/lifecycle #8500\r\n * boolean values should not be parenthesised in default clause #8502\r\n * mysql/server: abort connection if secure transport is required #8504\r\n * Clear only the current shard's schemacopy rows  during schema reload #8519\r\n * go/mysql/auth: fix error message for wrong auth method. #8525\r\n * Fix handshake protocol with MySQL client #8537\r\n * Copy parameter data from byte buffer in COM_STMT_SEND_LONG_DATA #8562\r\n * Negative float default #8587\r\n * [vtexplain] prevent panic on show tables/show full tables #8601\r\n * OnlineDDL: better scheduling/cancellation logic #8603\r\n * Fix parsing of FIRST clause in ALTER TABLE #8614\r\n * onlineddl Executor: build schema with DBA user #8624\r\n * Handle subquery merging with references correctly #8662\r\n * Fixing error on deletes from owning table for a lookup being populated by CreateLookupVindex after a SwitchWrites #8701\r\n * Fixing a panic in vtgate with OLAP mode #8722\r\n * default to primary tablet if not set in VStream api #8755\r\n * Fix bug in parsing of version comments #8770\r\n * Proper merge of the SysTableTableName fields when joining two routes #8771\r\n * fix parsing of MySQL Server Version flag #8791\r\n * Fix typo in pool config syntax.

Instance metadata service version 2\r\n\r\n On AWS, kOps will enable [Instance Metadata Service Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) and require tokens on new clusters with Kubernetes 1.22. In addition, the following max hop limits will be set by default:\r\n\r\n * worker and API server Nodes, and bastions, will have a limit of 1 hop.\r\n * control plane nodes will have a limit of 3 hops to accommodate for controller Pods without host networking that need to assume roles.\r\n\r\nThis will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  instanceMetadata:\r\n    httpTokens: optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External ServiceAccountPermissions\r\n\r\nMany of kOps addons can now make direct use of external permissions.\r\nThis can be enabled by adding the following to the Cluster spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  iam:\r\n    useServiceAccountExternalPermissions: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only available using the AWS cloud provider.\r\n\r\n## Managed nvidia instances\r\n\r\nkOps can now provision instances with nvidia GPUs and configure it for container workloads without the need of hooks and operators. See [GPU support](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/gpu/)\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* New clusters on AWS will no longer provision an SSH public key by default. To provision\r\n  an SSH public key on a new cluster, use the `--ssh-public-key` flag to `kops create cluster`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. This defers changes to these files until the time of `terraform apply`.\r\n  This feature may be temporarily disabled by turning off the `TerraformManagedFiles` feature flag\r\n  using `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=\"-TerraformManagedFiles\"`.\r\n\r\n* kOps now implements graceful rotation of its Certificate Authorities and the service\r\n  account signing key. See the documentation on [How to rotate all secrets / credentials](../operations/rotate-secrets.md)\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports Debian 11 (Bullseye).\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) as a drop-in replacement for dns-controller.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Control plane pods no longer mount /srv/kubernetes\r\n\r\n For security reasons, `/srv/kubernetes` is no longer mounted in the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager Pods. This also means the files in the default file assets path will be unavailable. If you have file assets or other files needed by kube-apiserver, you must put these into `/srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/` or `/srv/kubernetes/kube-controller-manager`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor file assets, it means adding an explicit path as shown below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  fileAssets:\r\n  - name: audit-policy-config\r\n    path: /srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/audit-policy-config.yaml # make sure you add the path\r\n    roles:\r\n    - Master\r\n    content: |\r\n      apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\r\n      kind: Policy\r\n      rules:\r\n      - level: Metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The legacy addons from `https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons` have been deprecated and will not be available in Kubernetes 1.23+. Use [managed addons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons) instead.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The `assets` phase of `kops update cluster` has been removed. It is replaced by the new `kops get assets --copy` command.\r\n\r\n* Support for importing and converting kubeup clusters has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Cilium and RHEL 8 has been removed. Cilium users will need to migrate to a distribution with a newer Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n* Amazon Linux 2 users are encouraged to use the AMIs based on the 5.10 Linux kernel. See [the documentation](../operations/images.md#amazon-linux-2) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Terraform support now requires Terraform >=0.15.0.\r\n  Users on older versions must follow Terraform's recommended upgrade path of applying one minor version at a time prior to running `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. If, after upgrading kOps and applying a new Terraform plan,\r\n  you subsequently downgrade to an earlier version of kOps, the generated plan will delete these\r\n  files, breaking the cluster. Prior to applying the plan, you will need to orphan all the\r\n  `aws_s3_bucket_object` objects the plan wants to destroy. Use `terraform state rm` on each of them.\r\n  Then re-run `terraform plan` until there are no such objects in the plan.\r\n  \r\n  If you applied the plan without first orphaning all of these objects, fix the cluster by re-running\r\n  `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users of clusters with names beginning with digits will need to move resources prior to upgrading to kOps 1.22. Some of the following commands will need to be run depending on the particular cluster configuration. Confirm the Terraform plan doesn't destroy any of these resources before running `terraform apply`.\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # View the existing terraform resource names for the exact value to use\r\n  HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME=123-cluster-example-com\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_internet_gateway.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_internet_gateway.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_route_table.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_route_table.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* The `TerraformJSON` feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23. Only native HCL2 Terraform output will be supported.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* Support for shell completion has been substantially improved. kOps has added support for shell completion in `fish` and `PowerShell`.\r\n\r\n* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.\r\n\r\n* There is a new command `kops get assets` for listing image and file assets used by a cluster.\r\n  It also includes a `--copy` flag to copy the assets to local repositories.\r\n  See the documentation on [Using local asset repositories](../operations/asset-repository.md) for more information.\r\n  \r\n* kOps now provisions TLS server certificates signed by the Kubernetes general CA to kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.\r\n  The previous behavior of using self-signed certs may be restored by setting `kubeControllerManager.tlsCertFile` and/or\r\n  `kubeScheduler.tlsCertFile` to `\"\"` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now supports the wireguard protocol for transparent encryption.\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.22.0 release\r\n\r\n* Release 1.22.0 [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#12532](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12532)\r\n* Don't hard-code the SQS Queue ARN partition [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet)

For example, the following are equivalent:  $(param.myparam), $(param['myparam']), and $(param[\"myparam\"]). Bracket notation has the additional benefit of allowing users to work with parameter names containing conflicting characters like \".\" (e.g. $(param['my.param']) or $(param[\"my.param\"]).\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Promoting \"onError\" to beta \ud83c\udf93 (#4251)\r\n\r\nAnnouncement: onError in a step is now stable and available to include in your task definition without any flag. \r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* :bug: Verify failure of `PipelineRun` in `TestGitPipelineRunFail`  (#4273)\r\n* :bug: release: Drop windows from pipeline-wide platforms (#4308)\r\n* :bug: Don't pass the pipeline's default platforms value to the publish-image task (#4305)\r\n* :bug: release: Include windows in pipeline default platforms (#4304)\r\n* :bug: nightly: Configure auth before pushing combined base image (#4302)\r\n* :bug: Fix nightly release process (#4301)\r\n* :bug: Updates webhook cluster role to work with Owner References (#4269)\r\n* :bug: Ignore env var ordering in taskrun reconciler tests (#4286)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Remove unused error type CannotConvertError (#4281)\r\n\r\nRemove unused error type CannotConvertError\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Split /tekton/run directories into separate volumes.

This was slow for\nseveral reasons:\n\n* Type inference is generally slow for large collections (hash/array)\n* Iterable functions like `reduce` pass an accumulator to the block for each\n  iteration, so we inferred the accumulator's type multiple times.\n* When building a collection using `reduce`, the accumulator increases in size\n  each time. So constructions like the following infer the type of an\n  accumulator of size 0, 1, ..., N-1, which is equivalent to inferring the type\n  of an accumulator of size N(N-1)/2:\n\n      Integer[1, N].reduce([]) |$memo, $value| { $memo << $value}\n\nHowever, block arguments are often defined without a type, e.g. `$memo`, so the\ntype inference was wasted effort.\n\nThis commit switches from `callable?` to `callable_with?`. So rather than\ninferring the type of all arguments, and checking if those types are assignable\nto the parameter's type, we instead check if each argument is an instance of the\nparameter's type. For example, we check if the Ruby Hash {} is an instance of\nthe `PAnyType`, which is always true[1]. The `callable_with?` method also checks\nrequired and optional parameters and return types, like the `callable?` method\ndoes.\n\nNote the `callable_with?` method was introduced in 2edd30e0 to address similar\ntype inference slowness.\n\n[1] https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/7.11.0/lib/puppet/pops/types/types.rb#L268", "created_at": "2021-10-08T17:56:39Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Longhorn v1.2.2 release", "tag_name": "v1.2.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.2.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "## Release Note\r\n\r\n> Please read the install/upgrade notes before installing/upgrading to this Longhorn version.\r\n\r\n**v1.2.2 released!** \ud83c\udf86\r\n\r\nThis release introduces important bug fixes as described below.

This has been achieved via migration to the latest Kubernetes constructs, ease of use improvements, bug fixes and most importantly refactoring the control plane and e2e test suites to independently enhance and release each of the engines. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them till Dec 2021. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.0.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.0.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.8.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.5.1 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.7.1 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.7.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.4.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.7 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Added support for pushing the [container images to GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/packages), in addition to pushing the to DockerHub and Quay.io.\r\n* Rename the branches to \"develop\" or \"main\" on all the active repositories which are accepting contributions. \r\n* Update the CRD references to v1 across all components - even with deprecated provisioners - so users can continue to use the older provisioners beyond 1.22 as well. \r\n* Update the Kubernetes CSI driver side-cars to the latest version compatible with Kubernetes 1.18 and higher. \r\n* Enhance the iSCSI Targets functionality in Jiva and cStor volumes to only accept connections from one node at a time. The connection from a new node will be accepted only after the previous connection is torn down. \r\n* Enhanced the Local PV hostpath with a feature to enforce capacity limits using XFS quota - for volumes provisioned on XFS filesystem. \r\n* Enhanced the Jiva Specs (Jiva Volume Policy) to remove unused fields and make most of the fields with default configuration as optional. Also fixed the issues around specifying pod affinity and anti-affinity policies on jiva replica and target.\r\n* Enhanced the NDM operator and helm chart to include NDM exporter. \r\n* Enhanced NDM to detect filesystem and size changes, and update the block device resource. (under feature-gate in this release).\r\n* Dashboard and CLI have made enhanced their support to display details about cStor, Jiva, ZFS, LVM and Device Local PV. \r\n* Enhanced OpenEBS helm chart that can easily enable or disable a data engine of choice. The 3.0 helm chart stops installing the legacy cstor and jiva provisioners. If you would like to continue to use them, you have to set the flag \u201clegacy.enabled=true\u201d. \r\n* OpenEBS helm chart includes sample kyverno policies that can be used as an option for PodSecurityPolicies(PSP) replacement. \r\n* New revamped website for [https://openebs.io](https://openebs.io) is live. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @turowicz(Surveily), @WillyRL(Teknologi Anak Rantau Indonesia), @Somsubhra1, @t3hmrman for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Chunks storage has been deprecated and is now in maintenance mode.\r\n* Exemplars now supported - in-memory only.\r\n* Added many new limits, to help protect your installation against overload.\r\n* The sharding feature in Alertmanager is now considered complete.\r\n* Release now has ARM binaries and packages (but not container images, yet).\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Prevent path traversal attack from users able to control the HTTP header `X-Scope-OrgID`. #4375 (CVE-2021-36157)\r\n  * Users only have control of the HTTP header when Cortex is not frontended by an auth proxy validating the tenant IDs\r\n* [CHANGE] Enable strict JSON unmarshal for `pkg/util/validation.Limits` struct. The custom `UnmarshalJSON()` will now fail if the input has unknown fields. #4298\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage. No new features will be added to the chunks storage. The default Cortex configuration still runs the chunks engine; please check out the [blocks storage doc](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/) on how to configure Cortex to run with the blocks storage.  #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] The example Kubernetes manifests (stored at `k8s/`) have been removed due to a lack of proper support and maintenance. #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: deprecated `-store.query-chunk-limit` CLI flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`) in favour of `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`). The new limit specifies the maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query from ingesters and long-term storage: the total number of actual fetched chunks could be 2x the limit, being independently applied when querying ingesters and long-term storage. #4125\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: allowed to configure the experimental receivers firewall on a per-tenant basis. The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been changed and moved to the limits config section: #4143\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-cidr-networks`\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-private-addresses`\r\n* [CHANGE] Change default value of `-server.grpc.keepalive.min-time-between-pings` from `5m` to `10s` and `-server.grpc.keepalive.ping-without-stream-allowed` to `true`. #4168\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change default value of `-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` to `true`. This incurs a small increase in memory usage, between 1.2% and 1.6% as measured on ingesters with 1.3M active series. #4257\r\n* [CHANGE] Dependency: update go-redis from v8.2.3 to v8.9.0. #4236\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max series per query limit is enforced in the querier and applies to unique series received from ingesters and store-gateway (long-term storage). #4179\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier/Ruler: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max chunk bytes limit is enforced in the querier and ruler and limits the size of all aggregated chunks returned from ingesters and storage as bytes for a query. #4216\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: support negative matchers, time-based muting - [upstream release notes](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.22.0). #4237\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added rate-limits to notifiers. Rate limits used by all integrations can be configured using `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit`, while per-integration rate limits can be specified via `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration` parameter. Both shared and per-integration limits can be overwritten using overrides mechanism. These limits are applied on individual (per-tenant) alertmanagers. Rate-limited notifications are failed notifications. It is possible to monitor rate-limited notifications via new `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total` metric. #4135 #4163\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes` limit to control size of configuration files that Cortex users can upload to Alertmanager via API. This limit is configurable per-tenant. #4201\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-templates-count` and `-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes` options to control number and size of templates uploaded to Alertmanager via API. These limits are configurable per-tenant. #4223\r\n* [FEATURE] Added flag `-debug.block-profile-rate` to enable goroutine blocking events profiling. #4217\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: The experimental sharding feature is now considered complete. Detailed information about the configuration options can be found [here for alertmanager](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) and [here for the alertmanager storage](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_storage_config). To use the feature: #3925 #4020 #4021 #4031 #4084 #4110 #4126 #4127 #4141 #4146 #4161 #4162 #4222\r\n  * Ensure that a remote storage backend is configured for Alertmanager to store state using `-alertmanager-storage.backend`, and flags related to the backend. Note that the `local` and `configdb` storage backends are not supported.\r\n  * Ensure that a ring store is configured using `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store`, and set the flags relevant to the chosen store type.\r\n  * Enable the feature using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`.\r\n  * Note the prior addition of a new configuration option `-alertmanager.persist-interval`. This sets the interval between persisting the current alertmanager state (notification log and silences) to object storage. See the [configuration file reference](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) for more information.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Cleanup persisted state objects from remote storage when a tenant configuration is deleted. #4167\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Added the ability to disable Open Census within GCS client (e.g `-gcs.enable-opencensus=false`). #4219\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Etcd: Added username and password to etcd config. #4205\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: introduced new metrics to monitor operation when using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`: #4149\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_completed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: support ingesting exemplars and querying of exemplars.  Enabled by setting new CLI flag `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-exemplars=<n>` or config option `blocks_storage.tsdb.max_exemplars` to positive value. #4124 #4181\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added distributors ring status section in the admin page. #4151\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added zone-awareness support to alertmanager for use when sharding is enabled. When zone-awareness is enabled, alerts will be replicated across availability zones. #4204\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `tenant_ids` tag to tracing spans #4186\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring, query-frontend: Avoid using automatic private IPs (APIPA) when discovering IP address from the interface during the registration of the instance in the ring, or by query-frontend when used with query-scheduler. APIPA still used as last resort with logging indicating usage. #4032\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: introduced new metrics to aid troubleshooting tombstone convergence: #4231\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones_removed_total`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_messages_to_broadcast_dropped_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups` option to control max number of active dispatcher groups in Alertmanager (per tenant, also overrideable). When the limit is reached, Dispatcher produces log message and increases `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_group_limit_reached_total` metric. #4254\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-alerts-count` and `-alertmanager.max-alerts-size-bytes` to control max number of alerts and total size of alerts that a single user can have in Alertmanager's memory. Adding more alerts will fail with a log message and incrementing `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_insert_limited_total` metric (per-user). These limits can be overrided by using per-tenant overrides. Current values are tracked in `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts` and `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts_size_bytes` metrics. #4253\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` and `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-max-duration` support to store-gateway, to wait for ring stability at startup. #4271\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added `rule_group` label to metrics `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_total` and `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total`. #4121\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added new metrics for tracking total number of queries and push requests sent to ingester, as well as failed queries and push requests. Failures are only counted for internal errors, but not user-errors like limits or invalid query.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
