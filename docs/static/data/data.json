The files must be separated with a `---` delimeter on a new line, and each section must begin with a `# FileName=<name>` line to name the new Quadlet ([#27384](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/27384)).\n- Quadlet `.container` files now support a new key, `AppArmor`, for configuring the container's AppArmor profile ([#27095](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27095)).\n- When running the `podman artifact add` command against a `podman machine` VM, if the path being loaded or built is shared into the VM, Podman will load it from the VM's filesystem instead of streaming the data through the REST API, improving performance ([#26321](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/26321)).\n- The `podman update` command now features a new option, `--ulimit`, to update container ulimits ([#26381](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/26381)).\n- The `podman exec` command now features a new option, `--no-session`, which disables tracking of the exec session to improve performance and startup time ([#26588](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/26588)).\n\n### Changes\n- Podman will now automatically attempt to migrate legacy BoltDB databases to SQLite when the system reboots. This is necessary as support for BoltDB will be removed in Podman 6.0 in May. If automatic migration is not possible, a new option, `podman system migrate --migrate-db`, will manually force a migration.\n- The `podman secret create -` command no longer requires that the secret be provided through a pipe, and instead allows typing the secret through the terminal ([#27879](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27879)).\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fixed a bug where containers created by `podman play kube` with a healthcheck using the `initialDelaySeconds` option would run healthchecks before the initial delay had expired ([#27678](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27678)).\n- Fixed a bug where healthchecks would sometimes fail to execute due to systemd rate limits.\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman export` command would emit a `Mount` event instead of an `Export` event.\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command incorrectly handled precedence between environment variables set by both the `envFrom` and `env` fields ([#27287](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27287)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command would panic when parsing Pod YAML missing the `image` field ([#27784](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27784)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume mount` command returned empty paths when volumes were handled by a plugin driver ([#27858](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27858)).\n- Fixed a bug where containers created with `--rootfs` instead of from an image would show that they had a healthcheck in the `starting` state even if no healthcheck was defined ([#27651](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27651)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command's `--pull=newer` option did not function correctly ([#22845](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22845)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `RequiresMountsFor` field in Quadlet `.container` files incorrectly handled bind-mount paths which contained spaces.\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run --detach-keys` option did not accept an empty string (IE, no detach keys) ([#27414](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27414)).\n- Fixed a bug where the remove Podman client's `podman build --secret ... env=VAR` option would incorrectly try to read the environment variable on the server side, instead of from the client ([#27494](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27494)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman artifact push` and `podman artifact pull` commands ignored authentication credentials given by the `--authfile` option ([#27421](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27421)).\n- Fixed a bug where Windows paths were incorrectly handled under some circumstances when using the HyperV machine provider ([#27571](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27571)).\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run --pod-id-file` option was not properly validated, allowing the creation of containers in pods with improper user namespace configuration ([#26848](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/26848)).\n\n### API\n- Added new APIs for interacting with Quadlets, including `GET /libpod/quadlets/{name}/file` (print contents of a Quadlet file), `GET /libpod/quadlets/{name}/exists` (check if the given Quadlet exists), `POST /libpod/quadlets` (install one or more Quadlets), `DELETE /libpod/quadlets` (remove one or more Quadlets), and `DELETE /libpod/quadlets/{name}` (remove a single Quadlet).\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat and Libpod Logs endpoints for Containers did not use nanosecond-level precision for reported timestamps ([#27961](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27691)).\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers incorrectly handled healthcheck commands with arguments containing spaces ([#26519](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/26519)).\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Remove endpoint for Secrets was misnamed as `DELETE /secret/{name}` instead of `DELETE /secrets/{name}` ([#27548](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/27548)).\n\n### Misc\n- Updated Buildah to v1.43.0\n- Updated the containers/storage library v1.62.0\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.39.1\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.67.0\n\n", "created_at": "2026-02-12T15:41:51Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "BFE v1.8.1", "tag_name": "v1.8.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/bfenetworks/bfe/releases/tag/v1.8.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/bfenetworks/bfe", "body": "### Added\r\n- External Web Server Support: Enabled the functionality to call an external web server, enhancing integration capabilities with other services.\r\n- Comprehensive Kubernetes Demo: Introduced a complete Kubernetes demo covering data plane, control plane, and service discovery.

Sizes below 1024 bytes are now shown in `B`, and larger sizes are shown as whole `KiB` (rounded up). This prevents confusion where values like 123.456 KiB were interpreted as 123456 KiB, while the actual size was only 123 KiB. See [#10307](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10307).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): allow buffering request bodies before proxying them to backends. This reduces load on backends when processing requests from slow clients such as IoT devices connected to `vmauth` via slow networks. See [#10309](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10309) and [request body buffering docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#request-body-buffering).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmbackupmanager/): allow completely disabling scheduled backups by using `-disableScheduledBackups` command-line flag. This is useful to run `vmbackupmanager` only for on-demand backups and restores triggered via API. See [#10364](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10364).\r\n* FEATURE: [monitoring](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#monitoring): take into account all the generated log messages at `vm_log_messages_total` metric, including suppressed logs if the `-loggerLevel` command-line flag is set to values other than `INFO`. Add `is_printed` label to the `vm_log_messages_total` metric in order to understand whether the log at the given code `location` was suppressed or not. This simplifies troubleshooting of VictoriaMetrics components when logs aren't available. See [#10304](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10304).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support configuring different `-remoteWrite.queues` per remoteWrite url. This allows setting `-remoteWrite.queues=1` for backends that do not support out-of-order ingestion (e.g. Mimir), while keeping higher queue counts for other backends such as VictoriaMetrics. Previously, this required running multiple vmagent instances with different queue settings. See [#10270](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10270).\r\n* FEATURE: [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules): add new alerting rules `PersistentQueueRunsOutOfSpaceIn12Hours` and `PersistentQueueRunsOutOfSpaceIn4Hours` for `vmagent` persistent queue capacity. These alerts help users to take proactive actions before `vmagent` starts dropping metrics due to insufficient persistent queue space. See [#10193](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10193)\r\n* FEATURE: All VictoriaMetrics components: add build version information to the home page for consistency with other projects. See [#10249](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10249).\r\n* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics components: add flag `fs.disableMincore`, which allows to disable `mincore` syscall. See [#10327](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10327).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): expose topN average memory bytes consumption queries in `/api/v1/status/top_queries`. It can help users to find queries that consume a lot of memory and potentially cause OOM. See [#9330](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9330).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/): add metrics for tracking the migration progress. See [vmctl - monitoring the migration process](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/#monitoring-the-migration-process) and [#10276](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/10276).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): stop backend health checks for URL prefixes defined in `url_map` during configuration reloads. Previously, stale backends kept being health-checked and produced repeated warning logs after reloads.

(#12821, @guoard)\r\n - Cilium `k8sServiceHost` and `k8sServicePort` are now derived from `kube_apiserver_global_endpoint` instead of being auto-detected, so users must ensure this endpoint is correctly set and reachable from all nodes. (#12624, @r3m8)\r\n \r\n## Changes by Kind\r\n\r\n### API Change\r\n\r\n- Removed deprecated `runtime_engine` and `runtime_root` keys from containerd configuration. (#12820, @guoard)\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\n- Crio: add option pull_progress_timeout (#12555, @pedro-peter)\r\n- Fixed `kube_vip_version` variable for managing kube-vip version instead of `kube_vip_image_tag` (#12835, @ThisIsQasim)\r\n- RockyLinux 10 support (experimental) (#12355, @tico88612)\r\n- Support kubernetes v1.34.1 (#12549, @i-yasuda)\r\n- The default Openstack security groups now allow ICMPv6 for general IPv6 functionality. (#12805, @rptaylor)\r\n- Update kube-vip to v1.0.3 (#12815, @LawiK974)\r\n- Upgrade Gateway API to 1.4.0 (#12714, @tico88612)\r\n- Upgrade containerd/nerdctl default version to 2.2.1 (#12825, @guoard)\r\n- `contrib/collection.sh` will create and install the source as collection. (#12660, @bbaassssiiee)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Fix(cilium): prevent installation failure with unprivileged agent (#12628, @r3m8)\r\n- The default namespace for MetalLB resources is now `metallb-system`. (#12860, @kittywaresz)\r\n\r\n### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Action-required\r\n  Adding a control plane node in first place is now explicitly unsupported, the new control plane should be placed at the end of your `kube_control_plane` group (#12636, @clwluvw)\r\n- Add a wait after control plane joining to prevent a kubeadm preflight error when upgrading the control plane configuration at the same time. (#12794, @VannTen)\r\n- Deployments using Calico in vxlan mode without eBPF but with localhost load balancers will now work. (#12598, @rickerc)\r\n- Fix Calico apiserver RBAC permissions for Kubernetes 1.33+ (#12654, @rickerc)\r\n- Fix Cilium loadBalancer.mode rendering in Kubespray values template. (#12701, @intojhanurag)\r\n- Fix RBAC for calico using the etcd datastore (#12828, @LawiK974)\r\n- Fix automatic certs renew with systemd timer (#12876, @VannTen)\r\n- Fix broken upgrade path/control plane node rotation for cluster using calico in etcd datastore mode with separate etcd.\r\n  `etcd_cert_dir_mode` is deleted (always use `0700`) (#12908, @VannTen)\r\n- Fix kubeadm init retry after first failure on cluster creation (#12785, @VannTen)\r\n- Fix(calico): Add missed rbac verb watch for hostendpoints (#12641, @jmeza-xyz)\r\n- Fixed an issue in the config.json.j2 template where the CRI-O registry authentication configuration could render invalid JSON when multiple `crio_registry_auth` entries were defined, resulting in duplicate top-level `auths` keys in the generated config. (#12845, @accuROAMC)\r\n- Removing external etcd member (not stacked with control plane) should now work without erroring out because the node is not in the kubernetes cluster (#12682, @VannTen)\r\n- Update CSI components image version (#12627, @xin053)\r\n- [feat] Setting timezone under SELinux. (#12436, @bbaassssiiee)\r\n- `apiserver_loadbalancer_domain_name` default to `loadbalancer_apiserver.address` if defined (#12872, @VannTen)\r\n\r\n### Other (Cleanup or Flake)\r\n\r\n- Old versions of several components are removed (#12735, @VannTen)\r\n- Remove left-over 'master' tags (#12795, @VannTen)\r\n- Use cilium native CNI chaining for portmap plugin instead of manually writing /etc/cni/net.d/000-cilium-portmap.conflist (#12814, @ThisIsQasim)\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n\r\n- kubernetes 1.34.3\r\n- etcd 3.5.26\r\n- docker 28.3\r\n- containerd 2.2.1\r\n- cri-o 1.34.4\r\n- cni-plugins 1.8.0\r\n- calico 3.30.6\r\n- cilium 1.18.6\r\n- flannel 0.27.3\r\n- kube-ovn 1.12.21\r\n- kube-router 2.1.1\r\n- multus 4.2.2\r\n- kube-vip 1.0.3\r\n- cert-manager 1.15.3\r\n- coredns 1.12.1\r\n- ingress-nginx 1.13.3\r\n- argocd 2.14.5\r\n- helm 3.18.4\r\n- metallb 0.13.9\r\n- registry 2.8.1\r\n- aws-ebs-csi-plugin 0.5.0\r\n- azure-csi-plugin 1.10.0\r\n- cinder-csi-plugin 1.30.0\r\n- gcp-pd-csi-plugin 1.9.2\r\n- local-path-provisioner 0.0.32\r\n- local-volume-provisioner 2.5.0\r\n- node-feature-discovery 0.16.4", "created_at": "2026-01-29T18:15:50Z", "project": "kubespray", "repo": "kubernetes-sigs/kubespray", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.38.0", "tag_name": "v1.38.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.38.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

excited to announce the release of Longhorn v1.11.0. This release marks a major milestone, with the **V2 Data Engine** officially entering the **Technical Preview** stage following significant stability improvements.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this version optimizes the stability of the whole system and introduces critical improvements in resource observability, scheduling, and utilization.\r\n\r\nFor terminology and background on Longhorn releases, see [Releases](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn#releases).\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n>\r\n> ## Hotfix\r\n>\r\n> ### `longhorn-instance-manager` Image\r\n>\r\n> The `longhorn-instance-manager:v1.11.0` image is affected by a [regression issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12573) introduced by the new longhorn-instance-manager Proxy service APIs. The bug causes Proxy connection leaks in the longhorn-instance-manager pods, resulting in increased memory usage. To mitigate this issue, replace `longhornio/longhorn-instance-manager:v1.11.0` with the hotfixed image `longhornio/longhorn-instance-manager:v1.11.0-hotfix-1`.\r\n>\r\n> You can apply the update by following these steps:\r\n>\r\n> 1. **Update the `longhorn-instance-manager` image**\r\n>\r\n>    - Change the longhorn-instance-manager image tag from `v1.11.0` to `v1.11.0-hotfix-1` in the appropriate file:\r\n>        - For Helm: Update `values.yaml`\r\n>        - For manifests: Update the deployment manifest directly.\r\n>\r\n> 2. **Proceed with the installation or upgrade**\r\n>\r\n>    - Apply the changes using your standard Helm install/upgrade command or reapply the updated manifest.\r\n>\r\n> ### `longhorn-manager` Image\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> The `longhorn-manager:v1.11.0` image is affected by a [regression issue](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12578) introduced by the new `Kubernetes Node` validator. The bug blocks setting Kubernetes node CNI labels because it waits for the Longhorn webhook server to be running, while the Longhorn webhook server waits for CNI network to be ready. To mitigate this issue, replace `longhornio/longhorn-manager:v1.11.0` with the hotfixed image `longhornio/longhorn-manager:v1.11.0-hotfix-1`.\r\n>\r\n> You can apply the update by following these steps:\r\n> \r\n> 1. **Disable the upgrade version check**\r\n>   - Helm users: Set `upgradeVersionCheck` to `false` in the `values.yaml` file.\r\n>   - Manifest users: Remove the `--upgrade-version-check` flag from the deployment manifest.\r\n>\r\n> 2. **Update the `longhorn-manager` image**\r\n>   - Change the `longhorn-manager` image tag from `v1.11.0` to `v1.11.0-hotfix-1` in the appropriate file:\r\n>     - For Helm: Update `values.yaml`.\r\n>     - For manifests: Update the deployment manifest directly.\r\n>\r\n>3. **Proceed with the installation or upgrade**\r\n>   - Apply the changes using your standard Helm install/upgrade command or reapply the updated manifest.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation\r\n\r\n### V2 Backing Image Deprecation\r\n\r\nThe Backing Image feature for the V2 Data Engine is now deprecated in v1.11.0 and is scheduled for removal in v1.12.0.\r\n\r\nUsers using V2 volumes for virtual machines are encouraged to adopt the [Containerized Data Importer (CDI)](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/containerized_data_importer/) for volume population instead.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #12237](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12237)\r\n\r\n## Primary Highlights\r\n\r\n### V2 Data Engine\r\n\r\n#### Now in Technical Preview Stage\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce that the V2 Data Engine has officially graduated to the **Technical Preview** stage. This indicates increased stability and feature maturity as we move toward General Availability.\r\n\r\n> **Limitation:** While the engine is in Technical Preview, live upgrade is not supported yet. V2 volumes must be detached (offline) before engine upgrade.\r\n\r\n#### Support for `ublk` Frontend\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports configuring UBLK performance parameters globally, per volume, or via StorageClass to improve I/O performance.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #11039](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11039)\r\n\r\n### V1 Data Engine\r\n\r\n#### Faster Replica Rebuilding from Multiple Sources\r\n\r\nThe V1 Data Engine now supports parallel rebuilding. When a replica needs to be rebuilt, the engine can now stream data from multiple healthy replicas simultaneously rather than a single source. This significantly reduces the time required to restore redundancy for volumes containing tons of scattered data chunks.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #11331](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11331)\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n#### Balance-Aware Algorithm Disk Selection For Replica Scheduling\r\n\r\nLonghorn improves the disk selection for the replica scheduling by introducing an intelligent `balance-aware` scheduling algorithm, reducing uneven storage usage across nodes and disks.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #10512](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10512)\r\n\r\n#### Node Disk Health Monitoring\r\n\r\nLonghorn now actively monitors the physical health of the underlying disks used for storage by using S.M.A.R.T. data. This allows administrators to identify issues and raise alerts when abnormal SMART metrics are detected, helping prevent failed volumes.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #12016](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12016)\r\n\r\n#### Share Manager Networking\r\n\r\nUsers can now configure an extra network interface for the Share Manager to support complex network segmentation requirements.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #10269](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10269)\r\n\r\n#### ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP) Support\r\n  \r\nFull support for the Kubernetes `ReadWriteOncePod` access mode has been added.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #9727](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9727)\r\n\r\n#### StorageClass `allowedTopologies` Support\r\n\r\nAdministrators can now use the `allowedTopologies` field in Longhorn StorageClasses to restrict volume provisioning to specific zones, regions, or nodes within the cluster.\r\n\r\n[GitHub Issue #12261](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12261)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before installing Longhorn v1.11.0.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.11.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.10.x to v1.11.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.11.0/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Post-Release Known Issues\r\n\r\nFor information about issues identified after this release, see [Release-Known-Issues](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Release-Known-Issues).\r\n\r\n## Resolved Issues in this release\r\n\r\n### Highlight\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Add support for ReadWriteOncePod access mode [9727](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9727) - @derekbit @shikanime @chriscchien @Copilot\r\n- [FEATURE] Scale replica rebuilding speed from multiple healthy replicas [11331](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11331) - @derekbit @shuo-wu @roger-ryao @Copilot\r\n- [FEATURE] Support StorageClass allowedTopologies for Longhorn volumes [12261](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12261) - @yangchiu @derekbit @hookak @Copilot\r\n- [FEATURE] Support extra network interface (not only storage network) on the share manager pod [10269](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10269) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n- [FEATURE] Monitor Node Disk Health [12016](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12016) - @c3y1huang @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Replica Auto Balance Across Nodes based on Node Disk Space Consumption [10512](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10512) - @davidcheng0922 @chriscchien\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Guess Linux distro from the package manager [12153](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12153) - @yangchiu @derekbit @NamrathShetty @Copilot\r\n- [FEATURE] Provide a helm chart setting to define the managerUrl [10583](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10583) - @lexfrei @yangchiu\r\n- [FEATURE] Add metric for last backup of a volume [6049](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/6049) - @c3y1huang @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Real-time volume performance monitoring [368](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/368) - @derekbit @hookak\r\n- [UI][FEATURE] Monitor Node Disk Health [12263](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12263) - @houhoucoop @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] custom annotation/label of UI's k8s service on value.yaml of helm chart [11754](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11754) - @yangchiu @lucasl0st\r\n- [FEATURE] Make `longhornctl` load `ublk_drv` module when kernel version is 6 or newer [11803](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11803) - @chriscchien @bachmanity1\r\n- [BUG] Inherit namespace for longhorn-share-manager in FastFailover mode [12244](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12244) - @yangchiu @semenas\r\n- [FEATURE] Enable CSI pod anti-affinity preset update [12100](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12100) - @yangchiu @yulken\r\n- [FEATURE] [Dependency] aws-sdk-go v1.55.7 is EOL as of 2025-07-31 \u2014 plan to migrate to v2?

These issues are due to the AD FS Relying Party Trust not being able to pick up a signature verification certificate from the metadata. For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655). These issues can be corrected by either of two methods:\r\n>\r\n> * Updating the Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...)\r\n> * Directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate).\r\n\r\nRancher v2.13.2 is the latest patch release of Rancher. This is a Community version release that introduces maintenance updates and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nFor more information on new features in the general minor release, see the [v2.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.13.0).\r\n\r\n## Security Fixes for Rancher Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThis release addresses the following Rancher security issue:\r\n\r\n- Rancher now provides new versions of the Rancher Backup chart which prevent the leak of secret S3 credentials via the Rancher Backup pod log. For more information, refer to [CVE-2025-62879](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-wj3p-5h3x-c74q).\r\n- Rancher now removes the ability to fetch CA certificates stored in Rancher\u2019s setting `cacerts` when using the `login` command. For more information, refer to [CVE-2025-67601](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-mc24-7m59-4q5p).\r\n\r\nFor additional details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/{rn-component-version}/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) or in Rancher's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n## Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the selection of pods in the Rancher UI (**Workloads \\> Pods**) would reset when the status of a pod changed. See [#16094](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/16094).\r\n\r\n- Added additional improvements to reduce the amount of failed network requests when fetching resources shown in lists in the Rancher UI by reducing the length of the URL used in the request. This failure was more likely to happen when viewing resources in the local cluster as an administrator. See [#16216](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/16216).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Chart name change for Rancher Prime. The chart name change introduced in Rancher Prime v2.13.1 has been reverted. The chart name `rancher` should be used for all installations and upgrades. As an example, the installation command is now `helm install rancher rancher-prime/rancher`.\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher now requires the cluster it runs on to have the [Kubernetes API Aggregation Layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) enabled. This is because Rancher extends Kubernetes with additional APIs by registering its own extension API server. Please note that all versions of Kubernetes supported in this Rancher versions K8s distributions (RKE2/K3s) will have the aggregation layer configured and enabled by default. Refer to the [Extension API Server documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/api/extension-apiserver#aggregation-layer-is-required) and [#50400](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/50400) for more information.\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE/RKE1) has reached end of life as of **July 31, 2025**. Rancher versions 2.12.0 and later no longer support provisioning or managing downstream RKE1 clusters. We recommend replatforming RKE1 clusters to RKE2 to ensure continued support and security updates. Learn more about the transition [here](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021518).\r\n>\r\n> Rancher now has a pre-upgrade validation check for RKE1 resources which fails and lists the RKE1 resources if present. Refer to the [RKE1 Resource Validation and Upgrade Requirements documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker/upgrade-docker-installed-rancher#rke1-resource-validation-and-upgrade-requirements-in-rancher-v212) and [#50286](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/50286) for more information.\r\n\r\n> **Important:** It is crucial that you review the available disk space on your nodes and plan accordingly before upgrading to Rancher v2.12.0 and later to avoid potential disk pressure and pod eviction issues. For additional information refer to the [UI Server Side Pagination - Disk Space documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/ui-server-side-pagination#disk-space).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher now has an enablement option called [`AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log#viewing-api-audit-logs:~:text=Description-,AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED,-false%20%2D%20Disables%20the) for API Audit Logs for a Rancher installation. In Rancher versions 2.11.x and earlier, only the `AUDIT_LEVEL` could be set and the default log level (`0`) would disable the audit log. In Rancher versions 2.12.x and later, the default log level (`0`) now only contains the log request and response metadata, and can be set when configuring `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`. If installing or upgrading via Helm you can enable the API Audit Logs and specify the log level by applying the following setting to your Helm command: `--set auditLog.enabled=true --set auditLog.level=0`. See the [Enabling the API Audit Log to Record System Events](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log) documentation and [#48941](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48941).\r\n\r\n## Changes in Image Artifacts\r\n\r\nImage artifact digests are renamed in Rancher v2.12.0, v2.11.4 and v2.10.8. Up until this change, separate image digests files for each operating system and architecture have been maintained for compatibility reasons. With this change, only one file for each operating system is to be provided:\r\n\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-linux-amd64.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-linux-arm64.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-linux.txt`.\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2019.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2022.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-windows.txt`.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n\r\n- **Helm version requirements:**\r\n\r\n  - To manage Rancher 2.12.x and later, you must upgrade your Helm client to version 3.18 or newer.\r\n  - This change is required to reflect the addition of Kubernetes 1.33 support with this release.\r\n  - Currently, the official [Helm Version Support Policy](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/version_skew/) dictates that only Helm 3.18 supports the proper Kubernetes version range for Rancher 2.12.\r\n\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it\u2019s incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you\u2019ll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.13.2\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.13.2](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.13.2)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.34.3 (Default)\r\n- v1.33.7\r\n- v1.32.11\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.13.0:**\r\n  - Official support for Kubernetes v1.31 and older versions has been removed. You can no longer provision new RKE2 or K3s clusters using the Kubernetes versions that fall outside of the supported range (v1.32 - v1.34). See [#51253](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51253).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.13.0:**\r\n  - The Rancher UI for provisioning hosted Kubernetes clusters (AKS, EKS, and GKE) has been updated to align with the new Cluster Provisioning v2 (kev2) framework. This change replaces the reliance on the older kontainerdriver (kev1) resources to determine which hosted providers are available for display. The UI now uses a new setting to manage the visibility of these providers, ensuring consistency and future compatibility. See [#15391](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15391).\r\n  - Rancher\u2019s session inactivity logic has been moved from the UI to the backend. A new session TTL setting `auth-user-session-idle-ttl-minutes` was introduced, and it sets the maximum time a user is allowed to be idle within a browser session before the session expires. To enable the idle timeout feature, you must supply `auth-user-session-idle-ttl-minutes` and set it to a value lower than the existing absolute session limit, `auth-user-session-ttl-minutes`. This new backend-driven mechanism, along with its associated TTL setting, replaces the previous session timeout configuration in the UI under **Global Settings** \\> **Performance**. See [#12552](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12552).\r\n\r\n# Future Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n## Retention Policy for Rancher App Charts\r\n\r\nTo improve repository performance, Rancher is introducing a lifecycle management policy for charts available in the Apps feature of Rancher,specifically in the \"Rancher\" repository.\r\n\r\n- **The Policy:** Rancher will transition from a cumulative model (retaining all historical versions forever) to a retention model that preserves chart versions for the **seven (7) most recent Rancher minor releases** (approximately a 2.5-year window).\r\n- **Timeline - Rancher v2.13 & v2.14:** Legacy chart versions (older than the 7-version window) remain available.\r\n- **Rancher v2.15:** This will be the first version to enforce the policy. Versions falling outside the 7-version window and older than two years will no longer be available.\r\n\r\n**Impact:** This change is non-destructive for existing Rancher installations. Historical versions will remain accessible but will not be available in newer release branches once they age out of the 7-version window. You are advised to upgrade your applications before upgrading to Rancher v2.15. Uninstallation after v2.15, and replacement with an updated version, will still be possible.\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.12.2:**\r\n  - The [SUSE Customer Center (SCC)](https://scc.suse.com/home) system view has a known issue being investigated regarding duplicate Rancher Manager registrations. See [rancher/scc-operator#38](https://github.com/rancher/scc-operator/issues/38).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n- **Rancher v2.13.0:**\r\n  - Provisioning or importing an Amazon EKS downstream cluster fails when the Rancher Server is running in an IPv6-only or dual-stack environment. See [#52154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52154).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR] 000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`. See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management \\> Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve **Active** status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.12.1:**\r\n  - When a standard user with the Cluster Owner role attempts to edit an Azure or AKS cluster, the Machine Pools section shows an error `Cannot read properties of undefined\u2026\u200b`. As a workaround, standard users must manually add their cloud credentials to create, edit, and manage Azure or AKS clusters. See [#15241](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15241).\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - After deleting a Namespace or Project in the Rancher UI, the Namespace or Project remains visible. As a workaround, refresh the page. See [#12220](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12220).\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2:**\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider\r\n    support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to\r\n      add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not\r\n      populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as\r\n      the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See\r\n      [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID. See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"management.cattle.io\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Virtualization Management (Harvester)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.13.1:**\r\n  - When upgrading to Rancher v2.13.1 or higher while using Harvester v1.6.1, users may encounter an issue with their Load Balancers in downstream clusters using the Harvester Cloud Provider, and must perform the following [workaround](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/9767#issuecomment-3669505973) to instruct Calico to not use any of the IP/interface managed by `kube-vip`. See [#9767](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/9767).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you\u2019re using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won\u2019t be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the\r\n  server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Rancher v2.13.0:**\r\n  - When performing a rollback from Rancher v2.13.0 to v2.12.3 using the backup and restore operator (BRO), the restore does not complete successfully. See [#844](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/issues/844). To work around this issue, you must scale down your Rancher deployment and uninstall the Webhook chart before performing the restore. For details, refer to this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.scc.suse.com/s/kb/Rolling-back-from-Rancher-v2-13-0-to-v2-12-3?language=en_US).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve **Active** status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n", "created_at": "2026-01-29T01:42:06Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Kibana 9.3.0", "tag_name": "v9.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/kibana/releases/tag/v9.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/kibana", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/kibana\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/docs/release-notes/kibana#kibana-9.3.0-release-notes\n", "created_at": "2026-01-28T22:36:46Z", "project": "Kibana", "repo": "elastic/kibana", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Elasticsearch 9.3.0", "tag_name": "v9.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/releases/tag/v9.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/docs/release-notes/elasticsearch#elasticsearch-9.3.0-release-notes\n", "created_at": "2026-01-28T18:57:57Z", "project": "Elasticsearch", "repo": "elastic/elasticsearch", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.43.0", "tag_name": "0.43.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.43.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco", "body": "[![LIBS](https://img.shields.io/badge/LIBS-0.23.1-yellow)](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/releases/tag/0.23.1)\n[![DRIVER](https://img.shields.io/badge/DRIVER-9.1.0+driver-yellow)](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/releases/tag/9.1.0+driver)\n\n| Packages | Download                                                                                                                                               |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| rpm-x86_64      | [![rpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/rpm/falco-0.43.0-x86_64.rpm)        |\n| deb-x86_64      | [![deb](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/deb/stable/falco-0.43.0-x86_64.deb) |\n| tgz-x86_64      | [![tgz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/bin/x86_64/falco-0.43.0-x86_64.tar.gz) |\n| tgz-static-x86_64      | [![tgz-static](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/bin/x86_64/falco-0.43.0-static-x86_64.tar.gz) |\n| rpm-aarch64      | [![rpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/rpm/falco-0.43.0-aarch64.rpm)        |\n| deb-aarch64      | [![deb](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/deb/stable/falco-0.43.0-aarch64.deb) |\n| tgz-aarch64      | [![tgz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Falco-0.43.0-%2300aec7?style=flat-square)](https://download.falco.org/packages/bin/aarch64/falco-0.43.0-aarch64.tar.gz) |\n\n| Images                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `docker pull docker.io/falcosecurity/falco:0.43.0`                      |\n| `docker pull public.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco:0.43.0`                 |\n| `docker pull docker.io/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader:0.43.0`        |\n| `docker pull docker.io/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader:0.43.0-buster` |\n| `docker pull docker.io/falcosecurity/falco:0.43.0-debian`               |\n\n## v0.43.0\n\nReleased on 2026-01-28\n\n### Breaking Changes :warning:\n\n* fix(userspace)!: show source config path only in debug builds [[#3787](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/3787)] - [@leogr](https://github.com/leogr)\n\n\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n* chore: [NOTICE] The GPG key used to sign DEB/RPM packages has been rotated, and all existing packages have been re-signed.

"https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## \ud83d\udea8 Breaking or Notable Changes\r\n\r\n#### Secure Pod Defaults  (#16042, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\nWe've introduce `secure-pod-defaults` in an earlier release and included a new setting `AllowRootBounded` in `v1.20` that offers a better security posture for your workloads but balances the compatibility with images that require/expect you to run as root. \r\n\r\nFor `1.21` release the `secure-pod-defaults` default will remain `disabled` but in a future release (most likely `v1.22`) we will switch this default to `AllowRootBounded`. \r\n\r\n_If you're unsure whether your workloads will support this new setting you should explicitly set this option to `disabled` prior to upgrading to `v1.22`._\r\n\r\nFor more information see the [documentation](https://knative.dev/development/serving/configuration/secure-pod-defaults/) and reach out if you foresee issues in your testing.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n- You can now set the new feature `pod-is-always-schedulable` to `true` in the config-deployment ConfigMap. As a result, Knative will not mark revisions as Unschedulable when a Pod is not scheduled. This makes sense if you want to omit this transient state in clusters that have cluster-autoscaling set up, and you can guarantee that all Pods will be eventually scheduled. (#16146, @SaschaSchwarze0)\r\n- Activator probe timeout and frequency are now configurable via PROBE_TIMEOUT and PROBE_FREQUENCY environment variables. (#16250, @bindrad)\r\n- Add  `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` support for user and sidecar container probes (#16255, @flomedja)\r\n- Added support for OpenTelemetry W3C Trace Context (traceparent header) in request logging, while maintaining backward compatibility with Zipkin B3 format. (#16168, @SomilJain0112)\r\n- Allow activator to be out of the request path when system-internal-tls is enabled (#16183, @linkvt)\r\n- Allow adjusting Revision min/max scale annotations (#16186, @dprotaso)\r\n- Allow unreachable revisions with initialScale > 1 to scale to 0 (#16327, @aviralgarg05)\r\n- Include two new activator metrics (`kn.activator.stats.conn.reachable`, `kn.activator.stats.conn.errors`) that reflect the stats reporter connection status (#16318, @prashanthjos)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc1eBug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Preserve deployment and template annotations and labels during reconcile (#16199, @linkvt)\r\n- Fall back to HTTP1 on failed HTTP2 health probes (e.g. on connection error or non-readiness) (#16205, @linkvt)\r\n- Fix a rare data race in revision backend manager creating revision watchers during shutdown (#16225, @linkvt)\r\n- Fix flaky HTTPS e2e tests by waiting for HTTPS endpoint to be Ready. (#16230, @linkvt)\r\n- Fix metric names to match the original design document `kn.queueproxy.app.duration` becomes `kn.serving.invocation.duration` and `kn.queueproxy.depth` becomes `kn.serving.queue.depth` (#16290, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix request log output corruption when using invalid log templates (#16242, @linkvt)\r\n- Fixed duplicate ACME challenge paths when Services with traffic tags use HTTP-01 challenges for TLS certificates. (#16259, @linkvt)\r\n- Services can no longer route traffic to revisions belonging to different services; attempting to do so will result in Ready=False with reason RevisionNotOwned. (#16294, @linkvt)\r\n- Services with invalid networking.knative.dev/* annotations on the revision template now fail immediately with a clear error instead of getting stuck. (#16296, @linkvt)\r\n- Switch to async metric instrumentation to avoid unbounded memory growth (#16300, @dprotaso)\r\n- fix sub-second precision metric reporting (#16358, @dprotaso)\r\n\r\n## New

ID in frontend and distributor [#5786](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/5786) (@carles-grafana)\r\n* [CHANGE] Remove vParquet2 encoding [#6071](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6071) (@mdisibio)\r\n  **BREAKING CHANGE** In the last release vParquet2 was deprecated and blocked from writes. Now, it's\r\n  removed entirely. It will no longer be recognized as a valid encoding and cannot read any remaining vParquet2 blocks. Installations\r\n  running with historical defaults should not require any changes as the default has been migrated for several releases. Installations\r\n  with storage settings pinned to vParquet2 must run a previous release configured for vParquet3 or higher until all existing vParquet2 blocks\r\n  have expired and been deleted from the backend, or else it will encounter read errors after upgrading to this release.\r\n* [CHANGE] **BREAKING CHANGE** Added `scope` and `query` params while rewriting integration tests to the Tempo HTTP client `SearchTagsV2WithRange` function. [#6088](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/6088) (@joe-elliott)\r\n* [CHANGE] **BREAKING CHANGE** TempoDB schemas vParquet3 and v2 are deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.

[#15021](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15021)\r\n\r\n * CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache can now be configured via `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issues: [#2338](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2338), [#15160](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15160)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugins\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Restored exchange federation compatibility in mixed 4.2.x/4.1.x multi-node clusters.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15252](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15252)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Federation links and their connections are now stopped in parallel.\r\n\r\n   This significantly improves shutdown time for nodes with many (into thousands) federation links.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15271](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15271)\r\n\r\n * Federation links no longer restart during plugin or node shutdown.\r\n\r\n   For nodes with hundreds or thousands of federation links, link recovery could\r\n   significantly delay node shutdown.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15258](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15258)\r\n\r\n * Federation links use AMQP 0-9-1 connections to remote nodes (clusters).\r\n\r\n   Previously the timeout used when those connections are closed was fixed to 10 seconds.\r\n   Now it is configurable via `rabbitmq.conf` in milliseconds:\r\n\r\n   ```ini\r\n   # 3 seconds for exchange federation\r\n   federation.exchanges.connection_close_timeout = 3000\r\n\r\n   # 3 seconds for queue federation\r\n   federation.queues.connection_close_timeout = 3000\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The maximum supported value is 5 seconds (5000 ms).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15268](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15268)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmq-streams grow` and `rabbitmq-streams shrink` are new commands that mirror existing\r\n   `rabbitmq-queues grow` and `rabbitmq-queues shrink` functionality for streams.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15189](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15189)\r\n\r\n\r\n### MQTT Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * A new configuration option, `mqtt.disconnect_on_unauthorized`, controls whether\r\n   MQTT connections are closed upon authorization failures (for example, an attempt to\r\n   consume from a topic the client has no permission for).\r\n\r\n   When set to `false`, the connection remains open and an appropriate protocol-level\r\n   response is sent to the client instead.\r\n\r\n   The default value is `true`, same as RabbitMQ MQTT implementation's historic behavior.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15201](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15201)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * OAuth 2: `preferred_auth_mechanism` and `strict_auth_mechanism` are no longer validated\r\n   when not used (configured).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15148](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15148)\r\n\r\n\r\n### etcd Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When credentials were provided, the password was double-encrypted, resulting in\r\n   etcd authentication failures.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15191](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/15191)\r\n\r\n\r\n### HTTP Auth Backend Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The `customize_hostname_check` TLS option was unintentionally ignored.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15184](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\n * `khepri` was upgraded to [`0.17.4`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri/releases/tag/v0.17.4)\r\n * `khepri_mnesia_migration` was upgraded to

Container images are now exported using a compressed OCI image layout.\r\n* packaging: UBI container images are now built on the UBI 10 minimal image.\r\n* secrets/azure: Update plugin to v0.25.1+ent. Improves retry handling during Azure application and service principal creation to reduce transient failures.\r\n* storage: Upgrade aerospike client library to v8.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS:\r\n\r\n* core: check rotation manager queue every 5 seconds instead of 10 seconds to improve responsiveness\r\n* go: update to golang/x/crypto to v0.45.0 to resolve GHSA-f6x5-jh6r-wrfv, GHSA-j5w8-q4qc-rx2x, GO-2025-4134 and GO-2025-4135.\r\n* rotation: Ensure rotations for shared paths only execute on the Primary cluster's active node. Ensure rotations for local paths execute on the cluster-local active node.\r\n* sdk/rotation: Prevent rotation attempts on read-only storage.\r\n* secrets-sync (enterprise): Added support for a boolean force_delete flag (default: false).

The v1beta4 patch will need to move `extraArgs` from a map to a list, for examples see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example of kind config with kubeadm config patch targeting both v1beta3 and v1beta4, consider this simple kind config that sets verbosity of the apiserver logs:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: Cluster\r\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\r\nkubeadmConfigPatches:\r\n# patch for v1beta3 (1.23 ...)\r\n- |\r\n  kind: ClusterConfiguration\r\n  apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3\r\n  apiServer:\r\n    extraArgs:\r\n      \"v\": \"4\"\r\n# patch for v1beta4 (future)\r\n- |\r\n  kind: ClusterConfiguration\r\n  apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4\r\n  apiServer:\r\n    extraArgs:\r\n      - name: \"v\"\r\n        value: \"4\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you only need to target a particular release, you can use one version.\r\n\r\nIf you only need to target fields that did not change between kubeadm beta versions, you can use a versionless patch, which may be more convenient, but we cannot guarantee there will be no future kubeadm config breaking changes.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- Assorted unspecified dependency updates\r\n\r\nImages pre-built for this release:\r\n- v1.35.0: `kindest/node:v1.35.0@sha256:452d707d4862f52530247495d180205e029056831160e22870e37e3f6c1ac31f`\r\n- v1.34.3: `kindest/node:v1.34.3@sha256:08497ee19eace7b4b5348db5c6a1591d7752b164530a36f855cb0f2bdcbadd48`\r\n- v1.33.7: `kindest/node:v1.33.7@sha256:d26ef333bdb2cbe9862a0f7c3803ecc7b4303d8cea8e814b481b09949d353040`\r\n- v1.32.11: `kindest/node:v1.32.11@sha256:5fc52d52a7b9574015299724bd68f183702956aa4a2116ae75a63cb574b35af8`\r\n- v1.31.14: `kindest/node:v1.31.14@sha256:6f86cf509dbb42767b6e79debc3f2c32e4ee01386f0489b3b2be24b0a55aac2b`\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: You _must_ use the `@sha256` digest to guarantee an image built for this release, until such a time as we switch to a different tagging scheme.

OpenEBS 4.4.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\n## Release Summary\r\nOpenEBS version 4.4 introduces several functional fixes and new features focused on improving Data Security, User Experience, High availability (HA), replica rebuilds, and overall stability. The key highlights are LocalPV LVM snapshot restores . In addition, the release includes various usability and functional fixes for mayastor,  ZFS, LocalPV LVM and LocalPV Hostpath provisioners, along with documentation enhancements to help users and new contributors get started quickly.\r\n\r\n## Replicated Storage (Mayastor)\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- DiskPool Expansion\r\nIt's now possible to expand a DiskPool's capacity by expanding the underlying storage device.\r\n> _**NOTE**_: As a precondition you must create the DiskPool with sufficient metadata to accommodate/support future growth, please read more about this [here](https://openebs.io/docs/main/user-guides/replicated-storage-user-guide/replicated-pv-mayastor/advanced-operations/diskpool-expansion).\r\n- Configurable ClusterSize\r\nYou can now configure the cluster size when creating a pool - larger cluster sizes may be beneficial when using very large storage devices.\r\n>_**NOTE**_: As an initial limitation volumes may not be placed across pools with different cluster sizes\r\n- Pool Cordon\r\nExtend cordoning functionality to pools. This can be used to prevent new replicas from being created on a pool, and also as a way of migrating a volume replica out of it via scale-up/scale-down operations. \r\n- Orphaned Retain Snapshot Delete\r\nSimilar to volumes, when with snapshots retain move are deleted, the underlying storage is kept by the provisioner and must be deleted with provisioner specific commands.\r\nWe've added a plugin sub-command to delete these orphaned snapshots safely.\r\n- Node Spread\r\nNode spread topology may now be used\r\n- Affinity Group ScaleDown\r\nAffinity group volumes may now be scaled down to 1 replica, provided the anti-affinity across nodes is not violated.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n\r\n- Update replica health as an atomic etcd transaction\r\n- Exit io-engine with error if the gRPC port is busy\r\n- Set PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER for io-engine to resolve potential deadlock\r\n- Don't let 1 bad nexus lockup the entire nexus subsystem\r\n- Clean up uuid from DISKS output uri\r\n- Honor stsAffinity on backup restores via external tools\r\n- Validate K8s secret in diskpool operator ahead of pool creation request\r\n- Allow pool creation with zfs volume paths\r\n- Added support for kubeconfig context switching (kubectl-mayastor plugin)\r\n- Fixed creating pools on very-slow/very-large storage devices\r\n- Use udev kernel monitor\r\n- Fixed race condition where udev events were lost leading to connecting nvme devices\r\n- Fixed HA enablement on the latest rhel and derivatives\r\n- Fixed open permissions on call-home encryption dir\r\n- Configurable ports of services with hostNetwork\r\n- Add support for 1GiB hugepages\r\n- etcd dependency updated to `12.0.14`\r\n- Use normalized etcdUrl in default etcd-probe init containers \r\n- Use correct grpc port in metrics exporter\r\n- Fix volume mkfs stuck on very large pools/volumes\r\n- Fix agent-core panic when scheduling replicas\r\n- Add default priority class to the daemon sets\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [Mayastor v2.10.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor/releases/tag/v2.10.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n   - The Mayastor IO engine fully utilizes allocated CPU cores regardless of I/O load, running a poller at full speed.\r\n   - A Mayastor DiskPool is limited to a single block device and cannot span multiple block devices.\r\n   - The new at-rest encryption feature does not support rotating Data Encryption Keys(DEK).\r\n   - Volume rebuilds are only performed on published volumes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- **IO-Engine Pod Restarts**  \r\n   - Under heavy I/O and during constant scaling up/down of volume replicas, the io-engine pod may restart occasionally.\r\n- **fsfreeze Operation Failure**  \r\n   - If a pod-based workload is scheduled on a node that reboots and the pod lacks a controller (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet),  the volume unpublish operation might not be triggered. \r\n   - This leads the control plane to assume the volume is still published, causing the fsfreeze operation to fail during snapshot creation.\r\n        - **Workaround** Recreate or reinstate the pod to ensure proper volume mounting.\r\n- **Diskpool's backing device failure**\r\n   - If the backend device that hosts a diskpool runs into a fault, or gets removed e.g cloud disk removal, the status of diskpool and hosted replicas isn't clearly updated to reflect the problem. \r\n   - As a result the resultant failures aren't gracefully handled and volume might remain Degraded for an extended period of time.\r\n- **Extremely large pool undergoing dirty shutdown**\r\n   - In case of a dirty shutdown of io-engine node hosting an extremely large pool e.g 10TiB or 20TiB.\r\n   - The recovery of pool takes a while after the node comes online.\r\n\r\n## LocalPV ZFS\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n- Update Go runtime to 1.24.\r\n  Bumps up go runtime and all dependents to their latest available releases \r\n- Allow users to configure CPU and memory requests/limits for all zfs-node and zfs-controller containers via values.yaml, improving resource management and deployment flexibility\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n- Removes encryption parameter handling from `buildCloneCreateArgs()` since clones automatically inherit encryption from the parent snapshot and the property cannot be set (it's read-only) \r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration and Maintenance\r\n- Staging CI \r\n   Introduction of the staging CI, which enables creating a staging build for e2e testing before releasing, the artifacts are then copied over to production build hosts.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [ZFS v2.9.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/releases/tag/v2.9.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## LocalPV LVM\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Snapshot restore\r\n   LocalPV-LVM snapshot had limited capabilities. Now we support restoring a snapshot to volume \r\n- ThinPool space reclamation\r\n   LocalPV-LVM will cleanup the thinpool LV after deleting the last thin volume of the thinpool \r\n- Scheduler fixes and enhancements\r\n    Record thinpool statistics in lvmnode CR. Fail fast CreateVolume request if thick PVC size cannot be accommodated by any VG.\r\n    Considers thinpool free space while scheduling thin pvc in SpaceWeighted algorithm \r\n- Runtime improvements\r\n   Updates Go runtime, k8s modules, golint packages etc by @jochenseeber in https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/416\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration and Maintenance\r\n-  Staging CI\r\n    Introduction of the staging CI, which enables creating a staging build for e2e testing before releasing, the artifacts are then copied over to production build hosts.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [LVM v1.8.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/releases/tag/v1.8.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- There's no unmap/reclaim for thin pool capacity.\r\n  It is not tracked in the `lvmnode`, which may lead to unexpected behaviour when scheduling volumes.  \r\n  Read more about this [here](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/issues/382)\r\n\r\n## LocalPV Hostpath\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [Hostpath v4.4.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner/releases/tag/v4.4.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## LocalPV RawFile\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- VolumeSnapshots based on the rawfile image\r\n- Volume Restore from snapshot\r\n- Volume Clone\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\nMake sure you follow the [install guide](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv/blob/v0.11.0/docs/install-guide.md#upgrade) when upgrading.  \r\nRefer to the [Rawfile v0.12.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv/releases/tag/v0.12.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- **Controller Pod Restart on Single Node Setup**  \r\n   After upgrading, single node setups may face issues where the ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv controller pod does not enter the Running state due to changes in the controller manifest (now a Deployment) and missing affinity rules.\r\n \r\n  _Workaround:_ Delete the old controller pod to allow the new pod to be scheduled correctly. This does not happen if upgrading from the previous release of ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n   - Kubernetes Requirement: Kubernetes 1.23 or higher is recommended.\r\n   - Engine Compatibility: Upgrades to OpenEBS 4.4.0 are supported only for the following engines:\r\n     - Local PV Hostpath\r\n     - Local PV LVM\r\n     - Local PV ZFS\r\n     - Mayastor (from earlier editions, 3.10.x or below)\r\n     - Local PV Rawfile\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-11-21T14:06:09Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage",

users can now perform a global fuzzy search on the key and value of configuration items, making it easier to locate where the configuration is being used across applications, environments, clusters, and namespaces. See [Configuration queries (administrator privileges)](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_17-configuration-queries-administrator-privileges).\r\n\r\n### Observer Mode for Application AccessKey \r\nBefore officially enabling application keys, you can configure Application AccessKeys in observation mode to only log without intercepting configuration retrieval.\r\n\r\n### Limitation on the Number of Namespaces and Configuration Items\r\nUsers can now limit the number of namespaces and also the number of configuration items in a single namespace. See [Parameter settings for limiting the number of namespaces in the appld+cluster dimension](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_64-parameter-settings-for-limiting-the-number-of-namespaces-in-the-appldcluster-dimension) and [Limitation on the number of configuration items in a single namespace](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_65-limitation-on-the-number-of-configuration-items-in-a-single-namespace).\r\n\r\n### Cluster-Level Permission Control Support\r\nUsers can now configure editing and publishing permissions for namespaces based on cluster granularity.
