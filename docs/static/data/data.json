Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\nUsers upgrading from 3.12.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.13.x on Erlang 26\r\n(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult\r\nthe [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) and [v3.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.13.0) first.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.13.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Broker\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * A rolling upgrade from `3.12.14` to `3.13.x` could run into an exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11380](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11380)\r\n\r\n * When an existing virtual host was re-imported from a definitions file,\r\n   its default queue type (DQT) was cleared (reset) if that field was missing in the imported\r\n   definitions.\r\n\r\n   Now the existing DQT is preserved.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11457](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11457)\r\n\r\n * When a queue was declared without an explicitly provided `x-queue-type` but a default\r\n   queue type (DQT) set (for its virtual host), its redeclaration did not consider\r\n   the DQT during the [property equivalence check](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues#property-equivalence) stage.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11541](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11541)\r\n\r\n * Feature flag controller could run into a deadlock in some upgrade scenarios.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11414](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11414)\r\n\r\n * In mixed `3.13.x` and `3.12.x` clusters, when a [Direct Reply-to](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/direct-reply-to) client (the app that initiates requests)\r\n   was connected to the `3.13` node and the server (the app that responds) was connected to the `3.12` node,\r\n   the response was lost due to a message format conversion exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11401](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11401)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * In some parallel cluster formation scenarios where definitions were [imported on node boot](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/definitions#import-on-boot),\r\n   the virtual hosts created by the import can only be started on a subset of nodes. This is so\r\n   because not all cluster peers are known at virtual host creation time.\r\n\r\n   To reconcile (repair) this state, nodes will periodically check that all virtual hosts are initialized\r\n   on all cluster nodes. This happens every thirty seconds for the first five minutes\r\n   since node boot. As long as the cluster is fully formed within that amount of time,\r\n   all nodes will have performed initialization for all virtual hosts that exist.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11408](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11408)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queue leader replicas now initiate reconciliation (repair) of their\r\n   replicas, if there are any missing, more frequently, making quorum queues\r\n   more defensive in the case of (**highly discouraged**) [grow-then-shrink upgrades](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade#grow-then-shrink).\r\n\r\n   As part of this change, the CPU cost of reconciliation was reduced, now accounting\r\n   for less than 1% of the CPU with 10K quorum queues in some test environments.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11029](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/discussions/11029)\r\n\r\n * In the case where the `vhost_max` node limit is reached, the node will log specific errors\r\n   when a new virtual host is (unsuccessfully) added.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11589](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11589)\r\n\r\n * Elapsed time in the logs is now measured using [monotonic time](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11396](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11396)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_quorum_critical` could report a false positive\r\n   when some quorum queue replcas where very recently added or very recently restarted.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11524](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11524)\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmqctl list_unresponsive_queues` ran into an exception if there were connected MQTT clients\r\n   with QoS 0 subscriptions.\r\n\r\n   Partially contributed by @gomoripeti.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11434](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11434)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * CLI tools now can be built with Elixir 1.17.x.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @VlkrS.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11529](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11529)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * OpenID Connect discovery endpoint now can be overridden for identity providers with\r\n   non-standard configurations.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11103](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11103)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Virtual host metadata was not included into definition files exported via the HTTP API.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#10515](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10515)\r\n\r\n * When Khepri was enabled and a majority of cluster members were down, adding a virtual host\r\n   failed with an unhelpful exception.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11590](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11590)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * When default queue type is set on a virtual host but not for individual queues,\r\n   the exported queues will have `x-queue-type` set to the default type in the\r\n   exported definitions document.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#10515](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10515)\r\n\r\n * Management UI will now display the number of cores available to the node.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11382](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11382)\r\n\r\n * OAuth 2-specific JavaScript files are now only loaded if the OAuth 2 plugin is enabled\r\n   on the node.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11421](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11421)\r\n\r\n\r\n### HTTP AuthN/AuthZ Backend Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * TLS-related settings, in particular related to [peer certificate chain verification](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl#peer-verification), now can be\r\n   configured for this plugin:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   auth_http.ssl_options.verify = verify_none\r\n   auth_http.ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = false\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Please remember that disabling peer certificate chain verification makes the system\r\n   less secure and susceptible to [Man-in-the-Middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\r\n   Consider enabling the verification in production systems when possible.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#10281](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10281)\r\n\r\n\r\n### etcd Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The plugin failed to extract discovered nodes name correctly in earlier `3.13.x`\r\n   releases.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11445](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11445)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tracing Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `tracing.dir`, `tracing.username` and `tracing.password` are the three Tracing plugin\r\n   settings that can be set via `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#11554](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11554)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\n * Ra was [upgraded to `2.11.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)\r\n * Osiris was

contains additional changes that allow\n     Packer core to validate access a HCP Packer bucket before trying to\n     publish to it. If the bucket does not exist and the associated service\n     principle does not have permission to create the bucket Packer will fail\n     the build.[GH-13059](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13059)\n\n### SECURITY:\n* core: Bump github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp to address\n     CVE-2024-6104.[GH-13081](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13081)\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n* core/hcl2: The issue is that local variables in templates are evaluated in a\n     non-deterministic order, leading to inconsistent behavior. To fix this,\n     local variables will now build a list of direct dependencies, similar to\n     datasources, and evaluate these dependencies recursively. A caveat is that\n     there's a recursion cap of 10 to prevent infinite recursion; if this limit\n     is reached, an error is returned, prompting the user to fix their template.\n     [GH-13039](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13039)\n* core: bump github.com/hashicorp/hcp-sdk-go from 0.96.0 to 0.99.0\n     [GH-13063](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13063)\n* core: bump github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk from 0.5.3 to 0.5.4\n     [GH-13061](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13061)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n* core/hcp: Change UpsertBucket to call GetBucket to address unauthorized error\n     from ustream API.\n     [GH-13059](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/13059)\n\n", "created_at": "2024-07-01T13:30:27Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.30.3", "tag_name": "v1.30.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/releases/tag/v1.30.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o", "body": "- [CRI-O v1.30.3](#cri-o-v1303)\n  -

This change was done to make the `VStream` API more user-friendly, intuitive, and to align the behavior across both phases. Before [this change](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/15723) the values for [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) columns were string values in the copy phase but integer values (which only have an internal meaning to MySQL) in the streaming phase. This inconsistency led to various [challenges and issues](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15750) for each `VStream` client/consumer (e.g. the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html) failed to properly perform a snapshot for tables containing these column types). Now the behavior is intuitive \u2014 clients need the string values as the eventual sink is often not MySQL so each consumer needed to perform the mappings themselves \u2014 and consistent. While this is a (potentially) breaking change, a new boolean field has been added to the [`FieldEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#FieldEvent) message called `EnumSetStringValues`. When that field is `false` (in Vitess v19 and older) then the consumer will need to perform the mappings during streaming phase, but not during copy phase. When this field is `true`, then no mapping is required. This will help to ensure a smooth transition for all consumers over time. To demonstrate, let's look at the textual output (printing the received `VEvents` as strings) when streaming a single `enum_set_test` table from the unsharded `commerce` keyspace so that we can see what the VStream looks like before and after when we start a new VStream in copy/snapshot mode and then transition to streaming mode for the following table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `enum_set_test` (\r\n  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `shirt_size` enum('small','medium','large','xlarge','xxlarge') DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `hobbies` set('knitting','cooking','pickleball','biking','hiking','motorcycle','video games','reading') DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd with the table having this data when we start our `VStream` and begin the copy/snapshot phase:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nmysql> select * from enum_set_test;\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n| id | name      | shirt_size | hobbies                 |\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n|  1 | Billy Bob | xlarge     | cooking,reading         |\r\n|  2 | Sally Mae | medium     | knitting,cooking,hiking |\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally we will perform the following inserts and updates to the table during the streaming phase:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ninsert into enum_set_test values (3, \"Matt Lord\", 'medium', 'pickleball,biking,hiking,motorcycle,video games,reading');\r\ninsert into enum_set_test values (4, \"Jerry Badyellow\", 'large', '');\r\nupdate enum_set_test set shirt_size = 'small', hobbies = 'knitting,cooking,hiking,reading' where id = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nVitess v19 and

from Vitess v19 and older becomes `after:{lengths:1 lengths:9 lengths:5 lengths:31 values:\"2Sally Maesmallknitting,cooking,hiking,reading\"}` from Vitess v20 and newer. So `1` -> `small` and `147` -> `knitting,cooking,hiking,reading` for the `ENUM` and `SET` column values respectively. This also demonstrates why this mapping is necessary in consumers/clients, as `147` has no logical meaning/value for this column outside of MySQL internals.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html), you should upgrade your connector to 2.7 (the next release) \u2014 which should contain [the relevant necessary changes](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7792) \u2014 *prior to upgrading Vitess* to v20.0.1 or later. If you're using any of the PlanetScale connectors ([`AirByte`](https://github.com/planetscale/airbyte-source/), [`FiveTran`](https://github.com/planetscale/fivetran-source), or [`singer-tap`](https://github.com/planetscale/singer-tap)) then no actions are required.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a custom `VStream` client/consumer, then you will need to build a new client with the updated v20 [binlogdata protos](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata) ([source](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/binlogdata.proto) for which would be in `main` or the `release-20.0` branch) before needing to support Vitess v20.0.1 or later. Your client will then be able to handle old and new messages, with older messages always having this new field set to `false`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"shutdown-grace-period-default\"/>`shutdown_grace_period` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--shutdown_grace_period` flag, which was introduced in v2 with a default of `0 seconds`, has now been changed to default to `3 seconds`.\r\nThis makes reparenting in Vitess resilient to client errors, and prevents PlannedReparentShard from timing out.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the old behaviour, the users can set the flag back to `0 seconds` causing open transactions to never be shutdown, but in that case, they run the risk of PlannedReparentShard calls timing out.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"unmanaged-flag\"/> New `unmanaged` Flag and `disable_active_reparents` deprecation\r\n\r\nNew flag `--unmanaged` has been introduced in this release to make it easier to flag unmanaged tablets. It also runs validations to make sure the unmanaged tablets are configured properly. `--disable_active_reparents` flag has been deprecated for `vttablet`, `vtcombo` and `vttestserver` binaries and will be removed in future releases. Specifying the `--unmanaged` flag will also block replication commands and replication repairs.\r\n\r\nStarting this release, all unmanaged tablets should specify this flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"recovery-block-deprecation\"/> `recovery-period-block-duration` Flag deprecation\r\n\r\nThe flag `--recovery-period-block-duration` has been deprecated in VTOrc from this release. Its value is now ignored and the flag will be removed in later releases.\r\nVTOrc no longer blocks recoveries for a certain duration after a previous recovery has completed. Since VTOrc refreshes the required information after\r\nacquiring a shard lock, blocking of recoveries is not required.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"mysqlctld-onterm-timeout\"/>`mysqlctld` `onterm_timeout` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--onterm_timeout` flag default value has changed for `mysqlctld`. It now is by default long enough to be able to wait for the default `--shutdown-wait-time` when shutting down on a `TERM` signal. \r\n\r\nThis is necessary since otherwise MySQL would never shut down cleanly with the old defaults, since `mysqlctld` would shut down already after 10 seconds by default.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"move-tables-auto-increment\"/>`MoveTables` now removes `auto_increment` clauses by default when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one\r\n\r\nA new `--remove-sharded-auto-increment` flag has been added to the [`MoveTables` create sub-command](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and it is set to `true` by default. This flag controls whether any [MySQL `auto_increment`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/example-auto-increment.html) clauses should be removed from the table definitions when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one. This is now done by default as `auto_increment` clauses should not typically be used with sharded tables and you should instead rely on externally generated values such as a form of universally/globally unique identifiers or use [Vitess sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/) in order to ensure that each row has a unique identifier (Primary Key value) across all shards. If for some reason you want to retain them you can set this new flag to `false` when creating the workflow.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"durabler-interface-method-renaming\"/>`Durabler` interface method renaming\r\n\r\nThe methods of [the `Durabler` interface](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil/durability.go#L70-L79) in `go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil` were renamed to be public _(capitalized)_ methods to make it easier to integrate custom Durability Policies from external packages. See [RFC for details](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15544).\r\n\r\nUsers of custom Durability Policies must rename private `Durabler` methods.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- The `promotionRule` method was renamed to `PromotionRule`\r\n- The `semiSyncAckers` method was renamed to `SemiSyncAckers`\r\n- The `isReplicaSemiSync` method was renamed to `IsReplicaSemiSync`\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"query-compatibility\"/>Query Compatibility\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vindex-hints\"/> Vindex Hints\r\n\r\nVitess now supports Vindex hints that provide a way for users to influence the shard routing of queries in Vitess by specifying, which vindexes should be considered or ignored by the query planner. This feature enhances the control over query execution, allowing for potentially more efficient data access patterns in sharded databases.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n ```sql\r\n    SELECT * FROM user USE VINDEX (hash_user_id, secondary_vindex) WHERE user_id = 123;\r\n    SELECT * FROM order IGNORE VINDEX (range_order_id) WHERE order_date = '2021-01-01';\r\n ```\r\n\r\nFor more information about Vindex hints and its usage, please consult the documentation.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"update-limit\"/> Update with Limit Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded update with limit.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 set t1.foo = 'abc', t1.bar = 23 where t1.baz > 5 limit 1`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys and then performing an update with those primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"multi-table-update\"/> Update with Multi Table Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi-table update with column update on single target table using multiple table join.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col set t1.baz = 'abc', t1.apa = 23 where t3.foo = 5 and t2.bar = 7`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys and then performing an update with those primary keys.\r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"update-multi-target\"/> Update with Multi Target Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target update.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id set t1.foo = 'abc', t2.bar = 23`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys from all target tables and \r\nthen performing an update for each table with their selected primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"delete-subquery\"/> Delete with Subquery Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded table delete with subquery\r\n\r\nExample: `delete from t1 where id in (select col from t2 where foo = 32 and bar = 43)`\r\n\r\nThe support is built by performing the uncorrelated subquery first and then providing the value for deletion.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"delete-multi-target\"/> Delete with Multi Target Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target delete.\r\n\r\nExample: `delete t1, t3 from t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys from all target tables and \r\nthen performing a delete operation for each table with their selected primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"udf-support\"/> User Defined Functions Support\r\n\r\nVTGate can track any user defined functions for better planning.\r\nUser Defined Functions (UDFs) should be directly loaded in the underlying MySQL.\r\n\r\nIt should be enabled in VTGate with the `--track-udfs` flag.\r\nThis will enable the tracking of UDFs in VTGate and will be used for planning.\r\nWithout this flag, VTGate will not be aware that there might be aggregating user-defined functions in the query that need to be pushed down to MySQL.\r\n\r\nMore details about how to load UDFs is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/adding-loadable-function.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"insert-row-alias-support\"/> Insert Row Alias Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added to have row alias in Insert statement to be used with `on duplicate key update`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new on duplicate key update name = new.name, email = new.email`\r\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new(m, n, p) on duplicate key update name = n, email = p`\r\n\r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html)\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout\r\nOn a query timeout, Vitess closed the connection using the `kill connection` statement. This leads to connection churn \r\nwhich is not desirable in some cases. To avoid this, Vitess now uses the `kill query` statement to cancel the query. \r\nThis will only cancel the query and does not terminate the connection.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"flag-changes\"/>Flag Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"pprof-http-default\"/> `pprof-http` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--pprof-http` flag, which was introduced in v19 with a default of `true`, has now been changed to default to `false`.\r\nThis makes HTTP `pprof` endpoints now an *opt-in* feature, rather than opt-out.\r\nTo continue enabling these endpoints, explicitly set `--pprof-http` when starting up Vitess components.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"healthcheck-dial-concurrency-flag\"/>New `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag\r\n\r\nThe new `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag defines the maximum number of healthcheck connections that can open concurrently. This limit is to avoid hitting Go runtime panics on deployments watching enough tablets [to hit the runtime's maximum thread limit of `10000`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMaxThreads) due to blocking network syscalls. This flag applies to `vtcombo`, `vtctld` and `vtgate` only and a value less than the runtime max thread limit _(`10000`)_ is recommended.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"buffer_min_time_between_failovers-flag\"/>New minimum for `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers`\r\n\r\nThe `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers` `vttablet` flag now has a minimum value of `1s`. This is because a value of 0 can cause issues with the buffering mechanics resulting in unexpected and unnecessary query errors \u2014 in particular during `MoveTables SwitchTraffic` operations. If you are currently specifying a value of 0 for this flag then you will need to update the config value to 1s *prior to upgrading to v20 or later* as `vttablet` will report an error and terminate if you attempt to start it with a value of 0.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-track-udfs-flag\"/>New `--track-udfs` vtgate flag\r\n\r\nThe new `--track-udfs` flag enables VTGate to track user defined functions for better planning.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"documentation-lock-timeout\"/>Help text fix for `--lock-timeout`\r\n\r\nThe help text for the flag `--lock-timeout` was incorrect. We were documenting it as a flag that controlled the duration for which the shard lock was acquired. It is actually the maximum duration for which we wait while attempting to acquire a lock from the topology server.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"querylog-sample-rate-flag\"/>New `--querylog-sample-rate` flag\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--querylog-sample-rate float` adds support for sampling queries based on a float value between 0.0 _(no logging)_ and 1.0 _(all queries logged)_. If configured, this filtering is applied after the existing `--querylog-filter-tag` filter.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"tablet-filter-tags-flag\"/>New `--tablet-filter-tags` flag\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--tablet-filter-tags StringMap` adds support to VTGate for filtering tablets by tablet tag key/values, specified as comma-separated list of key:values. The tags of a tablet are defined by the VTTablet flag `--init_tags`, which is also defined as a comma-separated list of key:values.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"multi-tenant\"/> Multi-tenant Imports\r\n\r\nSupport for multi-tenant imports has been added to `MoveTables`. If you have a multi-tenant architecture where each\r\ntenant has their own database, you can import the tenants using multiple `MoveTables` workfows, one per tenant.\r\nEach import is initiated with the new `--tenant-id` flag. The column name (and data type) need to be specified in\r\nthe VSchema of the target keyspace.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vdiff-online-ddl\"/> VDiff support for OnlineDDL migrations\r\n\r\nYou can now run `VDiff`s on OnlineDDL schema change migrations, which are not yet cut over.\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor Changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New Stats\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-query-cache-hits-and-misses\"/>VTTablet Query Cache Hits and Misses\r\n\r\nVTTablet exposes two new counter stats:\r\n\r\n * `QueryCacheHits`: Query engine query plan cache hits\r\n * `QueryCacheMisses`: Query engine query plan cache misses\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> `QueryCache` does not refer to a query cache, but to a query plan cache.\r\n> In v21, these metrics will be deprecated and renamed.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet-query-text-characters-processed\"/>VTTablet Query Text Characters Processed\r\n\r\nVTGate and VTTablet expose a new counter stat `QueryTextCharactersProcessed` to reflect the number of query text characters processed.\r\n\r\nVTGate groups this metric by Operation, Keyspace and TabletType. On VTTablet it is grouped by Table, Plan and optionally Workload.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"sighup-reload-of-grpc-client-auth-creds\"/>`SIGHUP` reload of gRPC client static auth creds\r\n\r\nThe internal gRPC client now caches the static auth credentials and supports reloading via the `SIGHUP` signal. Previous to v20 the credentials were not cached. They were re-loaded from disk on every use.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"updated-node\"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v20.12.2 (LTS)\r\n\r\nBuilding `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v20.12.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v18 to v20 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.\r\nFull details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.2.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"replaced-highcharts\"/>Replaced highcharts with d3\r\n\r\nThe vtadmin-web UI no longer has a dependency on highcharts for licensing reasons. The tablet QPS, tablet VReplication QPS, and workflow streams lag charts have all been replaced by d3. We'll be iteratively improving the d3 charts until they reach feature parity with the original highcharts charts. \r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/20.0/20.0.0/changelog.md).\r\n\r\nThe release includes 419 merged Pull Requests.\r\n\r\nThanks to all our contributors: @Aoang, @Ari1009, @GuptaManan100, @Its-Maniaco, @Maniktherana, @VaibhavMalik4187, @ajm188, @aparajon, @app/dependabot, @app/github-actions, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @bddicken, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @crazeteam, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @derekperkins, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pavedroad, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @tycol7, @vitess-bot, @vmg, @wangweicugw, @whuang8, @yoheimuta\r\n", "created_at": "2024-06-27T05:01:40Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.36.0-rc.0", "tag_name": "v0.36.0-rc.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.36.0-rc.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos", "body": "The first release candidate of v0.36.0 is out! \r\n\r\nWe have mostly dependency bumps and bugfixes but some minor breaking changes, please see the changelog below for details.\r\n\r\nThank you to all contributors who have contributed to this release.

For more information, see [CVE-2023-32196](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-64jq-m7rq-768h).\r\n- Supported RKE versions in Rancher are updated to [v1.4.19](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.19) and [v1.5.10](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.5.10) to fix [CVE-2023-32191](https://github.com/rancher/rke/security/advisories/GHSA-6gr4-52w6-vmqx), where credentials are stored inside a ConfigMap that can be accessible by non-administrative users in Rancher. This vulnerability only affects an RKE provisioned cluster.\r\n- Rancher now has a user retention process, for when external authentication providers are used, that can be configured to run periodically and disable and/or delete inactive users. The user retention process is disabled by default. If enabled, a user becomes subject to the retention process if they don't log in for a configurable period of time. It's possible to set overrides for users who are used mainly for programmatic access (e.g. CI, scripts, etc.) so that they don't become subject to the retention process for a longer period of time or at all. For more information, see [CVE-2023-22650](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-9ghh-mmcq-8phc).\r\n- Fixed an issue where custom secrets encryption configurations were being stored in plaintext under the clusters `AppliedSpec`. This was also causing clusters to continuously reconcile, as the `AppliedSpec` would never match the desired cluster `Spec`. The information stored here contains the encryption configuration for secrets within etcd, and could potentially expose sensitive data if the etcd database was exposed directly. For more information, see [#45800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45800) and [CVE-2024-22032](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-q6c7-56cq-g2wm).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) page or in Rancher's [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories) repo.\r\n\r\n## Rancher Webhook\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- The Rancher-Webhook version is not set in the settings and the environment variable is empty, allowing the webhook to be automatically upgraded to newer versions. Each Rancher version is designed to be compatible with a single version of the webhook. See [#45418](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45418).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.8.5\r\n\r\n<!-- TODO verify -->\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.8.4](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.8.4)\r\n- RKE - [v1.5.10](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.5.10)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.28.10 (Default)\r\n- v1.27.14\r\n- v1.26.15\r\n- v1.25.16\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.28.10 (Default)\r\n- v1.27.14\r\n- v1.26.15\r\n- v1.25.16\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nDual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI has been experimental since v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - The controller now cleans up instances of `ClusterUserAttribute` that have no corresponding `UserAttribute`. See [#44985](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44985).\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.3:**\r\n  - When Rancher starts, it now identifies all deprecated and unrecognized setting resources and adds a `cattle.io/unknown` label. You can list these settings with the command `kubectl get settings -l 'cattle.io/unknown==true'`. In Rancher v2.9 and later, these settings will be removed instead. See [#43992](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43992).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher Compose is no longer supported, and all parts of it are being removed in the v2.8 release line. See [#43341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43341).\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.23 and v1.24 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.25 or later. See [#42828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42828).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - Docker CLI 20.x is at end-of-life and no longer supported in Rancher. Please update your local Docker CLI versions to 23.0.x or later. Earlier versions may not recognize OCI compliant Rancher image manifests. See [#45424](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45424).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Kontainer Engine v1 (KEv1) provisioning and the respective cluster drivers are now deprecated. KEv1 provided plug-ins for different targets using cluster drivers. The Rancher-maintained cluster drivers for EKS, GKE and AKS have been replaced by the hosted provider drivers, EKS-Operator, GKE-Operator and AKS-Operator. Node drivers are now available for self-managed Kubernetes.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When you provision a downstream cluster, the cluster's name must conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n  - Privilege escalation is disabled by default when creating deployments from the Rancher API. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke1) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#43175](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43175).\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated. Weave will be removed in RKE v1.30. See [#42730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42730).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE2 clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke2) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#42749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42749).\r\n  - Similar to Rancher v2.7.9, when you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0 with provisioned RKE2/K3s clusters in an unhealthy state, you may encounter the error message, `implausible joined server for entry`. This requires manually marking the nodes in the cluster with a joined server. See [#42856](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42856).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster API <!-- highlander -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The `cluster-api` core provider controllers run in a pod in the `cattle-provisioning-cattle-system` namespace, within the local cluster. These controllers are installed with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/rancher/provisioning). Previously, Rancher ran `cluster-api` controllers in an embedded fashion. This change makes it easier to maintain `cluster-api` versioning. See [#41094](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41094).\r\n  - The token hashing algorithm generates new tokens using SHA3. Existing tokens that don't use SHA3 won't be re-hashed. This change affects ClusterAuthTokens (the downstream synced version of tokens for ACE) and Tokens (only when token hashing is enabled). SHA3 tokens should work with ACE and Token Hashing. Tokens that don't use SHA3 may not work when ACE and token hashing are used in combination. If, after upgrading to Rancher v2.7.7, you experience issues with ACE while token hashing is enabled, re-generate any applicable tokens. See [#42062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/42062).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The built-in `restricted-admin` role is being deprecated in favor of a more flexible global role configuration, which is now available for different use cases other than only the `restricted-admin`. If you want to replicate the permissions given through this role, use the new `inheritedClusterRoles` feature to create a custom global role. A custom global role, like the `restricted-admin` role, grants permissions on all downstream clusters. See [#42462](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42462). Given its deprecation, the `restricted-admin` role will continue to be included in future builds of Rancher through the v2.8.x and v2.9.x release lines. However, in accordance with the CVSS standard, only security issues scored as critical will be backported and fixed in the `restricted-admin` role until it is completely removed from Rancher. <!-- Security 1249 -->\r\n  - Reverse DNS server functionality has been removed. The associated [`rancher/rdns-server`](https://github.com/rancher/rdns-server) repository is now archived. Reverse DNS is already disabled by default. <!--Rancher security 1201 -->\r\n  - The Rancher CLI configuration file `~/.rancher/cli2.json` previously had permissions set to `0644`. Although `0644` would usually indicate that all users have read access to the file, the parent directory would block users' access. New Rancher CLI configuration files will only be readable by the owner (`0600`). Invoking the CLI will trigger a warning, in case old configuration files are world-readable or group-readable. See [#42838](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42838).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Helm Chart) <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app in a RKE2/K3s cluster, if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows. Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters.<!-- no issue number --><!-- introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Rancher uses additional trusted CAs when establishing a secure connection to the keycloak OIDC authentication provider. See [#43217](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43217).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting has been replaced by the setting, `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, and is no longer available in the UI. See [#38535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38535).\r\n  - [API tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens) now have default time periods after which they expire. Authentication tokens expire after 90 days, while kubeconfig tokens expire after 30 days. See [#41919](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41919).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - The embedded Cluster API webhook is removed from the Rancher webhook and can no longer be installed from the webhook chart. It has not been used as of Rancher v2.7.7, where it was migrated to a separate Pod. See [#44619](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44619).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher's webhook now honors the `bind` and `escalate` verbs for GlobalRoles. Users who have `*` set on GlobalRoles will now have both of these verbs, and could potentially use them to escalate privileges in Rancher v2.8.0 and later. You should review current custom GlobalRoles, especially cases where `bind`, `escalate`, or `*` are granted, before you upgrade.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - Rancher installs the same pinned version of the `rancher-webhook` chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n  - The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Legacy code for the following v1 charts is no longer available in the [`rancher/system-charts`](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts) repository:\r\n\r\n    - `rancher-cis-benchmark`\r\n    - `rancher-gatekeeper-operator`\r\n    - `rancher-istio`\r\n    - `rancher-logging`\r\n    - `rancher-monitoring`\r\n\r\n    The code for these charts will remain available for previous versions of Rancher.\r\n  - Helm v2 support is deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line and will be removed in Rancher v2.9.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type `Application`. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some necessary actions within Azure AD, causing errors.<!-- no issue number --><!--introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n  - The multi-cluster app legacy feature is no longer available. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - OPA Gatekeeper\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - OPA Gatekeeper is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As a replacement for OPA Gatekeeper, consider [switching to Kubewarden](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/opa-comparison). See [#42627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42627).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - A configurable `priorityClass` is available in the Rancher pod and its feature charts. Previously, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - If you use a version of backup-restore older than v102.0.2+up3.1.2 to take a backup of Rancher v2.7.7, the migration will encounter a `capi-webhook` error. Make sure that the chart version used for backups is v102.0.2+up3.1.2, which has `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources removed from the resourceSet. If you can't use v102.0.2+up3.1.2 for backups, delete all `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources from the backup tar before using it. See [#382](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/pull/382).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging. Previously, the default image was Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n    - Rancher aggregates the changed counts and only sends a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n    - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, with a significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s respects the `managedBy` annotation. In its initial release, Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false`, since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Security\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer supported for Rancher app ingresses. See [#42027](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42027).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Extensions\r\n\r\n- **Rancher 2.8.4:**\r\n  - The Rancher dashboard fails to load an extension that utilizes backported Vue 3 features, displaying an error in the console `object(...) is not a function`. New extensions that utilize the `defineComponent` will not be backwards compatible with older versions of the dashboard. Existing extensions should continue to work moving forward. See [#10568](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10568).  \r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - If you use a GKE based local cluster and attempt to provision a GKE v1.24 or newer cluster through the Rancher UI, the **Image Type** displays two invalid options, **Ubuntu with Docker** and **Container Optimized OS with Docker**. Do not use these two image types, cluster provisioning will fail if you attempt to do so. See [#10600](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10600).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n  - You need to force-refresh the Rancher UI after initial Rancher setup, to trigger the prompt to accept the self-signed certificate. As a workaround, visit the Rancher portal, accept the self-signed certificate, and go through the setup process. Once done, go to the address bar of your browser and click the lock icon. Select the option to allow you to receive certificate errors for the Rancher website. You'll then be prompted again to accept the new certificate. See [#7867](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7867).\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. This is a benign error that occurs as part of the upgrade process, and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n- **Rancher 2.6.1:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type `ClusterIP` to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port won't be created upon your first attempt to save the new port. You must repeat the procedure to add the port again. The Service Type field will display `Do not create a service` during the second procedure. Change this to `ClusterIP` and save to create the new port. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Scaling up etcd nodes on RKE may fail, with nodes stuck waiting to register with Kubernetes. This causes the cluster to hang. There are two workarounds available, depending on whether the cluster is active or hanging. See [#43356](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43356).  \r\n    - Workaround for active clusters:\r\n      - Add one etcd node, wait for the cluster to become active again, then repeat as needed.\r\n    - Workaround for hanging clusters:\r\n      1. Delete the stuck etcd nodes.\r\n      1. Find the leader pod: `kubectl -n kube-system get configmap cattle-controller`\r\n      1. Restart the leader pod. This terminates the GRPC goroutine.\r\n      1. Wait for the stuck nodes to be removed.\r\n      1. Add one etcd node, wait for the cluster to become active again, then repeat as needed.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Scaling down etcd node pools on RKE2/K3s machine-provisioned clusters may cause unexpected behavior. To avoid this, define multiple machine pools for etcd nodes, each with a quantity of one. You can then scale down simply by deleting machine pools. As a further mitigation, have a robust backup strategy and store your etcd snapshots in a safe location. Restoring from an etcd snapshot allows you to return the cluster to an operational state if you're affected by unexpected behaviors. See [#42582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42582) and [#43097](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43097).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Scaling down etcd nodes on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters may inadvertently delete all etcd nodes in the pool. This is linked to an [upstream cluster-api bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/9334) that causes the controllers to delete more than the desired quantity of etcd nodes when reconciling an RKE Machine Pool. This issue affects etcd node scale-down operations on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters. To help mitigate the issue, have a robust backup strategy and store your etcd snapshots in a safe location. See [#42582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42582).\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.4:**\r\n  - RKE2 clusters with invalid values for tolerations or affinity agent customizations don't display an error message, and remain in an `Updating` state. This causes cluster creation to hang. See [#41606](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41606).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.9:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - When provisioning clusters with an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners doesn't take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. As a workaround, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128).<!-- first appears in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.3 as https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689 which redirects to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Amazon ECR Private Registries don't work from RKE2/K3s. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920). \r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- Scaling down etcd nodes on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters may inadvertently delete all etcd nodes in the pool. This is linked to an [upstream cluster-api bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/9334) that causes the controllers to delete more than the desired quantity of etcd nodes when reconciling an RKE Machine Pool. This issue affects etcd node scale-down operations on K3s/RKE2 machine-provisioned clusters. To help mitigate the issue, have a robust backup strategy and store your etcd snapshots in a safe location. See [#42582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42582).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node.

See [#11014](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11014).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cloud Credentials <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When enabling some custom node drivers, the **Cloud Credential** creation page does not show the correct default fields and has an uneditable `foo` key. See [#8563](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8563).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Docker Install <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Single node Rancher won't start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or later. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.0:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to longer startup times. When launching Docker for the first time, you'll receive an error message stating, \"Cannot read property `endsWith` of undefined\", as described in [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).  You'll then be directed to a login screen. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Windows <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.7:**\r\n  - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.<!-- no issue number--><!-- seems to first appear in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.7. v2.6.6 has brief release notes. v2.6.5 doesn't mention it -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Issues - Windows Nodes in RKE2 Clusters\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.5:**\r\n  - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes must reboot after the upgrade completes. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - AKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658#issuecomment-733035658) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.x:**\r\n  - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).<!-- no mention of patch version in issue thread, milestone is simply v2.6, already appear as a longstanding issue in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.0 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - When editing or upgrading an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).<!-- first proposed as a release note for https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561#issuecomment-879272354 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - GKE\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to Kubernetes v1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - After an upgrade from Rancher v2.7.2 - v2.7.6, Rancher doesn't update the PSA configuration template, `rancher-restricted`, to include `cattle-provisioning-capi-system` and `cattle-fleet-local-system` under the `exemptions.namespaces` list. As a workaround, [manually update](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/psa-config-templates#add-or-edit-a-pod-security-admissions-psa-configuration-template) `rancher-restricted` to add `cattle-provisioning-capi-system` and `cattle-fleet-local-system` under the `exemptions.namespaces` list. See [#43150](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43150).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - The deployment's `securityContext` section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy (PSP) support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).<!-- https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815#issuecomment-1074184973 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The SAML authentication pop-up throws a `404` error on high-availability RKE installations. Single node Docker installations aren't affected. If you refresh the browser window and select **Resend**, the authentication request will succeed, and you will be able to log in. See [#31163](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31163).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.2:**\r\n  - Users on certain LDAP setups don't have permission to search LDAP. When they attempt to perform a search, they receive the error message, `Result Code 32 \"No Such Object\"`. See [#35259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35259).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Encryption\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.4:**\r\n  - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - When provisioning a Harvester RKE1 cluster in Rancher, the **vGPU** field is not displayed under **Cluster Management > Advanced Settings**, this is not a supported feature. However, the **vGPU** field is available when provisioning a Harvester RKE2 cluster. See [#10909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10909).\r\n  - When provisioning a multi-node Harvester RKE2 cluster in Rancher, you need to allocate one vGPU more than the number of nodes you have or provisioning will fail. See [#11009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11009).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery <!-- fleet --> <!-- use function based naming from https://jira.suse.com/browse/SURE-6864? e.g. \"Continuous Deployment with Fleet?\" -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Target customization can produce custom resources that exceed the Rancher API's maximum bundle size. This results in `Request entity too large` errors when attempting to add a GitHub repo. Only target customizations that modify the Helm chart URL or version are affected. As a workaround, use multiple paths or GitHub repos instead of target customization. See [#1650](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1650).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment, rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancherlabs/release-notes/pull/139-->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.5:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - CIS Scan <!-- neo/security -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Some CIS checks related to file permissions fail on RKE and RKE2 clusters with CIS v1.7 and CIS v1.8 profiles. See [#42971](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42971).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail. The backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion `v1beta1`. There are two workarounds for this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Istio <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- Istio v1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes v1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes v1.23 until the next charts' release.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Read-only project permissions and the View Monitoring role aren't sufficient to view links on the Monitoring index page. Users won't be able to see monitoring links. As a workaround, you can perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n    1. If you haven't already, install Monitoring on the project.\r\n    1. Move the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace into the project.\r\n    1. Grant project users the View Monitoring (`monitoring-ui-view`) role, and `read-only` or higher permissions on at least one project in the cluster.\r\n\r\n    See [#4466](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4466).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658#issuecomment-733035658) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).", "created_at": "2024-06-13T21:14:02Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.11.6rc2", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/influxdata/influxdb/commits/c7a591b57cd3a9b91016953b2d6936fd49c58d99", "repo_url": "https://github.com/influxdata/influxDb", "body": "fix: prevent retention service from hanging (#25064)\n\nFix issue that can cause the retention service to hang waiting on a\r\n`Shard.Close` call. When this occurs, no other shards will be deleted\r\nby the retention service. This is usually noticed as an increase in\r\ndisk usage because old shards are not cleaned up.\r\n\r\nThe fix adds to new methods to `Store`, `SetShardNewReadersBlocked`\r\nand `InUse`. `InUse` can be used to poll if a shard has active readers,\r\nwhich the retention service uses to skip over in-use shards to prevent\r\nthe service from hanging. `SetShardNewReadersBlocked` determines if\r\nnew read access may be granted to a shard. This is required to prevent\r\nrace conditions around the use of `InUse` and the deletion of shards.\r\n\r\nIf the retention service skips over a shard because it is in-use, the\r\nshard will be checked again the next time the retention service is run.\r\nIt can be deleted on subsequent checks if it is no longer in-use.

Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.\r\n> When `Automatically generate SBOM on push` is enabled and there are massive concurrent push to that project, users may need to enable asynchronously updating project quota by setting `core.quotaUpdateProvider: redis` (values.yaml for harbor-helm) or setting [core.quota_update_provider: redis](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/v2.11.0/make/harbor.yml.tmpl#L316) (`harbor.yml` for installation via docker-compose) so that it can reduce the overall resource consumption, like db connection, cpu usage and memory usage.\r\n\r\n#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\nHarbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry\r\nUsers can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation\r\nThe user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by @liubin in

For the most disruptive operations, particularly\r\nthose that break rolling-update of the cluster, we have started to use deferred\r\ndeletion to minimize the impact.  For example, on AWS we create a second NLB\r\nduring the `kops update` phase when we cannot change the NLB directly.\r\n`kops update` will report that a `--prune` is needed.  To minimize disruption,\r\nwe recommend you perform this after a rolling-update, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkops update $MYCLUSTER --yes --admin\r\nkops rolling-update $MYCLUSTER --yes\r\nkops update $MYCLUSTER --yes --admin --prune # NEW!\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeferred deletion is currently used to safely introduce security groups for NLBs on AWS,\r\nand to move to an internal load balancer for `kops-controller` on GCP.\r\n\r\n## Initial OpenTelemetry Support\r\n\r\nWe are starting to add (experimental) support for OpenTelemetry,\r\nin particular Tracing support.  Setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_FILE`\r\nwill write a trace file which can then be read by the traceserver program.\r\nMore information and options are described in [docs/opentelemetry.md](/docs/opentelemetry.md).\r\nThe tracing data is not expected to be particularly useful for end-users in\r\nthis release; the (non-standard) recording approach is instead intended to\r\nwork well with our Prow end-to-end testing system so that developers can\r\noptimize kOps.\r\n\r\nPlease note: this is *not* telemetry in the \"phone-home\" sense.\r\nThe kOps project does not collect data from your machine.  As an\r\nopen-source project we do not even want to collect any of your data.\r\nCurrently the only OpenTelemetry backend supported is writing to a\r\nfilesystem (and it is opt-in).  In future you will be able to configure\r\nother OpenTelemetry backends, but this data will only be sent if\r\nyou enable OpenTelemetry, and only sent to where you configure.\r\n\r\n## AWS\r\n\r\n* Network Load Balancers in front of the Kubernetes API and bastion hosts now\r\nhave a security group attached. These security groups are used for security group rules\r\nallowing incoming traffic to the NLBs as well as traffic between the NLBs and their target\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n* Posts event data to URL upon instance interruption action in aws-node-termination-handler with `WEBHOOK_URL`.\r\n\r\n## GCP\r\n\r\n* As of Kubernetes version 1.29, credentials for private GCR/AR repositories will be handled by the out-of-tree credential provider. This is an additional binary that each instance downloads from the assets repository.\r\n* Two additional `StorageClasses` are created on GCP clusters. These are called `balanced-csi` and `ssd-csi` and utilize the GCP Balanced and SSD Persistent Disk volume types respectively.\r\n* **Breaking Change** - the default `StorageClass` has been changed from `standard-csi` to `balanced-csi`.\r\n\r\n* We now use a private load-balancer for in-cluster traffic on GCP, which allows us\r\n  to use network tags to restrict access only to the cluster nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* `kops toolbox dump` limits the number of nodes dumped to 500 by default. Use `--max-nodes` to override.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.23 has been removed.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n* The Amazon VPC CNI is now compatible with Ubuntu 22.04. Fix applied via [kubernetes/kops#16313](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/16313).\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.24 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.30.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.25 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.31.\r\n\r\n* Support for AWS Classic Load Balancer for API is deprecated and should not be used for newly created clusters.\r\n\r\n* All unmanaged addons (in `addons/`) are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's

[MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/): support filtering by multiple numeric constants via `q == (C1, ..., CN)` and `q != (C1, ..., CN)` syntax. For example, `status_code == (200, 201, 300)` returns `status_code` metrics with any of `200`, `201` or `300` values, while `status_code != (400, 404, 500)` returns `status_code` metrics with all the values except of `400`, `404` and `500`.\r\n* FEATURE: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/): add support for fault domain awareness to `vmselect`. It can be configured to return full responses if up to `-globalReplicationFactor - 1` fault domains (aka `vmstorage` groups) are unavailable. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6054) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/cluster-victoriametrics/#vmstorage-groups-at-vmselect).\r\n* FEATURE: all VictoriaMetrics [enterprise](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/enterprise/) components: add support for automatic issuing of TLS certificates for HTTPS server at `-httpListenAddr` via [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#automatic-issuing-of-tls-certificates) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5949).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/single-server-victoriametrics/): support disable or log [implicit conversions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/metricsql/#implicit-query-conversions) for subquery with cmd-line flags `-search.disableImplicitConversion` and `-search.logImplicitConversion`. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/4338).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support data replication additionally to sharding among remote storage systems if `-remoteWrite.shardByURLReplicas=N` command-line flag is set additionally to `-remoteWrite.shardByURL` command-line flag, where `N` is desired replication factor. This allows setting up data replication among failure domains when the replication factor is smaller than the number of failure domains. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6054).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): reduce CPU usage when [sharding among remote storage systems](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#sharding-among-remote-storages) is enabled.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): support [DNS SRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record) addresses in `-remoteWrite.url` command-line option and in scrape target urls. For example, `-remoteWrite.url=http://srv+victoria-metrics/api/v1/write` automatically resolves the `victoria-metrics` DNS SRV to a list of hostnames with TCP ports and then sends the collected metrics to these TCP addresses. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/#srv-urls) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6053).\r\n* FEATURE: [stream aggregation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/): allow skipping first N aggregation intervals via cmd-line flag `-streamAggr.ignoreFirstIntervals` for [Single-node VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/) or `-remoteWrite.streamAggr.ignoreFirstIntervals` for [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/). See more details [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/stream-aggregation/#ignore-aggregation-intervals-on-start).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support automatic discovering and load balancing for TCP addresses behind DNS SRV addresses. These addresses can be put inside `url_prefix` urls in the form `http://srv+addr/path`, where the `addr` is the [DNS SRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record) address, which is automatically resolved to hostnames with TCP ports. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#srv-urls) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support specifying client TLS certificates and TLS ServerName for requests to HTTPS backends. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#backend-tls-setup).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): support regex matching when routing incoming requests based on HTTP [query args](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) via `src_query_args` option at `url_map`. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/#generic-http-proxy-for-different-backends) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6070).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): optimize auto-suggestion performance for metric names when the database contains big number of unique time series.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): in the Select component, user-entered values are now preserved on blur if they match options in the list.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): auto-suggestion triggers at any cursor position in the query input. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/5864).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): update error messages on the Query page for enhanced clarity. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/6177).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling): skip unnecessary index lookups if downsampling wasn't set for ENT versions of VictoriaMetrics. Before, users of VictoriaMetrics ENT could have experience elevated CPU usage even if no downsampling was configured. The issue was introduced in [v1.100.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11000).  \r\n* BUGFIX: [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling): properly populate downsampling metadata for data parts created by VictoriaMetrics ENT versions lower than v1.100.0. The bug could trigger the downsampling actions for parts that were downsampled already. This bug doesn't have any negative effect apart from spending extra CPU resources on the repeated downsampling. The issue was introduced in [v1.100.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/changelog/#v11000). \r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): supported any status codes from the range 200-299 from alertmanager. Previously, only 200 status code considered a successful action. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6110).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): avoid blocking `/api/v1/rules`, `/api/v1/alerts`, `/metrics` APIs when alerting rule uses template functions `query`, which could takes a while to execute. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6079).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert/): fix links with anchors in vmalert's UI. Starting from [v1.99.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.99.0) vmalert could ignore anchors pointing to specific rule groups if `search` param was present in URL.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth/): don't treat concurrency limit hit as an error of the backend. Previously, hitting the concurrency limit would increment both `vmauth_concurrent_requests_limit_reached_total` and `vmauth_user_request_backend_errors_total` counters. Now, only concurrency limit counter is incremented.

With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.\r\nA successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.\r\nPlease ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.\r\n\r\n### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names\r\n\r\nStarting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:\r\n\r\n- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"utf8-strict-mode\"`.\r\n\r\n- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.\r\n\r\nShould you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"classic-mode\"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-02-28T11:46:46Z", "project": "Alertmanager", "repo": "prometheus/alertmanager", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.6.3", "tag_name": "v2.6.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.6.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.6.3 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis release mainly introduces several bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.

For further details, refer to PR #4851.\r\n\r\n### Release Histories Retention\r\nUsers can now adjust how many release histories to keep for each namespace, reducing the risk of too many histories overloading the database. For more info, please see the [documentation](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide?id=_3212-apollorelease-historyretentionsize-number-of-retained-configurations-release-history).\r\n\r\n### Log Directory Relocated to /opt/logs\r\nThe log files for Apollo ConfigService, AdminService, and Portal are now all in `/opt/logs`, instead of in separate folders like `/opt/logs/10003171`, `/opt/logs/10003172`, and `/opt/logs/10003173`.\r\n\r\n### Create Applications with OpenAPI\r\nOpen API consumer tokens now include a flag indicating permission to create applications. When set to 'yes', users are enabled to create applications using the consumer token through the Open API.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/assets/837658/6b20ea90-fb22-438f-b44e-f9adb8c5945d)\r\n\r\n### Grayscale Functionality for Non-Properties Namespaces\r\nGrayscale release is
