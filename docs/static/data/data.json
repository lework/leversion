See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/MetricsVictoria/status/1375064484860067840).\r\n* FEATURE: add the following metrics at `/metrics` page for every VictoraMetrics app:\r\n  * `process_resident_memory_anon_bytes` - RSS share for memory allocated by the process itself.  This share cannot be freed by the OS, so it must be taken into account by OOM killer.\r\n  * `process_resident_memory_file_bytes` - RSS share for page cache memory (aka memory-mapped files). This share can be freed by the OS at any time, so it must be ignored by OOM killer.\r\n  * `process_resident_memory_shared_bytes` - RSS share for memory shared with other processes (aka shared memory). This share can be freed by the OS at any time, so it must be ignored by OOM killer.\r\n  * `process_resident_memory_peak_bytes` - peak RSS usage for the process.\r\n  * `process_virtual_memory_peak_bytes` - peak virtual memory usage for the process.\r\n* FEATURE: accept and enforce `extra_label=<label_name>=<label_value>` query arg at [Graphite APIs](https://victoriametrics.github.io/#graphite-api-usage).\r\n* FEATURE: use Influx field as metric name if measurement is empty and `-influxSkipSingleField` command-line is set. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1139).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `-promscrape.consul.waitTime` command-line flag for tuning the maximum wait time for Consul service discovery. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1144).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add `vm_promscrape_discovery_kubernetes_stale_resource_versions_total` metric for monitoring the frequency of `too old resource version` errors during Kubernetes service discovery.\r\n* FEATURE: single-node VictoriaMetrics: log metrics with timestamps older than `-search.cacheTimestampOffset` compared to the current time. See [these docs](https://victoriametrics.github.io/#backfilling) for details.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: prevent from infinite loop on `{__graphite__=\"...\"}` filters when a metric name contains `*`, `{` or `[` chars.\r\n* BUGFIX: prevent from infinite loop in `/metrics/find` and `/metrics/expand` [Graphite Metrics API handlers](https://victoriametrics.github.io/#graphite-metrics-api-usage) when they match metric names or labels with `*`, `{` or `[` chars.\r\n* BUGFIX: do not merge duplicate time series during requests to `/api/v1/query`. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1141\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: properly handle `too old resource version` error messages from Kubernetes watch API. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1150\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: do not retry sending data blocks if remote storage returns `400 Bad Request` error. The number of dropped blocks due to such errors can be monitored with `vmagent_remotewrite_packets_dropped_total` metrics. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1149\r\n* BUGFIX: properly calculate `summarize` and `*Series` functions in [Graphite Render API](https://victoriametrics.github.io/#graphite-render-api-usage).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2021-03-29T16:16:18Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.7.29", "html_url": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v1.7.29", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containous/traefik", "body": "- Update to go1.16 ([#7967](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/7967) by [ldez](https://github.com/ldez))\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-29T16:12:04Z", "project": "Traefik", "repo": "containous/traefik", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "5.2.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix/commit/798506596c60a62e6ee91c3e4df960ad6be1f628", "repo_url": "https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix", "body": "..........

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- Automatic deletion of old blocks with configurable per-tenant retention \r\n- Introduction of new storage options in Ruler and Alertmanager, using bucket client from Thanos. Previous storage options will be deprecated in next release.\r\n- New `thanosconvert` tool to migrate Thanos or Prometheus block metadata to Cortex\r\n- Support for `@ <timestamp>` in PromQL (needs to be enabled by flag)\r\n- Configurable per-tenant server-side encryption for S3\r\n- Work on sharding Alertmanager continues (not finished yet)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Don't expose cluster information to tenants via the `/alertmanager/api/v1/status` API endpoint when operating with clustering enabled. #3903\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: don't update internal \"last updated\" timestamp of TSDB if tenant only sends invalid samples. This affects how \"idle\" time is computed. #3727\r\n* [CHANGE] Require explicit flag `-<prefix>.tls-enabled` to enable TLS in GRPC clients. Previously it was enough to specify a TLS flag to enable TLS validation. #3156\r\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: removed `-querier.split-queries-by-day` (deprecated in Cortex 0.4.0). Please use `-querier.split-queries-by-interval` instead. #3813\r\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: the chunks pool controlled by `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-chunk-pool-bytes` is now shared across all tenants. #3830\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: return error code 400 instead of 429 when per-user/per-tenant series/metadata limits are reached. #3833\r\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: add `reason` label to `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total` metric. Source blocks marked for deletion by compactor are labelled as `compaction`, while blocks passing the retention period are labelled as `retention`. #3879\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the `DELETE /api/v1/alerts` is now idempotent. No error is returned if the alertmanager config doesn't exist. #3888\r\n* [FEATURE] Experimental Ruler Storage: Add a separate set of configuration options to configure the ruler storage backend under the `-ruler-storage.` flag prefix. All blocks storage bucket clients and the config service are currently supported. Clients using this implementation will only be enabled if the existing `-ruler.storage` flags are left unset. #3805 #3864\r\n* [FEATURE] Experimental Alertmanager Storage: Add a separate set of configuration options to configure the alertmanager storage backend under the `-alertmanager-storage.` flag prefix. All blocks storage bucket clients and the config service are currently supported. Clients using this implementation will only be enabled if the existing `-alertmanager.storage` flags are left unset. #3888\r\n* [FEATURE] Adds support to S3 server-side encryption using KMS. The S3 server-side encryption config can be overridden on a per-tenant basis for the blocks storage, ruler and alertmanager. Deprecated `-<prefix>.s3.sse-encryption`, please use the following CLI flags that have been added. #3651 #3810 #3811 #3870 #3886 #3906\r\n  - `-<prefix>.s3.sse.type`\r\n  - `-<prefix>.s3.sse.kms-key-id`\r\n  - `-<prefix>.s3.sse.kms-encryption-context`\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Enable `@ <timestamp>` modifier in PromQL using the new `-querier.at-modifier-enabled` flag. #3744\r\n* [FEATURE] Overrides Exporter: Add `overrides-exporter` module for exposing per-tenant resource limit overrides as metrics. It is not included in `all` target (single-binary mode), and must be explicitly enabled. #3785\r\n* [FEATURE] Experimental thanosconvert: introduce an experimental tool `thanosconvert` to migrate Thanos block metadata to Cortex metadata. #3770\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: It now shards the `/api/v1/alerts` API using the ring when sharding is enabled. #3671\r\n  * Added `-alertmanager.max-recv-msg-size` (defaults to 16M) to limit the size of HTTP request body handled by the alertmanager.\r\n  * New flags added for communication between alertmanagers:\r\n    * `-alertmanager.max-recv-msg-size`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.remote-timeout`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-enabled`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-cert-path`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-key-path`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-ca-path`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-server-name`\r\n    * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-insecure-skip-verify`\r\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: added blocks storage per-tenant retention support. This is configured via `-compactor.retention-period`, and can be overridden on a per-tenant basis. #3879\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Queries: Instrument queries that were discarded due to the configured `max_outstanding_requests_per_tenant`. #3894\r\n  * `cortex_query_frontend_discarded_requests_total`\r\n  * `cortex_query_scheduler_discarded_requests_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add TLS and explicit basis authentication configuration options for the HTTP client the ruler uses to communicate with the alertmanager. #3752\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.basic-auth-username`: Configure the basic authentication username used by the client. Takes precedent over a URL configured username.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.basic-auth-password`: Configure the basic authentication password used by the client. Takes precedent over a URL configured password.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-ca-path`: File path to the CA file.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-cert-path`: File path to the TLS certificate.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-insecure-skip-verify`: Boolean to disable verifying the certificate.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-key-path`: File path to the TLS key certificate.\r\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-server-name`: Expected name on the TLS certificate.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: exposed metric `cortex_ingester_oldest_unshipped_block_timestamp_seconds`, tracking the unix timestamp of the oldest TSDB block not shipped to the storage yet. #3705\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Prometheus upgraded. #3739 #3806\r\n  * Avoid unnecessary `runtime.GC()` during compactions.\r\n  * Prevent compaction loop in TSDB on data gap.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-Frontend now returns server side performance metrics using `Server-Timing` header when query stats is enabled. #3685\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runtime Config: Add a `mode` query parameter for the runtime config endpoint. `/runtime_config?mode=diff` now shows the YAML runtime configuration with all values that differ from the defaults. #3700\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Enable downstream projects to wrap distributor push function and access the deserialized write requests berfore/after they are pushed. #3755\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add flag `-<prefix>.tls-server-name` to require a specific server name instead of the hostname on the certificate. #3156\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Remove a tenant's alertmanager instead of pausing it as we determine it is no longer needed. #3722\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: added more configuration options to S3 client. #3775\r\n  * `-blocks-storage.s3.tls-handshake-timeout`: Maximum time to wait for a TLS handshake. 0 means no limit.\r\n  * `-blocks-storage.s3.expect-continue-timeout`: The time to wait for a server's first response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request has an Expect header. 0 to send the request body immediately.\r\n  * `-blocks-storage.s3.max-idle-connections`: Maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections across all hosts. 0 means no limit.\r\n  * `-blocks-storage.s3.max-idle-connections-per-host`: Maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections to keep per-host. If 0, a built-in default value is used.\r\n  * `-blocks-storage.s3.max-connections-per-host`: Maximum number of connections per host. 0 means no limit.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: when tenant's TSDB is closed, Ingester now removes pushed metrics-metadata from memory, and removes metadata (`cortex_ingester_memory_metadata`, `cortex_ingester_memory_metadata_created_total`, `cortex_ingester_memory_metadata_removed_total`) and validation metrics (`cortex_discarded_samples_total`, `cortex_discarded_metadata_total`). #3782\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: cleanup metrics for inactive tenants. #3784\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Have ingester to re-emit following TSDB metrics. #3800\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_blocks_loaded`\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_reloads_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_reloads_failures_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_symbol_table_size_bytes`\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_storage_blocks_bytes`\r\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_time_retentions_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: distribute workload across `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.replication-factor` store-gateway replicas when querying blocks and `-store-gateway.sharding-enabled=true`. #3824\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor / HA Tracker: added cleanup of unused elected HA replicas from KV store. Added following metrics to monitor this process: #3809\r\n  * `cortex_ha_tracker_replicas_cleanup_started_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ha_tracker_replicas_cleanup_marked_for_deletion_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ha_tracker_replicas_cleanup_deleted_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ha_tracker_replicas_cleanup_delete_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler now has new API endpoint `/ruler/delete_tenant_config` that can be used to delete all ruler groups for tenant. It is intended to be used by administrators who wish to clean up state after removed user. Note that this endpoint is enabled regardless of `-experimental.ruler.enable-api`. #3750 #3899\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend, query-scheduler: cleanup metrics for inactive tenants. #3826\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: added `-blocks-storage.s3.region` support to S3 client configuration. #3811\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Remove cached subrings for inactive users when using shuffle sharding. #3849\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Reduced memory used to fetch chunks at query time. #3855\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: attempt to prevent idle compaction from happening in concurrent ingesters by introducing a 25% jitter to the configured idle timeout (`-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-idle-timeout`). #3850\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: cleanup local files for users that are no longer owned by compactor. #3851\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: close empty bucket stores, and delete leftover local files for tenats that no longer belong to store-gateway. #3853\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added metrics to track partitioner behaviour. #3877\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_bytes_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_ranges_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_bytes_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_ranges_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added metrics to monitor chunk buffer pool behaviour. #3880\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_requested_bytes_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_returned_bytes_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: load alertmanager configurations from object storage concurrently, and only load necessary configurations, speeding configuration synchronization process and executing fewer \"GET object\" operations to the storage when sharding is enabled. #3898\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester (blocks storage): Ingester can now stream entire chunks instead of individual samples to the querier. At the moment this feature must be explicitly enabled either by using `-ingester.stream-chunks-when-using-blocks` flag or `ingester_stream_chunks_when_using_blocks` (boolean) field in runtime config file, but these configuration options are temporary and will be removed when feature is stable. #3889\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: New endpoint `/multitenant_alertmanager/delete_tenant_config` to delete configuration for tenant identified by `X-Scope-OrgID` header. This is an internal endpoint, available even if Alertmanager API is not enabled by using `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api`. #3900\r\n* [BUGFIX] Cortex: Fixed issue where fatal errors and various log messages where not logged. #3778\r\n* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker: don't track as error in the `cortex_kv_request_duration_seconds` metric a CAS operation intentionally aborted. #3745\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier / ruler: do not log \"error removing stale clients\" if the ring is empty. #3761\r\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: fixed a panic caused by a race condition when the index-header lazy loading is enabled. #3775 #3789\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed \"could not guess file size\" log when uploading blocks deletion marks to the global location. #3807\r\n* [BUGFIX] Prevent panic at start if the http_prefix setting doesn't have a valid value. #3796\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fixed panic caused by race condition in `armon/go-metrics` used by memberlist client. #3725\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: returning 422 (instead of 500) when query hits `max_chunks_per_query` limit with block storage. #3895\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Ensure that experimental `/api/v1/alerts` endpoints work when `-http.prefix` is empty. #3905\r\n* [BUGFIX] Chunk store: fix panic in inverted index when deleted fingerprint is no longer in the index. #3543\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-25T09:50:15Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.7.0", "tag_name": "v1.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/releases/tag/v1.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vault", "body": "## 1.7.0-rc1\n### 10 March 2021\n\nCHANGES:\n\n* go: Update go version to 1.15.8 [[GH-11060](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/11060)]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Aerospike Storage Backend**: Add support for using Aerospike as a storage backend [[GH-10131](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/10131)]\n* agent: Support for persisting the agent cache to disk [[GH-10938](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/10938)]\n* auth/jwt: Adds `max_age` role parameter and `auth_time` claim validation.

For complete details on how to upgrade your cStor operators, see https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/upgrade.md#cspc-pools.\r\n\r\n- The CRD API version has been updated for the cStor custom resources to v1. If you are upgrading via the helm chart, you might have to make sure that the new CRDs are updated. https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/tree/master/deploy/helm/charts/crds\r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- OpenEBS has applied for becoming a CNCF incubation project and is currently undergoing a Storage SIG review of the project and addressing the review comment provided. One of the significant efforts we are taking in this direction is to upstream the changes done in uZFS to OpenZFS. \r\n- Working on automating further Day 2 operations like -  automatically detecting a node deletion from the cluster, and re-balancing the volume replicas onto the next available node. \r\n- Migrating the CI pipelines from Travis to GitHub actions. \r\n- Several enhancements to the cStor Operators documentation with a lot of help from @survivant.\r\n- PSP support has been added to ZFS Local PV and cStor helm charts.\r\n- Improving the [OpenEBS Rawfile Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) in preparation for its beta release. In the current release, fixed some issues as well as added support for setting resource limits on the sidecar and few other optimizations.\r\n- Sample Grafana dashboards for managing OpenEBS are being developed here: https://github.com/openebs/charts/tree/gh-pages/grafana-charts\r\n\r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you [Armel Soro](https://github.com/rm3l), [Art Win](https://github.com/artw), @ssytnikov18 from [Verizon Media](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/adopters/verizon/README.md), [Mike T](https://github.com/mterhar),  [grouchojeff](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2719#issuecomment-794788971) for becoming a public reference and supporter of OpenEBS by sharing your use case on [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

The installation will involve creating a new Service Account and assigning it to OpenEBS components.\r\n- Make sure [iSCSI Initiator](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html) is installed on the Kubernetes nodes.\r\n- Node-Disk-Manager (NDM) helps in discovering the devices attached to Kubernetes nodes, which can be used to create storage pools. If you like to exclude some of the disks from getting discovered, update the filters in [NDM Config Map](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugndm.html) to exclude paths before installing OpenEBS.\r\n- NDM runs as a privileged pod since it needs to access the device information. Please make the necessary changes to grant access to run in privileged mode. For example, when running in RHEL/CentOS, you may need to set the security context appropriately. Refer [Configuring OpenEBS with selinux=on](https://blog.openebs.io/configuring-openebs-to-run-with-security-enhanced-linux-1e5a90a91da2)\r\n\r\n### Install using kubectl\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/2.7.0/openebs-operator.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install using Helm stable charts\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install --namespace openebs --name openebs openebs/openebs --version 2.7.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details refer to the documentation at https://docs.openebs.io/\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\nUpgrade to 2.7 is supported only from 1.0 or higher and follows a similar process as earlier releases. Detailed steps are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n- Upgrade OpenEBS Control Plane components.\r\n- Upgrade Jiva PVs to 2.7, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n- Upgrade CStor Pools to 2.7 and its associated Volumes, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n\r\nFor upgrading from releases prior to 1.0, please refer to the respective release upgrade [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n\r\n_Note: The community e2e pipelines verify upgrade testing only from non-deprecated releases (1.6 and higher) to 2.7. If you are running on release older than 1.6, OpenEBS recommends you upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible._ \r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf you are having issues in setting up or upgrade, you can contact:\r\n- OpenEBS Community for Support on [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io)\r\n    - Already signed up?

If you are using the cStor Storage Engine, please review the following before upgrading to this release.\r\n\r\n- The recommended approach for deploying cStor Pools is using the new custom resource called cStorPoolCluster (CSPC). Even though the provisioning of cStor Pools using StoragePoolClaim(SPC) is supported, it will be deprecated in future releases. The pools provisioned using SPC can be easily migrated to CSPC.  \r\n- When using cStor Pools, make sure that raw block devices are available on the nodes. If the block devices are formatted with a filesystem or mounted, then cStor Pool will not be created on the block device. In the current release, there are [manual steps](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/t-volume-provisioning.html#cstor-pool-pod-not-running) that could be followed to clear the filesystem or use partitions for creating cStor Pools, please reach out to the community (#openebs) at https://slack.k8s.io.\r\n- If you are using cStor pools with ephemeral devices, starting with 1.2 - upon node restart, cStor Pool will not be automatically re-created on the new devices. This check has been put to make sure that nodes are not accidentally restarted with new disks. The steps to recover from such a situation are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/maya/pull/1401#issue-308355304), which involves changing the status of the corresponding CSP to `Init`.\r\n- Capacity over-provisioning is enabled by default on the cStor pools. If you don\u2019t have alerts set up for monitoring the usage of the cStor pools, the pools can be fully utilized and the volumes can get into a read-only state. To avoid this, set up resource quotas as described in https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2855.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-16T07:34:15Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "pack v0.18.0", "tag_name": "v0.18.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/tag/v0.18.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack", "body": "# pack v0.18.0\r\n> This is a **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI.

[#31600](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31600)\r\n\r\n## Important\r\n\r\nThis release addresses a security vulnerability found in Rancher:\r\n\r\n- CVE-2021-25313 - XSS attack on the Rancher API - When accessing the Rancher API with a browser, the URL was not properly escaped, making it vulnerable to an XSS attack. Specially crafted URLs to these API endpoints could include JavaScript which would be embedded in the page and execute in a browser. There is no direct mitigation. Avoid clicking on untrusted links to your Rancher server. [#31583](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31583)\r\n\r\n- **Please review the [v2.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.4.0) for important updates/ breaking changes.**\r\n\r\n* **Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version [[#25117](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25117)]** - Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version. Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup.\r\n\r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper`.\r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied.\r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster.\r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Worker nodes are now upgraded in batches. Please refer to the [RKE documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/upgrades/maintaining-availability/) about how to upgrade clusters without downtime for applications.\r\n\r\n- **Restrict Kubernetes versions in Rancher helm chart to versions less than 1.20.0 [[#30746](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30746)]** - This restriction was added to prevent Rancher from being installed on incompatible versions of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n## Major Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.13\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where RKE clusters would get stuck when there were `Cordoned` worker nodes and starting to remove master nodes [#31271](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31271)  \r\n- Fixed an issue where monitoring was not working for windows server-core nodes [#31141](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31141)\r\n- Fixed an issue where telemetry client had a socket leak and cause upgrade issues or general k8s issues [#28360](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28360)\r\n\r\n### Air Gap Installations and Upgrades\r\n\r\nIn v2.4.0, an air gap installation no longer requires mirroring the systems chart git repo. Please follow the directions on how to [install Rancher to use the packaged systems chart](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap/install-rancher).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]\r\n- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\"API Server Request Rate\"_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]\r\n- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue.

Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components.  Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see [the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n\r\n**Important:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-13T06:06:34Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.5.0", "tag_name": "v1.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.5.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk", "body": "## v1.5.0\r\n\r\nThis release contains a few big changes, one of which is the stabilization of project version `3-alpha` to `3`.

([#4514](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4514))\r\n- (ansible/v1, helm/v1) Upgraded the `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy` image version from `0.5.0` to `0.8.0` to support rootless run mode. ([#4498](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4498))\r\n- For Ansible/Helm-based operators, fix swapped readinessProbe/livenessProbe in manager.

Authored by @[cogwirrel](https://github.com/cogwirrel), [#3210](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3210).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Remove soon-to-be deprecated `any` and `all` from the [Policy Reference](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.27.1/policy-reference/#aggregates) ([#3241](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3241)) -- see also [#2437](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2437).\r\n- Add missing `discovery.service` field to [Discovery configuration](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.27.1/configuration/#discovery) table ([#3237](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3237)).\r\n- Fix dead links to the Envoy pages ([#3248](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3248)).\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\n- Executions using the internal Wasm SDK will now be interrupted when the provided context is done (cancelled or deadline reached).\r\n- The generated Wasm modules could become much smaller: unused functions are replaced by `unreachable` stubs, and the heavyweight runtime components related to regular expressions are excluded when none of the regex-related builtins are used: `glob.match`, `regex.is_valid`, `regex.match`, `regex.is_valid`, and `regex.find_all_string_submatch_n`.\r\n- The Wasm runtime now allows passing in the time to be used for evaluation, enabling callers to control the time-of-day observed by Wasm compiled policies.\r\n- Wasmtime runtime has been updated to the latest version (v0.24.0).", "created_at": "2021-03-12T14:30:26Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.1.2", "tag_name": "v1.1.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.1.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "This patch release includes some bug fixes for Chaos Dashboard and NetworkChaos.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements \r\n* Adds helm parameter to annotate dashboard service #1443 \r\n* Makefile: adds options to build images on ARM platform #1553\r\n* Chaos Dashboard\r\n  * Supports set `GracePeriod` field when creating `PodChaos` in Dashboard #1471\r\n  * Changes stress workers\u2019 default value to zero when creating StressChaos in Dashboard #1524 \r\n  * Now the LabelField will submit a label automatically when losing the focus on the text field #1563\r\n\r\n## Fixes \r\n* Chaos Dashboard \r\n  * Fixed bugs when creating `StressChaos` in Dashboard #1471\r\n  * Fixed a few problems related to the interface #1501\r\n  * Validates selector authority in admission webhook #1560\r\n* Chaos Daemon: Docker client returns an error if the `pid` is zero #1445\r\n* Fixed the state of chaos experiment when creating a `pod-kill` action #1479\r\n* Fixed the issue where  `NetworChaos` may not work normally when the Linux kernel is less than 3.12  #1456\r\n* Fixed the issue `both` direction didn\u2019t work normally when the target and external targets are both empty #1511\r\n* Fixed the issue where chaos experiment would directly start when it got applied, even if the `cron` is not configured so  #1518\r\n* Fixed meaningless retry operations caused by updates of the statue field #1549\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-12T13:44:29Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.1.1", "tag_name": "1.1.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/1.1.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kuma", "body": "This patch release adds features and fixes issues in the previous release, 1.1.0:\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* zipkin config now includes a shared span context option [#1660](https://github.com//kumahq/kuma/pull/1660)\r\n :+1: contributed by @ericmustin\r\n* `changed` check was removed [#1663](https://github.com//kumahq/kuma/pull/1663)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* All types are now enumerated in kumactl [#1673](https://github.com//kumahq/kuma/pull/1673)\r\n* Annnotations are appropriately applied to all services with ingress (fixes an issue with ingress services without annotations) [#1671](https://github.com//kumahq/kuma/pull/1671)\r\n* Error message improved for the case where $HOME is not defined [#1664](https://github.com//kumahq/kuma/pull/1664)\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Notably, instead of `ResponseMap()`\n  and `ResponseBody()`, resources simply expose `Response()`. This higher-level\n  response object contains the map and body, and also exposes `StatusCode()` in\n  place of indivdidual resources.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962)\n* cli: In `json` output format, a resource item is now an object under the\n  top-level key `item`; a list of resource items is now an list of objects under\n  the top-level key `items`. This preserves the top level for putting in other\n  useful information later on (and the HTTP status code is included now).\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962)\n* cli: In `json` output format, errors are now serialized as a JSON object with\n  an `error` key instead of outputting normal text\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962)\n* cli: All errors, including API errors, are now written to `stderr`. Previously\n  in the default table format, API errors would be written to `stdout`.\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962)\n* cli: Error return codes have been standardized across CLI commands. An error\n  code of `1` indicates an error generated from the actual controller API; an\n  error code of `2` is an error encountered due to the CLI command's logic; and\n  an error code of `3` indicates an error that was caused due to user input to\n  the command. (There is some nuance sometimes whether an error is really due to\n  user input or not, but we attempt to be consistent.)\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/976)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* list filtering: Listing now supports filtering results before being returned\n  to the user. The filtering takes place server side and uses boolean\n  expressions against the JSON representation of returned items. See [the\n  documentation](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing)\n  for more details. ([PR 1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/952))\n  ([PR 2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/957))\n  ([PR 3](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/967))\n* server: Officially support reloading TLS parameters on `SIGHUP`. (This likely\n  worked before but wasn't fully tested.)\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/959))\n* server: On `SIGHUP`, [worker\n  tags](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/configuration/worker#tags) will be\n  re-parsed and new values used\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/959))\n* server: In addition to the existing `tls_min_version` listener configuration\n  value, `tls_max_version` is now supported. This should generally be left blank\n  but can be useful for situations where e.g. a load balancer has broken TLS 1.3\n  support, or does not support TLS 1.3 and flags it as a disallowed value.", "created_at": "2021-03-10T16:09:36Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.5.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/commits/16d765db7e64d504bfe3d1570352f5226beb4924", "repo_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet", "body": "Merge pull request #8536 from GabrielNagy/revert-PUP-10853/remove-legacy-facts\n\nRevert \"Merge pull request #8492 from GabrielNagy/PUP-10853/remove-le\u2026", "created_at": "2021-03-10T09:55:02Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.22.0 \"Balinese Zero\"", "tag_name": "v0.22.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.22.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 Stop API conversion spam and Disable webhook PodDisruptionBudget\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.22.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.22.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.22.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.22.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.22.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Deprecation Notices\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n* :bug: Serialize and deserialize Finally in PipelineRuns too (#3816)\r\n\r\nFix issue where PipelineRun with finally in nested pipeline spec would lose those finally tasks when converted down to v1alpha1 and back up to v1beta1 again.\r\n\r\n* :bug: Change to avoid error when service account has empty secret name (#3795)\r\n\r\nIn case of an empty secret name, the taskRun was failing with CouldntGetTask as the GET request with an empty secret name return an error saying resource name may not be empty.

This keeps the message up with the settings used in modern Erlang releases.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2854](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2854)\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Community-maintained [RabbitMQ OCF scripts](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/scripts/rabbitmq-server-ha.ocf) were revisited.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by Michele @mbaldessari Baldessari.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2853](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2853)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n There were no dependency changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.8.14.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-02T15:54:36Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "6.2.1", "tag_name": "6.2.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/antirez/redis", "body": "Upgrade urgency: LOW.\r\n\r\nHere is a comprehensive list of changes in this release compared to 6.2.0,\r\neach one includes the PR number that added it, so you can get more details\r\nat https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/<number>\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Fix sanitize-dump-payload for stream with deleted records (#8568)\r\n* Prevent client-query-buffer-limit config from being set to lower than 1mb (#8557)\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n* Make port, tls-port and bind config options modifiable at runtime (#8510)\r\n\r\nPlatform and deployment-related changes:\r\n* Fix compilation error on non-glibc systems if jemalloc is not used (#8533)\r\n* Improved memory consumption and memory usage tracking on FreeBSD (#8545)\r\n* Fix compilation on ARM64 MacOS with jemalloc (#8458)\r\n\r\nModules:\r\n* New Module API for getting user name of a client (#8508)\r\n* Optimize RM_Call by utilizing a shared reusable client (#8516)\r\n* Fix crash running CLIENT INFO via RM_Call (#8560)\r\n", "created_at": "2021-03-02T06:14:39Z", "project": "Redis", "repo": "antirez/redis", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Contour v1.13.1", "tag_name": "v1.13.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.13.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour", "body": "## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- #3410: fixes an issue where global rate limit policies defined at the virtual host level for TLS-secured `HTTPProxies` were being ignored\r\n- #3412: fixes an issue where changes to the Envoy load balancer address were not immediately being reflected in `HTTPProxies'` status.\r\n- #3417: updates Envoy from v1.17.0 to v1.17.1.

In order to export the config on cluster update, you need to either add the `--user <user>` to reference an existing user, or `--admin` to export the cluster admin user. If neither flag is passed, the kubernetes config will not be modified. This makes it easier to reuse user definitions across clusters should you, for example, use OIDC for authentication.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `kops export kubecfg` will also require passing either the `--admin` or `--user` flag if the context does not already exist.\r\n\r\nBy default, the credentials of any exported admin user now have a lifetime of 18 hours. The lifetime of the exported\r\ncredentials may be specified as a value of the `--admin` flag. To get the previous behavior, specify `--admin=87600h` to either `kops update cluster` or `kops export kubecfg`.\r\n\r\n`kops create cluster --yes` exports the admin user along with rest of the cluster config, as was the previous behaviour (except for the 18-hour validity).\r\n\r\n## ARM64 support\r\n\r\nkOps will install ARM64 artifacts and containerd images when the instance group supports ARM64 for both machine type and OS image. At the moment this is known to work with AWS m6g, c6g, r6g and t4g instances, with the latest Ubuntu 20.04 OS images for ARM64.\r\n\r\n## OpenStack Cinder plugin\r\n\r\nkOps will install the Cinder plugin for kOps running kubernetes 1.16 or newer. If you already have this plugin installed you should remove it before upgrading.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a default `StorageClass`, you should set `cloudConfig.Openstack.BlockStorage.CreateStorageClass: false` to prevent kOps from installing one.\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes by kind\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n* New clusters will now have one nodes group per zone. The number of nodes now defaults to the number of zones.\r\n\r\n* On AWS kOps now defaults to using launch templates instead of launch configurations.\r\n\r\n* There is now Alpha support for Hashicorp Vault as a store for secrets and keys. See the [Vault state store docs](/state/#vault-vault).\r\n\r\n* The lifetimes of certificates used by various components have been substantially reduced.\r\nThe certificates on a node will expire sometime between 455 and 485 days after the node's creation.\r\nThe expiration times vary randomly so that nodes are likely to have their certs expire at different times than other nodes.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports using an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) for API access.\r\nSee the [documentation](/cluster_spec/#load-balancer-class) for more info.\r\n\r\n* Allow users to partially compress user-data, check the instance groups docs for more details.\r\n\r\n* Worker nodes on AWS will now be bootstrapped using kops-controller.\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n* The `kops update cluster` command will now refuse to run on a cluster that\r\nhas been updated by a newer version of kOps unless it is given the `--allow-kops-downgrade` flag.\r\n\r\n* New command for deleting a single instance: [kops delete instance](/docs/cli/kops_delete_instance/)\r\n\r\n### CNI\r\n\r\n* Clusters using the Amazon VPC CNI provider now perform an `ec2.DescribeInstanceTypes` call at instance launch time. In large clusters or AWS accounts this may lead to API throttling which could delay node readiness. If this becomes a problem please open a GitHub issue.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico with `CrossSubnet` enabled will switch to the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) for disabling the [AWS source/destination checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck). The previous implementation using [k8s-ec2-srcdst](https://github.com/ottoyiu/k8s-ec2-srcdst) is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now enable the [eBPF dataplane](https://docs.projectcalico.org/about/about-ebpf) mode for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.bpfEnabled: true` and `spec.kubeProxy.enabled: false` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now encrypt pod-to-pod traffic with [WireGuard](https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic) for Ubuntu hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.wireguardEnabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Cilium now enable BPF NodePort by default if the Kubernetes version is 1.12 or newer.\r\n\r\n### Addons\r\n\r\n* Metrics Server is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.metricsServer.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cluster Autoscaler is now availalble as a configurable addon. Add `spec.clusterAutoscaler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* AWS Node Termination Handler is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.nodeTerminationHandler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cilium will enable `enable-remote-identity` by default. This can affect network policies. If you want to keep old behaviour, add `spec.networking.cilium.enableRemoteIdentity: false` in your cluster spec.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes 1.9 and 1.10 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions has been removed. This removal may be temporarily deferred to kOps 1.20 by setting the `LegacyIAM` feature flag.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* See note about [Openstack Cinder plugin](#openstack-cinder-plugin) above.\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS, in order to prevent downtime you will have to remove the state of any existing ELB or TargetGroup attachments from your Terraform state file. This is due to migrating the attachments to the in-line `aws_autoscaling_group` fields. See the [terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group) for more information about the difference. This migration is required due to a bug described in [#9913](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9913).\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_autoscaling_attachment | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS migrating clusters from Launch Configurations to Launch Templates may need to remove the state of the old Launch Configuration. This is due to potential errors with Terraform attempting to delete the Launch Configuration before updating the AutoScalingGroup to use the Launch Template. The Launch Configurations will need to be manually deleted afterwards.\r\n  More information including detailed remediation steps is available in [#10017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/10017).\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_launch_configuration | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure launch configurations are not being destroyed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename their EBS Volume resources to match 0.12's stricter naming requirements. Volumes whose Terraform resource name begin with a digit are now prefixed with `ebs-`. This change will be made regardless of `Terraform-0.12` feature flag value. More information is available in [#9982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9982).\r\n  When upgrading to kOps 1.19, follow these steps to determine if a rename is necessary:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Look for any EBS volumes being recreated\r\n  # Adjust these arguments as necessary\r\n  terraform state mv aws_ebs_volume.1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local aws_ebs_volume.ebs-1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Confirm no EBS volumes being changed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If you are using Terraform with an additional .tf file and using \"aws_autoscaling_attachment\" to attach additional Load Balancers or ALB/NLB Target Groups you'll need to migrate to [attaching them through the InstanceGroup spec instead](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#externalloadbalancers).\r\n\r\n* AWS clusters using an ACM Certificate on the API ELB (`.spec.api.loadBalancer.sslCertificateID`) will need to migrate from Classic LoadBalancer (CLB) to Network LoadBalancer (NLB) prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19 by setting `.spec.api.loadBalancer.class: Network`.\r\n  Any kubeconfig files using kOps' admin client credentials will need to be regenerated with `kops export kubecfg --admin`.\r\n  For more information see [this page](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/permalinks/acm_nlb.md).\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.11 and 1.12 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker container runtime has been deprecated and will be replaced with containerd for new clusters as of kOps 1.20. For existing clusters the default behaviour can be overridden by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd` in the cluster spec. This change closely tracks the upstream [deprecation of Docker](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker).\r\n\r\n* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20. All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The experimental node authorizor is now ignored if you are using kubernetes 1.19.

been downgraded to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to not clutter terminal output.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `Created` field of `podman ps --format=json` was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) ([#9315](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9315)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the `podman images` command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `--cgroups=split` did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail ([#9393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9393)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume ([#9415](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/9415)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the `--entrypoint=[\"\"]` option to `podman run` and `podman create` as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored ([#9377](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9377)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would set the `HOME` environment variable to `\"\"` when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory ([#9378](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9378)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause `podman pod create` to panic ([#9374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9374)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--runtime` option was not properly handled by the `podman build` command ([#9365](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9365)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed ([#9387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9387)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would incorrectly escape `%t` when generating the path for the PID file ([#9373](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9373)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, when run inside a Podman container with the host's containers/storage directory mounted into the container, erroneously detect a reboot and reset container state if the temporary directory was not also mounted in ([#9191](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9191)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some options of the `podman build` command (including but not limited to `--jobs`) were nonfunctional ([#9247](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9247)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a breaking change to the Libpod Wait API for Containers where the Conditions parameter changed type in Podman v3.0 ([#9351](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9351)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle forwarded ports that did not specify a host port.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Wait endpoint for Containers could write duplicate headers after an error occurred.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Images would not pull images that already had a matching tag present locally, even if a more recent version was available at the registry ([#9232](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9232)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the `docker-java` library.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.19.4\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-18T20:16:12Z", "project": "Podman", "repo":

Hints are an opaque data structure that can be used to carry additional information from the store and its content is implementation-specific.\r\n- [#3421](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3421) Tools: Added `thanos tools bucket rewrite` command allowing to delete series from given block.\r\n- [#3509](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3509) Store: Added a CLI flag to limit the number of series that are touched.\r\n- [#3444](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3444) Query Frontend: Make POST request to downstream URL for labels and series API endpoints.\r\n- [#3388](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3388) Tools: Bucket replicator now can specify block IDs to copy.\r\n- [#3385](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3385) Tools: Bucket prints extra statistics for block index with debug log-level.\r\n- [#3121](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3121) Receive: Added `--receive.hashrings` alternative to `receive.hashrings-file` flag (lower priority). The flag expects the literal hashring configuration in JSON format.\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- [#3567](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3567) Mixin: Reintroduce `thanos_objstore_bucket_operation_failures_total` alert.\r\n- [#3527](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3527) Query Frontend: Fix query_range behavior when start/end times are the same\r\n- [#3560](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3560) Query Frontend: Allow separate label cache\r\n- [#3672](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3672) Rule: Prevent crashing due to `no such host error` when using `dnssrv+` or `dnssrvnoa+`.\r\n- [#3461](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3461) Compact, Shipper, Store: Fixed panic when no external labels are set in block metadata.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [#3496](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3496) S3: Respect SignatureV2 flag for all credential providers.\r\n- [#2732](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2732) Swift: Switched to a new library [ncw/swift](https://github.com/ncw/swift) providing large objects support.\r\n   By default, segments will be uploaded to the same container directory `segments/` if the file is bigger than `1GB`.\r\n   To change the defaults see [the docs](./docs/storage.md#openstack-swift).\r\n- [#3626](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3626) Shipper: Failed upload of `meta.json` file doesn't cause block cleanup anymore. This has a potential to generate corrupted blocks under specific conditions. Partial block is left in bucket for later cleanup.", "created_at": "2021-01-27T11:25:36Z", "project": "Thanos", "repo": "thanos-io/thanos", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess 9.0.0", "tag_name": "v9.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v9.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "This release complies with VEP-3 which removes the upgrade order requirement. Components can be upgraded in any order. It is recommended that the upgrade order should still be followed if possible, except to canary test the new version of VTGate before upgrading the rest of the components.\r\n\r\n## Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\nThe following PRs made changes to behaviors that clients might rely on. They should be reviewed carefully so that client code can be changed in concert with a Vitess release deployment.\r\n* The update to golang 1.15 (#7204) might break systems that use TLS certificates with a common name. A fix is documented here (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40748#issuecomment-673612108)\r\n\r\nVitess 9.0 is not compatible with the previous release of the Vitess Kubernetes Operator (2.2.0).

There are [some system variables](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/master/go/vt/sysvars/sysvars.go#L147,L190) which are disabled by default and can be enabled using flag `-enable_system_settings` on VTGate. These system variables are set on the mysql server. Because they change the mysql session, using them leads to the Vitess connection no longer using the connection pool and forcing dedicated connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n### VReplication\r\n\r\n* VReplication: refactored and enhanced support for JSON columns #6829\r\n* VReplication: Don't update tx timestamp on heartbeat #6930\r\n* VReplication E2E Tests: Refactored tests for readability and attempting to fix flakiness #6991\r\n* VRepl/Tablet Picker: improve observability of selected tablet #6999\r\n* VReplication: Handle comment statement type in vstreamer #7092\r\n* VReplication e2e: Fine tuned test to reduce flakiness and added more logging to debug future flakiness #7138\r\n* VReplication: Make relay log size & rows configurable. #6992\r\n* VReplication: New workflows cli UX.

maintain the project.\r\nA huge thank you to them for their existing contributions and for stepping up here :heart:\r\n- Rewritten and revamped contributor guide https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/getting-started/\r\n\r\nAdditionally we're trying a new approach to tracking [priorities for v0.11.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2024) which you can see in our issue tracker.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we've made a number of bug fixes and minor improvements.\r\n\r\nSome users may appreciate the ability to run kind v0.10.0 (NOT the currently installed v0.7.0) in the free [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) for quick demos, workshops, etc.\r\n\r\nSimply install kind somewhere under $HOME and add it to your $PATH to use it in cloud shell:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGO111MODULE=on go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.10.0\r\nexport PATH=\"$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}\"\r\nkind create cluster\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo persist this `PATH` for future usage you can edit your `$HOME/.bashrc` in cloudshell.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.20.2` image:

still encompases `v1.13.0` for now.\r\n- Images from KIND `v0.8.0+` should continue to work for now, but lack various improvements.\r\n- udev is explicitly disabled at the node level, though as always please try not to depend on the inner details of nodes beyond providing a particular Kubernetes version with kind\r\n- IPv6 pod subnet defaults to /56 instead of /64 (a necessary fix for newer Kubernetes, see #1903)\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- `kind export logs` now includes the kind version\r\n- Node images compiled without dockershim for Kubernetes v1.19+ possible, reducing size\r\n- Reduced kind binary size further (~7MB) with improved build options\r\n- Improved zsh completion\r\n- Experimental github actions CI for podman, docker, cgroupsv2\r\n- Expanded WSL2 documentation\r\n- Revamped contributor guide\r\n- Improved docs site implementation, including table of contents generation\r\n- Updated dependencies\r\n- New Loadbalancer user guide\r\n- Better support for running in nested container environments when using images built with v0.10.0+\r\n  - This enables cloud shell support\r\n\r\nNew Node images have been built for kind `v0.10.0`, please use these **exact** images (IE like `v1.20.2:@sha256:8f7ea6e7642c0da54f04a7ee10431549c0257315b3a634f6ef2fecaaedb19bab` including the digest) or build your own as we may need to

"v1.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.1.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "# Highlights\r\n1. Native RWX support (experimental)\r\n    1. See [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/) for documentation.\r\n1. ARM64 support (experimental)\r\n    1. Longhorn now supports ARM64 architecture in addition to AMD64. You can deploy Longhorn as usual in ARM64 without any modification.\r\n1. [CSI Snapshotter support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/)\r\n    1. CSI Snapshotter is a new beta feature since Kubernetes v1.17. It allows users to create snapshots for volumes directly using the `kubectl` command. In Longhorn's context, those `CSI snapshots` will be mapped into `backups`. So after we add the support, Longhorn users will be able to create/restore backups for the volumes without using the Longhorn UI.\r\n1. [Prometheus support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/monitoring/)\r\n    1. We've added Prometheus endpoints and an example Grafana dashboard.\r\n    1. Now the users can easily use the existing monitoring solution to collect stats about the Longhorn, as well as set up alerts for certain situations.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n1. Enhanced failure recovery during Kubernetes node failure\r\n    1. [Automatic recovery for the StatefulSets](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/node-failure/#pod-deletion-policy-when-node-is-down).\r\n    1. [Improved recovery mechanism for volume failure](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/recover-volume/).\r\n    1. Rebuild based on existing replica after the node temporarily disconnected.\r\n1. [Better node maintenance support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/volumes-and-nodes/maintenance/)\r\n    1. Automatically remove node when the node has been removed from Kubernetes.\r\n    1. Automatically recognized the existing disk on another node (e.g. reattached EBS on a different EC2 instance).\r\n    1. Support Kubernetes `drain`.\r\n    1. Support manually pause replica rebuild for server maintenance.\r\n    1. Support replica eviction for the nodes/disks.\r\n1. Support [`Data Locality` option](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/data-locality/) to always keep a replica local to the engine.\r\n    1. The data locality feature will always try to keep a replica local to the workload, which guarantees even when the network interruption happens, the volume will continue working for the local workload.\r\n1. [Allow volume creation with degraded availability](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/references/settings/#allow-volume-creation-with-degraded-availability)\r\n    1. If the value is **true**, Longhorn will not prevent the volume creation as long as there is at least one replica has been scheduled successfully. It will help users with less than 3 nodes environment. Longhorn will automatically start rebuilding replicas if more available space on other nodes is found later.\r\n    1. The default value is **true**. Recommend value for **the production environment: false**.\r\n1. Improvement performance via removing revision counter (experimental).\r\n\r\n# Release note\r\n1. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn v1.1.0 is **v1.16**.\r\n2. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn with CSI Snapshotter is **v1.17**.\r\n    1. Please follow the instruction [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/) to install the CSI Snapshot Controller in your Kubernetes cluster if you want to use the CSI snapshot feature. \r\n1. Experimental features:\r\n    1. For the experimental features in this release, we will continue working on improving them. We don't recommend using the experimental features in production.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade\r\nLive upgrade from v1.0.x is supported.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
