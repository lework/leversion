Importantly, this release includes a notable change to built-in function error handling. See the section below for details.\r\n\r\n### Built-in Function Error Handling\r\n\r\nPreviously, built-in function errors would cause policy evaluation to halt immediately. Going forward, by default, built-in function errors no longer halt evaluation. Instead, expressions are treated as false/undefined if any of the invoked built-in functions return errors.\r\n\r\nThis change resolves a common issue people face when passing unsanitized input values to built-in functions. For example, prior to this change the expression `io.jwt.decode(\"GARBAGE\")` would halt evaluation of the entire policy because the string is not a valid encoding of a JSON Web Token (JWT). If the expression was `io.jwt.decode(input.token)` and the user passed an invalid string value for `input.token` the same error would occur. With this change, the same expression is simply undefined, i.e., there is no result. This means policies can use negation to test for invalid values. For example:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\ndecision := {\"allowed\": allow, \"denial_reason\": reason}\r\n\r\ndefault allow = false\r\n\r\nallow {\r\n  io.jwt.verify_hs256(input.token, \"secret\")\r\n  [_, payload, _] := io.jwt.decode(input.token)\r\n  payload.role == \"admin\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nreason[\"invalid JWT supplied as input\"] {\r\n  not io.jwt.decode(input.token)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you require the old behaviour, enable \"strict\" built-in errors on the query:\r\n\r\n| Caller | Example |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| HTTP | `POST /v1/data/example/allow?strict-builtin-errors` |\r\n| Go (Library) | `rego.New(rego.Query(\"data.example.allow\"), rego.StrictBuiltinErrors(true))` |\r\n| CLI | `opa eval --strict-builtin-errors 'data.example.allow'` |\r\n\r\nIf you have implemented custom built-in functions and require policy evaluation to halt on error in those built-in functions, modify your built-in functions to return the [topdown.Halt](./topdown/errors.go) error type.\r\n\r\n### Built-in Functions\r\n\r\nThis release includes a few new built-in functions:\r\n\r\n- `base64url.encode_no_pad`, `hex.encode`, and `hex.decode` for dealing with encoded data ([#2849](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2849)) authored by @[johanneslarsson](https://github.com/johanneslarsson)\r\n- `json.patch` for applying JSON patches to values inside of policies ([#2839](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2839)) authored by @[jaspervdj-luminal](https://github.com/jaspervdj-luminal)\r\n- `json.is_valid` and `yaml.is_valid` for testing validity of encoded values (authored by @[jaspervdj-luminal](https://github.com/jaspervdj-luminal))\r\n\r\nThere were also a few fixes to existing built-in functions:\r\n\r\n- Fix unicode handling in a few string-related functions ([#2799](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2799)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n- Fix `http.send` to override `no-cache` HTTP header when `force_cache` specified ([#2841](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2841)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n- Fix `strings.replace_n` to replace overlapping patterns deterministically ([#2822](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2822))\r\n- Fix panic in `units.parse_bytes` when passed a zero-length string ([#2901](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2901))\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThis release adds new credential providers for management services:\r\n\r\n- GCP metadata server ([#2938](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/2938)) authored by @[kelseyhightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower)\r\n- AWS Web Identity credentials ([#2462](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/2725)) authored by @[RichiCoder1](https://github.com/RichiCoder1)\r\n- OAuth2 ([#1205](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1205)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n\r\nIn addition the following server features were added:\r\n\r\n- Add shutdown wait period flag to `opa run` (`--shutdown-wait-period`) ([#2764](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2764)) authored by @[bcarlsson](https://github.com/bcarlsson)\r\n- Add bundle file size limit configuration option (`bundles[_].size_limit_bytes`) to override default 1GiB limit ([#2781](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2781))\r\n- Separate decision log and status message logs from access logs (which useful for running OPA at log level `error` while continuing to report decision and status log to console) ([#2733](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2733)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix panic caused by race condition in the decision logger ([#2835](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/2948)) authored by @[kubaj](https://github.com/kubaj)\r\n- Fix decision logger to flush on graceful shutdown ([#780](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/780)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n- Fix `--verification-key` handling to accept PEM files ([#2796](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2796))\r\n- Fix `--capabilities` flag in `opa build` command ([#2848](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2848)) authored by @[srenatus](https://github.com/srenatus)\r\n- Fix loading of **signed** persisted bundles ([#2824](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2824))\r\n- Fix API response mutation caused by decision log masking ([#2752](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2752)) authored by @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11)\r\n- Fix evaluator to prevent `with` statements from mutating original `input` document ([#2813](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2813))\r\n- Fix set iteration runtime to be O(n) instead of O(n^2) ([#2966](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/2966))\r\n- Increased OPA version telemetry report timeout from 1 second to 5 seconds to deal with slow networks\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Improve docs to mention built-in function support in WebAssembly compiled policies\r\n- Improve docs around JWT HMAC encoding ([#2870](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2870)) authored by @[anderseknert](https://github.com/anderseknert)\r\n- Improve HTTP authorization tutorial steps for zsh ([#2917](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2917) authored by @[ClaudenirFreitas](https://github.com/ClaudenirFreitas))\r\n- Improve docs to describe meaning of Prometheus metrics\r\n- Remove mention of unsafe (and unsupported) \"none\" signature algorithm from JWT documentation\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\nThis release also includes a number of improvements to the Wasm support in OPA. Importantly, OPA now integrates a Wasm runtime that can be used to execute Wasm compiled policies. The runtime is integrated into the existing \"topdown\" evaluator so that specific portions of the policy can be compiled to Wasm as a performance optimization. When the evaluator executes a policy using the Wasm runtime it emits a special `Wasm` trace event. The Wasm runtime support in OPA is currently considered **experimental** and will be iterated on in coming releases.\r\n\r\nThis release also extends the Wasm compiler in OPA to natively support the following built-in functions (in alphabetical order):\r\n\r\n* `base64.encode`, `base64.decode`, `base64url.encode`, and `base64url.decode`\r\n* `glob.match`\r\n* `json.marshal` and `json.unmarshal`\r\n* `net.cidr_contains`, `net.cidr_intersects`, and `net.cidr_overlap`\r\n* `regex.match`, `regex.is_valid`, and `regex.find_all_string_submatch_n`\r\n* `to_number`\r\n* `walk`\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- The `--insecure-addr` flag (which was deprecated in v0.10.0) has been removed completely ([#763](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/763))", "created_at": "2020-12-03T19:16:27Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.0.0-rc1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/nomad/commits/6ed0ac873f29914351b92b8e0cf2536789225f97", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad", "body": "Release v1.0.0-rc1", "created_at": "2020-12-03T18:26:48Z", "project": "Nomad", "repo": "hashicorp/nomad", "type": "Orchestration", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.0.16", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/theupdateframework/specification/commits/fd85a8a12403435d84e202ea8790eb4abad4559d", "repo_url": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification", "body": "Merge pull request #136 from joshuagl/joshuagl/fix-fixed-time\n\nFix freeze attack checks after the introduction of workflow maximum duration (by removing workflow maximum duration?)", "created_at": "2020-12-03T17:05:55Z", "project": "TUF", "repo": "theupdateframework/specification", "type": "Software Update", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.4.0", "tag_name": "v0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases/tag/v0.4.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/grafana/tempo", "body": "0.4.0 Release of Tempo with lots of bugfixes and performance improvements! \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\nThis release saw three new contributors, welcome to the project  @achatterjee-grafana, @AlexisSellier and @simonswine!\r\n\r\n## [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\ncd8e6cbd Add level label to tempodb_compaction_objects_combined_total metric.

([#26524](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26524))\n\n    If you wish to retain the previous behavior of always taking the newest version allowed by the version constraints on each install, you can run `terraform init -upgrade` to see that behavior.\n\n* Terraform will now support reading and writing all compatible state files, even from future versions of Terraform. This means that users of Terraform 0.14.0 will be able to share state files with future Terraform versions until a new state file format version is needed. We have no plans to change the state file format at this time. ([#26752](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26752))\n\nUPGRADE NOTES:\n* Outputs that reference sensitive values (which includes variables marked as sensitive, other module outputs marked as `sensitive`, or attributes a provider defines as `sensitive` if the `provider_sensitive_attrs` experiment is activated) must _also_ be defined as sensitive, or Terraform will error at plan.\n* The `version` argument inside provider configuration blocks has been documented as deprecated since Terraform 0.12. As of 0.14 it will now also generate an explicit deprecation warning. To avoid the warning, use [provider requirements](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/provider-requirements.html) declarations instead. ([#26135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26135))\n* The official MacOS builds of Terraform now require MacOS 10.12 Sierra or later. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n* TLS certificate verification for outbound HTTPS requests from Terraform CLI no longer treats the certificate's \"common name\" as a valid hostname when the certificate lacks any \"subject alternative name\" entries for the hostname. TLS server certificates must list their hostnames as a \"DNS name\" in the subject alternative names field. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n* Outbound HTTPS requests from Terraform CLI now enforce [RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)'s client-side downgrade protection checks. This should not significantly affect normal operation, but may result in connection errors in environments where outgoing requests are forced through proxy servers and other \"middleboxes\", if they have behavior that resembles a downgrade attack. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n* Terraform's HTTP client code is now slightly stricter than before in HTTP header parsing, but in ways that should not affect typical server implementations: Terraform now trims only _ASCII_ whitespace characters, and does not allow `Transfer-Encoding: identity`. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n* The `terraform 0.13upgrade` subcommand and the associated upgrade mechanisms are no longer available. Complete the v0.13 upgrade process before upgrading to Terraform v0.14.\n* The `debug` command, which did not offer additional functionality, has been removed.\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n* config: Added `sensitive` argument for variable blocks, which supresses output where that variable is used ([#26183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/26183))\n* config: Added `alltrue` and `anytrue` functions, which serve as a sort of dynamic version of the `&&` and `||` or operators, respectively. These are intended to allow evaluating boolean conditions, such as in variable `validation` blocks, across all of the items in a collection using `for` expressions. ([#25656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25656)], [[#26498](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26498))\n* config: New functions `textencodebase64` and `textdecodebase64` for encoding text in various character encodings other than UTF-8. ([#25470](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25470))\n* `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`: Added an experimental concise diff renderer. By default, Terraform plans now hide most unchanged fields, only displaying the most relevant changes and some identifying context. This experiment can be disabled by setting a `TF_X_CONCISE_DIFF` environment variable to `0`. ([#26187](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26187))\n* config: `ignore_changes` can now apply to map keys that are not listed in the configuration ([#26421](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26421))\n* `terraform console`: Now has distinct rendering of lists, sets, and tuples, and correctly renders objects with `null` attribute values. Multi-line strings are rendered using the \"heredoc\" syntax. ([#26189](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26189), [#27054](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27054))\n* `terraform login`: Added support for OAuth2 application scopes. ([#26239](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26239))\n* `terraform fmt`: Will now do some slightly more opinionated normalization behaviors, using the documented idiomatic syntax. ([#26390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26390))\n* `terraform init`'s provider installation step will now abort promptly if Terraform receives an interrupt signal. ([#26405](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26405))\n* cli: A new global command line option `-chdir=...`, placed before the selected subcommand, instructs Terraform to switch to a different working directory before executing the subcommand. This is similar to switching to a new directory with `cd` before running Terraform, but it avoids changing the state of the calling shell. ([#26087](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26087))\n* cli: help text is been reorganized to emphasize the main commands and improve consistency ([#26695](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26695))\n* cli: Ensure that provider requirements are met by the locked dependencies for every command. This will help catch errors if the configuration has changed since the last run of `terraform init`. ([#26761](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26761))\n* core: When sensitive values are used as part of provisioner configuration, logging is disabled to ensure the values are not displayed to the UI ([#26611](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26611))\n* core: `terraform plan` no longer uses a separate refresh phase. Instead, all resources are updated on-demand during planning ([#26270](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26270))\n* modules: Adds support for loading modules with S3 virtual hosted-style access ([#26914](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26914))\n* backend/consul: Split state into chunks when outgrowing the limit of the Consul KV store. This allows storing state larger than the Consul 512KB limit. ([#25856](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25856))\n* backend/consul: Add force-unlock support to the Consul backend ([#25837](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25837))\n* backend/gcs: Add service account impersonation to GCS backend ([#26837](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26837))\n* On Unix-based operating systems other than MacOS, the `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable can now be a colon-separated list of multiple certificate search paths. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n* On MacOS, Terraform will now use the `Security.framework` API to access the system trust roots, for improved consistency with other MacOS software. ([#26357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26357))\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* config: Report an error when provider configuration attributes are incorrectly added to a `required_providers` object. ([#26184](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26184))\n* config: Better errors for invalid terraform version constraints ([#26543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26543))\n* config: fix panic when `element()` is called with a negative offset ([#26079](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26079))\n* config: `lookup()` will now only treat map as unknown if it is wholly unknown ([#26427](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26427))\n* config: Fix provider detection for resources when local name does not match provider type ([#26871](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26871))\n* `terraform fmt`: Fix incorrect heredoc syntax in plan diff output ([#25725](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25725))\n* `terraform show`: Hide sensitive outputs from display ([#26740](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26740))\n* `terraform taint`: If the configuration's `required_version` constraint is not met, the `taint` subcommand will now correctly exit early. ([#26345](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26345))\n* `terraform taint` and `terraform untaint`: Fix issue when using `taint` (and `untaint`) with workspaces where statefile was not found. ([#22467](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22467))\n* `terraform init`: Fix locksfile constraint output for versions like \"1.2\". ([#26637](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26637))\n* `terraform init`: Omit duplicate version constraints when installing packages or writing locksfile. ([#26678](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26678))\n* cli: return an error on a state unlock failure [[#25729](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25729)] \n* core: Prevent \"Inconsistent Plan\" errors when using dynamic with a block of TypeSet ([#26638](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26638))\n* core: Errors with data sources reading old data during refresh, failing to refresh, and not appearing to wait on resource dependencies are fixed by updates to the data source lifecycle and the merging of refresh and plan ([#26270](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26270))\n* core: Prevent evaluation of deposed instances, which in turn prevents errors when referencing create_before_destroy resources that have changes to their count or for_each values ([#25631](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25631))\n* core: fix `state push -force` to work for all backends ([#26190](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26190))\n* backend/consul: Fix bug which prevented state locking when path has trailing `/` ([#25842](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25842))\n* backend/pg: Always have the default workspace in the pg backend ([#26420](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/26420))\n* backend/pg: Properly quote schema_name in the pg backend configuration ([#26476](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26476))\n* build: Fix crash with terraform binary on OpenBSD. ([#26249](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26249))\n* internal: Use default AWS credential handling when fetching modules ([#26762](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/26762))\n\nEXPERIMENTS:\n\n_Experiments_ are Terraform language features that are not yet finalized but that we've included in a release so you can potentially try them out and share feedback. These features are only available if you explicitly enable the relevant experiment for your module. To share feedback on active experiments, please open an enhancement request issue in the main Terraform repository.\n\n* `module_variable_optional_attrs`: When declaring an input variable for a module whose type constraint (`type` argument) contains an object type constraint, the type expressions for the attributes can be annotated with the experimental `optional(...)` modifier.\n\n    Marking an attribute as \"optional\" changes the type conversion behavior for that type constraint so that if the given value is a map or object that has no attribute of that name then Terraform will silently give that attribute the value `null`, rather than returning an error saying that it is required. The resulting value still conforms to the type constraint in that the attribute is considered to be present, but references to it in the recieving module will find a null value and can act on that accordingly.\n    \n    This experiment also includes a function named `defaults` which you can use in a local value to replace the null values representing optional attributes with non-null default values. The function also requires that you enable the `module_variable_optional_attrs` experiment for any module which calls it.\n    \n* `provider_sensitive_attrs`: This is an unusual experiment in that it doesn't directly allow you to use a new feature in your module configuration but instead it changes the automatic behavior of Terraform in modules where it's enabled.\n\n    For modules where this experiment is active, Terraform will consider the attribute sensitivity flags set in provider resource type schemas when propagating the \"sensitive\" flag through expressions in the configuration. This is experimental because it has the potential to make far more items in the output be marked as sensitive than before, and so we want to get some experience and feedback about it before hopefully making this the default behavior.\n    \n    One important consequence of enabling this experiment is that you may need to mark more of your module's output values as `sensitive = true`, in any case where a particular output value is derived from a value a provider has indicated as being sensitive. Without that explicit annotation, Terraform will return an error to avoid implicitly exposing a sensitive value via an output value.\n\nIf you try either of these features during their experimental periods and have feedback about them, please open a feature request issue. We are aiming to stabilize both features in the forthcoming v0.15 release, but their design may change in the meantime based on feedback. If we make further changes to the features during the v0.15 period then they will be reflected in v0.15 alpha releases.\n\n", "created_at": "2020-12-02T17:09:59Z", "project": "Terraform", "repo": "hashicorp/terraform", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.0.2", "tag_name": "1.0.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/1.0.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kuma", "body": "We are happy to announce the release of Kuma 1.0.2 with a few improvements and fixes, and we suggest to upgrade to start using the greatest and latest.\r\n\r\n**Notable Features:**\r\n\r\n* Added the Services view (Internal and External) to the GUI.\r\n* Updated Envoy to 1.16.1\r\n* Improvements to the DNS resolver in multi-zone deployments.\r\n* Fixes to the virtual probes.\r\n* And more!\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Kubernetes 1.18 is now the default version. Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes. \r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup. \r\n \r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper. \r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied. \r\n \r\n- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster. \r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Please refer to the zero downtime upgrades feature to read more about it. \r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nThe following versions are now latest and stable:\r\n\r\n  |Type | Rancher Version | Docker Tag |Helm Repo| Helm Chart Version |\r\n  |---|---|---|---|---|\r\n  | Latest | v2.4.11 | `rancher/rancher:latest` | server-charts/latest |v2.4.11 |\r\n  | Stable | v2.4.11 | `rancher/rancher:stable` | server-charts/stable | v2.4.11 | \r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements \r\n* Introduced support for UAE north region in AKS [[#28341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28341)]\r\n\r\n## Major Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.10\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused very high CPU usage in clusters with Project Network Isolation enabled. [[https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30048](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30048)], [[#30089](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30089)], [[#30052](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30052)]. \r\n> Note: This requires redeploying `nginx-ingress-controller`. Please refer to [this comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30045#issuecomment-731653007) for more details. \r\n* Fixed an issue where windows node with Mirantis container runtime docker 19.03.13 failed to join the cluster. [[#30148](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30148)]\r\n\r\n## Minor Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.10\r\n* Fixed an UI issue where catalog apps would automatically upgrade to the latest version if they're upgraded without any changes. [[#27891](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27891)] \r\n* Fixed an issue where Elasticsearch logged timestamps in only seconds, not nanoseconds. [[#29078](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29078)]\r\n* Fixed an issue where configuring alerts would result into webhook not found error, even if alerts aren't webhook forwarded. [[#30088](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30088)]\r\n\r\n### Air Gap Installations and Upgrades\r\n\r\nIn v2.4.0, an air gap installation no longer requires mirroring the systems chart git repo. Please follow the directions on how to [install Rancher to use the packaged systems chart](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap/install-rancher).\r\n\r\n### Other Upgrades\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]\r\n- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\"API Server Request Rate\"_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]\r\n- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue.

Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components.  Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see [the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n\r\n**Important:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected. \r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-30T23:47:12Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.2.0", "tag_name": "v2.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "body": "### Features\r\n- Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable `CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING` to `on`. Documentation is [available here](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#short-name-aliasing) and [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names).\r\n- Initial support has been added for the `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands, which allow existing containers to modify what networks they are connected to. At present, these commands can only be used on running containers that did not specify `--network=none` when they were created.\r\n- The `podman run` command now supports the `--network-alias` option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the `dnsname` CNI plugin is in use). Aliases can also be added and removed using the new `podman network connect` and `podman network disconnect` commands. Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the `dnsname` plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.\r\n- The `podman generate kube` command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits ([#7855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7855)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers ([#7742](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7742)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports persistent volumes claims using Podman named volumes.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the `--configmap` option ([#7567](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7567)).\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--log-driver` option to set the log driver for created containers.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports a `--start` option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for `podman play kube` to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.\r\n- The `podman network create` command now supports the `--ipv6` option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks ([#7302](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7302)).\r\n- The `podman inspect` command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images ([#6757](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6757)).\r\n- The `--mount` option for `podman run` and `podman create` now supports a new type, `image`, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.\r\n- The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the `podman-remote` executable have been added.\r\n- The `--log-opt` option for `podman create` and `podman run` now supports the `max-size` option to set the maximum size for a container's logs ([#7434](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7434)).\r\n- The `--network` option to the `podman pod create` command now allows pods to be configured to use `slirp4netns` networking, even when run as root ([#6097](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6097)).\r\n- The `podman pod stop`, `podman pod pause`, `podman pod unpause`, and `podman pod kill` commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.\r\n- The `podman search` command now supports a `--list-tags` option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.\r\n- The `podman search` command can now output JSON using the `--format=json` option.\r\n- The `podman diff` and `podman mount` commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.\r\n- The `podman container exists` command now features a `--external` option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.\r\n- The `--tls-verify` and `--authfile` options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.\r\n- The `/etc/hosts` file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with `--net=none` ([#8095](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8095)).\r\n- The `podman events` command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the `--filter label=key=value` option.\r\n- The `podman volume ls` command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the `--filter label=key=value` option.\r\n- The `--volume` and `--mount` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now support two new mount propagation options, `unbindable` and `runbindable`.\r\n- The `name` and `id` filters for `podman pod ps` now match based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.\r\n- The `podman pod ps` command now supports a new filter `status`, that matches pods in a certain state.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The `podman network rm --force` command will now also remove pods that are using the network ([#7791](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7791)).\r\n- The `podman volume rm`, `podman network rm`, and `podman pod rm` commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the `--force` option was not given.\r\n- If `/dev/fuse` is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.\r\n- Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from `podman-remote` (e.g. `--cgroup-manager`, `--storage-driver`).\r\n- Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.\r\n- The `--storage` option to `podman rm` is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the `--storage` option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The `--storage` option for `podman rm` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\r\n- The `--storage` option to `podman ps` has been renamed to `--external`. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.\r\n- Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage ([#7941](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7941)).\r\n- The `podman save` command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures ([#7659](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7659)).\r\n- A new `Degraded` state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be `Degraded` instead of `Running`.\r\n- Podman will now print a warning when conflicting network options related to port forwarding (e.g. `--publish` and `--net=host`) are specified when creating a container.\r\n- The `--restart on-failure` and `--rm` options for containers no longer conflict. When both are specified, the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero error code, and removed if it exits cleanly ([#7906](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7906)).\r\n- Remote Podman will no longer use settings from the client's `containers.conf`; defaults will instead be provided by the server's `containers.conf` ([#7657](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7657)).\r\n- The `podman network rm` command now has a new alias, `podman network remove` ([#8402](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8402)).\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman load` on the remote client did not error when attempting to load a directory, which is not yet supported for remote use.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could hang when the `newuidmap` binary was not installed ([#7776](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7776)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--pull` option to `podman run`, `podman create`,  and `podman build` did not match Docker's behavior.\r\n- Fixed a bug where sysctl settings from the `containers.conf` configuration file were applied, even if the container did not join the namespace associated with a sysctl.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would not return the text of errors encounted when trying to run a healthcheck for a container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman was accidentally setting the `containers` environment variable in addition to the expected `container` environment variable.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using CNI networking did not properly clean up DNS entries for removed containers ([#7789](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7789)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman untag --all` command was not supported with remote Podman.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command could time out even if active attach connections were present ([#7826](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7826)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would sometimes never time out despite no active connections being present.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman's handling of capabilities, specifically inheritable, did not match Docker's.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman run` would fail if the image specified was a manifest list and had already been pulled ([#7798](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/7798)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman did not take search registries into account when looking up images locally ([#6381](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6381)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest inspect` command would fail for images that had already been pulled ([#7726](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7726)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add supplemental GIDs to containers when when a user, but not a group, was set via the `--user` option to `podman create` and `podman run` and sufficient GIDs were available to add the groups ([#7782](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7782)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where remote Podman commands did not properly handle cases where the user gave a name that could also be a short ID for a pod or container ([#7837](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7837)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman image prune` could leave images ready to be pruned after `podman image prune` was run ([#7872](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7872)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs` command with the `journald` log driver would not read all available logs ([#7476](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7476)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--rm` and `--restart` options to `podman create` and `podman run` did not conflict when a restart policy that is not `on-failure` was chosen ([#7878](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7878)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format \"table {{ .Field }}\"` option to numerous Podman commands ceased to function on Podman v2.0 and up.\r\n- Fixed a bug where pods did not properly share an SELinux label between their containers, resulting in containers being unable to see the processes of other containers when the pod shared a PID namespace ([#7886](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7886)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--namespace` option to `podman ps` did not work with the remote client ([#7903](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7903)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman incorrectly calculated the number of UIDs available in the container if multiple different ranges of UIDs were specified.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `/etc/hosts` file would not be correctly populated for containers in a user namespace ([#7490](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7490)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman network create` and `podman network remove` commands could race when run in parallel, with unpredictable results ([#7807](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7807)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `-p` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create` would, when given only a single number (e.g. `-p 80`), assign the same port for both host and container, instead of generating a random host port ([#7947](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7947)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman containers did not properly store the cgroup manager they were created with, causing them to stop functioning after the cgroup manager was changed in `containers.conf` or with the `--cgroup-manager` option ([#7830](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7830)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman inspect` command did not include information on the CNI networks a container was connected to if it was not running.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman attach` command would not print a newline after detaching from the container ([#7751](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7751)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `HOME` environment variable was not set properly in containers when the `--userns=keep-id` option was set ([#8004](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8004)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman container restore` command could panic when the container in question was in a pod ([#8026](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8026)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the output of the `podman image trust show --raw` command was not properly formatted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman runlabel` command could panic if a label to run was not given ([#8038](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8038)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman start --attach` commands would exit with an error when the user detached manually using the detach keys on remote Podman ([#7979](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7979)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless CNI networking did not use the `dnsname` CNI plugin if it was not available on the host, despite it always being available in the container used for rootless networking ([#8040](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8040)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly handle cases where an OCI runtime is specified by its full path, and could revert to using another OCI runtime with the same binary path that existed in the system `$PATH` on subsequent invocations.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--net=host` option to `podman create` and `podman run` would cause the `/etc/hosts` file to be incorrectly populated ([#8054](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8054)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman inspect` command did not include container network information when the container shared its network namespace (IE, joined a pod or another container's network namespace via `--net=container:...`) ([#8073](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8073)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman ps` command did not include information on all ports a container was publishing.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command incorrectly forwarded `STDIN` into build containers from `RUN` instructions.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman wait` command's `--interval` option did not work when units were not specified for the duration ([#8088](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8088)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--detach-keys` and `--detach` options could be passed to `podman create` despite having no effect (and not making sense in that context).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could not start containers if running on a system without a `/etc/resolv.conf` file (which occurs on some WSL2 images) ([#8089](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8089)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--extract` option to `podman cp` was nonfunctional.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--cidfile` option to `podman run` would, when the container was not run with `--detach`, only create the file after the container exited ([#8091](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8091)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman images` and `podman images -a` commands could panic and not list any images when certain improperly-formatted images were present in storage ([#8148](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8148)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman events` command could, when the `journald` events backend was in use, become nonfunctional when a badly-formatted event or a log message that container certain string was present in the journal ([#8125](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8125)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where remote Podman would, when using SSH transport, not authenticate to the server using hostkeys when connecting on a port other than 22 ([#8139](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8139)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman attach` command would not exit when containers stopped ([#8154](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8154)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman did not properly clean paths before verifying them, resulting in Podman refusing to start if the root or temporary directories were specified with extra trailing `/` characters ([#8160](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8160)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where remote Podman did not support hashed hostnames in the `known_hosts` file on the host for establishing connections ([#8159](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/8159)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman image exists` command would return non-zero (false) when multiple potential matches for the given name existed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest inspect` command on images that are not manifest lists would error instead of inspecting the image ([#8023](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8023)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would fail if the directory the Unix socket was to be created inside did not exist ([#8184](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8184)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where pods that shared the IPC namespace (which is done by default) did not share a `/dev/shm` filesystem between all containers in the pod ([#8181](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8181)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where filters passed to `podman volume list` were not inclusive ([#6765](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6765)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume create` command would fail when the volume's data directory already existed (as might occur when a volume was not completely removed) ([#8253](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8253)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman create` commands would deadlock when trying to create a container that mounted the same named volume at multiple locations (e.g. `podman run -v testvol:/test1 -v testvol:/test2`) ([#8221](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8221)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the parsing of the `--net` option to `podman build` was incorrect ([#8322](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8322)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build` command would print the ID of the built image twice when using remote Podman ([#8332](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8332)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command did not show memory limits for containers ([#8265](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8265)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod inspect` command printed the static MAC address of the pod in a non-human-readable format ([#8386](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/8386)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--tls-verify` option of the `podman play kube` command had its logic inverted (`false` would enforce the use of TLS, `true` would disable it).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman network rm` command would error when trying to remove `macvlan` networks and rootless CNI networks ([#8491](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8491)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman was not setting sane defaults for missing `XDG_` environment variables.\r\n- Fixed a bug where remote Podman would check if volume paths to be mounted in the container existed on the host, not the server ([#8473](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8473)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest create` and `podman manifest add` commands on local images would drop any images in the manifest not pulled by the host.\r\n- Fixed a bug where networks made by `podman network create` did not include the `tuning` plugin, and as such did not support setting custom MAC addresses ([#8385](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8385)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where container healthchecks did not use `$PATH` when searching for the Podman executable to run the healthcheck.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--ip-range` option to `podman network create` did not properly handle non-classful subnets when calculating the last usable IP for DHCP assignment ([#8448](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8448)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman container ps` alias for `podman ps` was missing ([#8445](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8445)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Container has received a major refactor to share more code with the Libpod Create endpoint, and should be significantly more stable.\r\n- A Compat endpoint for exporting multiple images at once, `GET /images/get`, has been added ([#7950](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7950)).\r\n- The Compat Network Connect and Network Disconnect endpoints have been added.\r\n- Endpoints that deal with image registries now support a `X-Registry-Config` header to specify registry authentication configuration.\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for images now properly supports specifying images by digest.\r\n- The Libpod Build endpoint for images now supports an `httpproxy` query parameter which, if set to true, will forward the server's HTTP proxy settings into the build container for `RUN` instructions.\r\n- The Libpod Untag endpoint for images will now remove all tags for the given image if no repository and tag are specified for removal.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Ping endpoint misspelled a header name (`Libpod-Buildha-Version` instead of `Libpod-Buildah-Version`).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Ping endpoint sent an extra newline at the end of its response where Docker did not.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Logs endpoint for containers did not send a newline character after each log line.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Logs endpoint for containers would mangle line endings to change newline characters to add a preceding carriage return ([#7942](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7942)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers did not properly list the container's stop signal ([#7917](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7917)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers formatted the container's create time incorrectly ([#7860](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7860)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers did not include the container's Path, Args, and Restart Count.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for Containers prefixed added and dropped capabilities with `CAP_` (Docker does not do so).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Info endpoint for the Engine did not include configured registries.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the server could panic if a client closed a connection midway through an image pull ([#7896](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7896)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for volumes returned an error when a volume with the same name already existed, instead of succeeding with a 201 code ([#7740](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7740)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a client disconnecting from the Libpod or Compat events endpoints could result in the server using 100% CPU ([#7946](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/7946)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the \"no such image\" error message sent by the Compat Inspect endpoint for Images returned a 404 status code with an error that was improperly formatted for Docker compatibility.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for networks did not properly set a default for the `driver` parameter if it was not provided by the client.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for images did not populate the `RootFS` field of the response.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Inspect endpoint for images would omit the `ParentId` field if the image had no parent, and the `Created` field if the image did not have a creation time.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Remove endpoint for Networks did not support the `Force` query parameter.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.18.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.1\r\n- Updated the

This simplifies installation under Ubuntu to a single command:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  snap install victoriametrics\r\n  ```\r\n* FEATURE: vmselect: add `-replicationFactor` command-line flag for reducing query duration when replication is enabled and a part of vmstorage nodes are temporarily slow and/or temporarily unavailable. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/711\r\n* FEATURE: vminsert: export `vm_rpc_vmstorage_is_reachable` metric, which can be used for monitoring reachability of vmstorage nodes from vminsert nodes.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add [Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) service discovery (aka [eureka_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#eureka_sd_config)). See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/851\r\n* FEATURE: add `filters` option to `dockerswarm_sd_config` like Prometheus did in v2.23.0 - see https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/8074\r\n* FEATURE: expose `__meta_ec2_ipv6_addresses` label for `ec2_sd_config` like Prometheus will do in the next release.\r\n* FEATURE: add `-loggerWarnsPerSecondLimit` command-line flag for rate limiting of WARN messages in logs. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/905\r\n* FEATURE: apply `loggerErrorsPerSecondLimit` and `-loggerWarnsPerSecondLimit` rate limit per caller. I.e. log messages are suppressed if the same caller logs the same message at the rate exceeding the given limit. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/905#issuecomment-729395855\r\n* FEATURE: add remoteAddr to slow query log in order to simplify identifying the client that sends slow queries to VictoriaMetrics. Slow query logging is controlled with `-search.logSlowQueryDuration` command-line flag.\r\n* FEATURE: add `/tags/delSeries` handler from Graphite Tags API. See https://victoriametrics.github.io/#graphite-tags-api-usage\r\n* FEATURE: log metric name plus all its labels when the metric timestamp is out of the configured retention. This should simplify detecting the source of metrics with unexpected timestamps.\r\n* FEATURE: add `-dryRun` command-line flag to single-node VictoriaMetrics in order to check config file pointed by `-promscrape.config`.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: properly parse Prometheus metrics with [exemplars](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/master/OpenMetrics.md#exemplars-1) such as `foo 123 # {bar=\"baz\"} 1`.\r\n* BUGFIX: properly parse \"infinity\" values in [OpenMetrics format](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/master/OpenMetrics.md#abnf). See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/924\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).\r\n\r\n[vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/vmctl) releases are available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/vmctl/releases).", "created_at": "2020-11-26T00:06:34Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.4.14", "tag_name": "v3.4.14", "html_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.4.14", "repo_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd", "body": "Please check out [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/CHANGELOG-3.4.md) for a full list of changes.

Application Access works with everything from dashboards to single page Javascript applications (SPA).\r\n\r\nApplication Access uses mutually authenticated reverse tunnels to establish a secure connection with the Teleport unified Access Plane which can then becomes the single ingress point for all traffic to an internal application.\r\n\r\nAdding an application follows the same UX as adding SSH servers or Kubernetes clusters, starting with creating a static or dynamic invite token.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ tctl tokens add --type=app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen simply start Teleport with a few new flags.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \\\r\n    --app-name=\"example-app\" \\\r\n    --app-uri=\"http://localhost:8080\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will start an app server that proxies the application \"example-app\" running at `http://localhost:8080` at the public address `https://example-app.example.com`.\r\n\r\nApplications can also be configured using the new `app_service` section in `teleport.yaml`.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napp_service:\r\n   # Teleport Application Access is enabled.\r\n   enabled: yes\r\n   # We've added a default sample app that will check\r\n   # that Teleport Application Access is working\r\n   # and output JWT tokens.\r\n   # https://dumper.teleport.example.com:3080/\r\n   debug_app: true\r\n   apps:\r\n   # Application Access can be used to proxy any HTTP endpoint.\r\n   # Note: Name can't include any spaces and should be DNS-compatible A-Za-z0-9-._\r\n   - name: \"internal-dashboard\"\r\n     uri: \"http://10.0.1.27:8000\"\r\n     # By default Teleport will make this application\r\n     # available on a sub-domain of your Teleport proxy's hostname\r\n     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com\r\n     # - thus the importance of setting up wilcard DNS.\r\n     # If you want, it's possible to set up a custom public url.\r\n     # DNS records should point to the proxy server.\r\n     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com\r\n     # Example Public URL for the internal-dashboard app.\r\n     # public_addr: \"internal-dashboard.acme.com\"\r\n     # Optional labels\r\n     # Labels can be combined with RBAC rules to provide access.\r\n     labels:\r\n       customer: \"acme\"\r\n       env: \"production\"\r\n     # Optional dynamic labels\r\n     commands:\r\n     - name: \"os\"\r\n       command: [\"/usr/bin/uname\"]\r\n       period: \"5s\"\r\n     # A proxy can support multiple applications. Application Access\r\n     # can also be deployed with a Teleport node.\r\n     - name: \"arris\"\r\n       uri: \"http://localhost:3001\"\r\n       public_addr: \"arris.example.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplication access requires two additional changes. DNS must be updated to point the application domain to the proxy and the proxy must be loaded with a TLS certificate for the domain. Wildcard DNS and TLS certificates can be used to simplify deployment.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# When adding the app_service certificates are required to provide a TLS\r\n# connection. The certificates are managed by the proxy_service\r\nproxy_service:\r\n  # We've extended support for https certs. Teleport can now load multiple\r\n  # TLS certificates. In the below example we've obtained a wildcard cert\r\n  # that'll be used for proxying the applications.\r\n  # The correct certificate is selected based on the hostname in the HTTPS\r\n  # request using SNI.\r\n  https_keypairs:\r\n  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem\r\n    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem\r\n  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem\r\n    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can learn more at [https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/)\r\n\r\n### Teleport Kubernetes Access\r\n\r\nTeleport 5.0 also introduces two highly requested features for Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n* The ability to connect multiple Kubernetes Clusters to the Teleport Access Plane, greatly reducing operational complexity.\r\n* Complete Kubernetes audit log capture [#4526](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4526), going beyond the existing `kubectl exec` capture.\r\n\r\nFor a full overview please review the [Kubernetes RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0005-kubernetes-service.md).\r\n\r\nTo support these changes, we've introduced a new service. This moves Teleport Kubernetes configuration from the `proxy_service` into its own dedicated `kubernetes_service` section.\r\n\r\nWhen adding the new Kubernetes service, a new type of join token is required.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntctl tokens add --type=kube\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample configuration for the new `kubernetes_service`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# ...\r\nkubernetes_service:\r\n   enabled: yes\r\n   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027\r\n   kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: a Kubernetes port still needs to be configured in the `proxy_service` via `kube_listen_addr`.\r\n\r\n#### New \"tsh kube\" commands\r\n\r\n`tsh kube` commands are used to query registered clusters and switch `kubeconfig` context:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=awly\r\n\r\n# list all registered clusters\r\n$ tsh kube ls\r\nCluster Name       Status\r\n-------------      ------\r\na.k8s.example.com  online\r\nb.k8s.example.com  online\r\nc.k8s.example.com  online\r\n\r\n# on login, kubeconfig is pointed at the first cluster (alphabetically)\r\n$ kubectl config current-context\r\nproxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com\r\n\r\n# but all clusters are populated as contexts\r\n$ kubectl config get-contexts\r\nCURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER             AUTHINFO\r\n*         proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com\r\n          proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com\r\n          proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com\r\n\r\n# switch between different clusters:\r\n$ tsh kube login c.k8s.example.com\r\n\r\n# the traditional way is also supported:\r\n$ kubectl config use-context proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com\r\n\r\n# check current cluster\r\n$ kubectl config current-context\r\nproxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther Kubernetes changes:\r\n\r\n* Support k8s clusters behind firewall/NAT using a single Teleport cluster [#3667](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3667)\r\n* Support multiple k8s clusters with a single Teleport proxy instance [#3952](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3952)\r\n\r\n### Additional User and Token Resource\r\n\r\nWe've added two new RBAC resources; these provide the ability to limit token creation and to list and modify Teleport users:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- resources: [user]\r\n  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]\r\n- resources: [token]\r\n  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLearn more about [Teleport's RBAC Resources](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/ssh-rbac/)\r\n\r\n### Cluster Labels\r\n\r\nTeleport 5.0 also adds the ability to set labels on Trusted Clusters. The labels are set when creating a trusted cluster invite token. This lets teams use the same RBAC controls used on nodes to approve or deny access to clusters. This can be especially useful for MSPs that connect hundreds of customers' clusters - when combined with Access Workflows, cluster access can easily be delegated. Learn more by reviewing our [Truster Cluster Setup & RBAC Docs](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/#dynamic-join-tokens)\r\n\r\nCreating a trusted cluster join token for a production environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --labels=env=prod\r\n```\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: role\r\n#...\r\n  deny:\r\n    # cluster labels control what clusters user can connect to. The wildcard ('*')\r\n    # means any cluster. By default, deny rules are empty to preserve backwards\r\n    # compatibility\r\n    cluster_labels:\r\n      'env': 'prod'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Teleport UI Updates\r\n\r\nTeleport 5.0 also iterates on the UI Refresh from 4.3. We've moved the cluster list into our sidebar and have added an Application launcher. For customers moving from 4.4 to 5.0, you'll notice that we have moved session recordings back to their own dedicated section.\r\n\r\nOther updates:\r\n\r\n* We now provide local user management via `https://[cluster-url]/web/users`, providing the ability to easily edit, reset and delete local users.\r\n* Teleport Node & App Install scripts. This is currently an Enterprise-only feature that provides customers with an easy 'auto-magic' installer script. Enterprise customers can enable this feature by modifying the 'token' resource. See note above.\r\n* We've added a Waiting Room for customers using Access Workflows. [Docs](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/workflow/#adding-a-reason-to-access-workflows)\r\n\r\n### Signed RPM and Releases\r\n\r\nStarting with Teleport 5.0, we now provide an RPM repo for stable releases of Teleport. We've also started signing our RPMs to provide assurance that you're always using an official build of Teleport.\r\n\r\nSee https://rpm.releases.teleport.dev/ for more details.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Added `--format=json` playback option for `tsh play`. For example `tsh play --format=json ~/play/0c0b81ed-91a9-4a2a-8d7c-7495891a6ca0.tar | jq '.event` can be used to show all events within an a local archive. [#4578](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4578)\r\n* Added support for continuous backups and auto scaling for DynamoDB. [#4780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4780)\r\n* Added a Linux ARM64/ARMv8 (64-bit) Release. [#3383](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3383)\r\n* Added `https_keypairs` field which replaces `https_key_file` and `https_cert_file`. This allows administrators to load multiple HTTPS certs for Teleport Application Access. Teleport 5.0 is backwards compatible with the old format, but we recommend updating your configuration to use `https_keypairs`.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Only:\r\n\r\n* `tctl` can load credentials from `~/.tsh` [#4678](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4678)\r\n* Teams can require a user submitted reason when using Access Workflows [#4573](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4573#issuecomment-720777443)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Updated `tctl` to always format resources as lists in JSON/YAML. [#4281](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4281)\r\n* Updated `tsh status` to now print Kubernetes status. [#4348](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4348)\r\n* Fixed intermittent issues with `loginuid.so`. [#3245](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3245)\r\n* Reduced `access denied to Proxy` log spam. [#2920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2920)\r\n* Various AMI fixes: paths are now consistent with other Teleport packages and configuration files will not be overwritten on reboot.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nWe've added an [API Reference](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/api-reference/) to simply developing applications against Teleport.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\nPlease follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).\r\n\r\n* Optional: Consider updating `https_key_file` & `https_cert_file` to our new `https_keypairs:` format.\r\n* Optional: Consider migrating Kubernetes Access from `proxy_service` to `kubernetes_service` after the upgrade.", "created_at": "2020-11-24T19:59:37Z", "project": "Teleport", "repo": "gravitational/teleport", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.9.0", "tag_name": "v1.9.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.9.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul", "body": "## 1.9.0 (November 24, 2020)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n\n* agent: The `enable_central_service_config` option now defaults to true. [[GH-8746](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8746)]\n* connect: Switch the default gateway port from 443 to 8443 to avoid assumption of Envoy running as root. [[GH-9113](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9113)]\n* connect: Update Envoy metrics names and labels for proxy listeners so that attributes like datacenter and namespace can be extracted. [[GH-9207](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9207)]\n* connect: intention destinations can no longer be reassigned [[GH-8834](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8834)]\n* raft: Raft protocol v2 is no longer supported. If currently using protocol v2 then an intermediate upgrade to a version supporting both v2 and v3 protocols will be necessary (1.0.0 - 1.8.x). Note that the Raft protocol configured with the `raft_protocol` setting and the Consul RPC protocol configured with the `protocol` setting and output by the `consul version` command are distinct and supported Consul RPC protocol versions are not altered. [[GH-9103](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9103)]\n* sentinel: **(Consul Enterprise only)** update to v0.16.0, which replaces `whitelist` and `blacklist` with `allowlist` and `denylist`\n* server: **(Enterprise only)** Pre-existing intentions defined with\nnon-existent destination namespaces were non-functional and are erased during\nthe upgrade process. This should not matter as these intentions had nothing to\nenforce. [[GH-9186](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9186)]\n* server: **(OSS only)** Pre-existing intentions defined with either a source or\ndestination namespace value that is not \"default\" are rewritten or deleted\nduring the upgrade process. Wildcards first attempt to downgrade to \"default\"\nunless an intention already exists, otherwise these non-functional intentions\nare deleted. [[GH-9186](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9186)]\n* xds: Drop support for Envoy versions 1.12.0, 1.12.1, 1.12.2, and 1.13.0, due to a lack of support for url_path in RBAC. [[GH-8839](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8839)]\n\nSECURITY:\n\n* Fix Consul Enterprise Namespace Config Entry Replication DoS. Previously an operator with service:write ACL permissions in a Consul Enterprise cluster could write a malicious config entry that caused infinite raft writes due to issues with the namespace replication logic. [[CVE-2020-25201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25201)] [[GH-9024](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9024)]\n* Increase the permissions to read from the `/connect/ca/configuration` endpoint to `operator:write`. Previously Connect CA configuration, including the private key, set via this endpoint could be read back by an operator with `operator:read` privileges. [CVE-2020-28053](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28053) [[GH-9240](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9240)]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* agent: Add a new RPC endpoint for streaming cluster state change events to clients.\n* agent: Allow client agents to be configured with an advertised reconnect timeout to control how long until the nodes are reaped by others in the cluster. [[GH-8781](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8781)]\n* agent: moved ui config options to a new `ui_config` stanza in agent configuration and added new options to display service metrics in the UI. [[GH-8694](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8694)]\n* agent: return the default ACL policy to callers as a header [[GH-9101](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9101)]\n* autopilot: A new `/v1/operator/autopilot/state` HTTP API was created to give greater visibility into what autopilot is doing and how it has classified all the servers it is tracking. [[GH-9103](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9103)]\n* autopilot: Added a new `consul operator autopilot state` command to retrieve and view the Autopilot state from consul. [[GH-9142](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9142)]\n* cli: update `snapshot inspect` command to provide more detailed snapshot data [[GH-8787](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8787)]\n* connect: support defining intentions using layer 7 criteria [[GH-8839](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8839)]\n* telemetry: add initialization and definition for non-expiring key metrics in Prometheus [[GH-9088](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9088)]\n* telemetry: track node and service counts and emit them as metrics [[GH-8603](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8603)]\n* ui: If Prometheus is being used for monitoring the sidecars, the topology view can be configured to display overview metrics for the services. [[GH-8858](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8858)]\n* ui: Services using Connect with Envoy sidecars have a topology tab in the UI showing their upstream and downstream services. [[GH-8788](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8788)]\n* xds: use envoy's rbac filter to handle intentions entirely within envoy [[GH-8569](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8569)]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* agent: Return HTTP 429 when connections per clients limit (`limits.http_max_conns_per_client`) has been reached. [[GH-8221](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8221)]\n* agent: add path_allowlist config option to restrict metrics proxy queries [[GH-9059](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9059)]\n* agent: allow the /v1/connect/intentions/match endpoint to use the agent cache [[GH-8875](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8875)]\n* agent: protect the metrics proxy behind ACLs [[GH-9099](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9099)]\n* api: The `v1/connect/ca/roots` endpoint now accepts a `pem=true` query parameter and will return a PEM encoded certificate chain of all the certificates that would normally be in the JSON version of the response. [[GH-8774](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8774)]\n* api: support GetMeta() and GetNamespace() on all config entry kinds [[GH-8764](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8764)]\n* autopilot: **(Enterprise Only)** Autopilot now supports using both Redundancy Zones and Automated Upgrades together. [[GH-9103](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9103)]\n* checks: add health status to the failure message when gRPC healthchecks fail. [[GH-8726](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8726)]\n* chore: Update to Go 1.15 with mitigation for [golang/go#42138](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42138) [[GH-9036](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9036)]\n* command: remove conditional envoy bootstrap generation for versions <=1.10.0 since those are not supported [[GH-8855](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8855)]\n* connect: The Vault provider will now automatically renew the lease of the token used, if supported. [[GH-8560](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8560)]\n* connect: add support for specifying load balancing policy in service-resolver [[GH-8585](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8585)]\n* connect: intentions are now managed as a new config entry kind \"service-intentions\" [[GH-8834](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8834)]\n* raft: Update raft to v1.2.0 to prevent non-voters from becoming eligible for leader elections and adding peer id as metric label to reduce cardinality in metric names [[GH-8822](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8822)]\n* server: **(Consul Enterprise only)** ensure that we also shutdown network segment serf instances on server shutdown [[GH-8786](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8786)]\n* server: break up Intention.Apply monolithic method [[GH-9007](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9007)]\n* server: create new memdb table for storing system metadata [[GH-8703](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8703)]\n* server: make sure that the various replication loggers use consistent logging [[GH-8745](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8745)]\n* server: remove config entry CAS in legacy intention API bridge code [[GH-9151](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9151)]\n* snapshot agent: Deregister critical snapshotting TTL check if leadership is transferred.\n* telemetry: All metrics should be present and available to prometheus scrapers when Consul starts. If any non-deprecated metrics are missing please submit an issue with its name. [[GH-9198](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9198)]\n* telemetry: add config flag `telemetry { disable_compat_1.9 = (true|false) }` to disable deprecated metrics in 1.9 [[GH-8877](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8877)]\n* telemetry: add counter `consul.api.http` with labels for each HTTP path and method. This is intended to replace `consul.http...` [[GH-8877](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8877)]\n* ui: Add the Upstreams and Exposed Paths tabs for services in mesh [[GH-9141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9141)]\n* ui: Moves the Proxy health checks to be displayed with the Service health check under the Health Checks tab [[GH-9141](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9141)]\n* ui: Upstream and downstream services in the topology tab will show a visual indication if a deny intention or intention with L7 policies is configured. [[GH-8846](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8846)]\n* ui: add dashboard_url_template config option for external dashboard links [[GH-9002](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9002)]\n\nDEPRECATIONS:\n\n* Go 1.15 has dropped support for 32-bit binaries for Darwin, so darwin_386 builds will not be available for any 1.9.x+ releases. [[GH-9036](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9036)]\n* agent: `ui`, `ui_dir` and `ui_content_path` are now deprecated for use in agent configuration files. Use `ui_config.{enable, dir, content_path}` instead. The command arguments `-ui`, `-ui-dir`, and `-ui-content-path` remain supported. [[GH-8694](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8694)]\n* telemetry: The measurements in all of the `consul.http...` prefixed metrics have been migrated to `consul.api.http`. `consul.http...` prefixed metrics will be removed in a future version of Consul. [[GH-8877](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8877)]\n* telemetry: the disable_compat_1.9 config will cover more metrics deprecations in future 1.9 point releases. These metrics will be emitted twice for backwards compatibility - if the flag is true, only the new metric name will be written. [[GH-9181](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9181)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* agent: make the json/hcl decoding of ConnectProxyConfig fully work with CamelCase and snake_case [[GH-8741](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8741)]\n* agent: when enable_central_service_config is enabled ensure agent reload doesn't revert check state to critical [[GH-8747](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8747)]\n* api: Fixed a bug where the Check.GRPCUseTLS field could not be set using snake case. [[GH-8771](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/8771)]\n* autopilot: **(Enterprise Only)** Previously servers in other zones would not be promoted when all servers in a second zone had failed. Now the actual behavior matches the docs and autopilot will promote a healthy non-voter from any zone to replace failure of an entire zone. [[GH-9103](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/9103)]\n* autopilot: Prevent panic when requesting the autopilot health immediately after a leader is elected.

RPMs and the K3s Yum repo were not well-publicized offerings, and will require some refactoring to our CI pipeline before we can bring them back again.\r\n- When using managed etcd, nodes that are deleted from the cluster, or fail partway through joining the cluster, cannot be automatically rejoined without manual intervention. You may see one of the following errors in the logs on the joining node:\r\n    ```\r\n    node has been delete from the cluster.

Mayastor seeing higher adoption rates resulting in further fixes and enhancements. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the key highlights in this release:\r\n\r\n### New capabilities\r\n\r\n- ARM64 support (declared beta) for OpenEBS Data Engines - cStor, Jiva, Local PV (hostpath and device), ZFS Local PV.\r\n  - A significant improvement in this release is the support for multi-arch container images for amd64 and arm64. The multi-arch images are available on the docker hub and will enable the users to run OpenEBS in the Kubernetes cluster that has a mix of arm64 and amd64 nodes.\r\n  - In addition to ARM64 support, Local PV (hostpath and device) multi-arch container images include support for arm32 and power system.\r\n  - The arch-specific container images like `<image name>-amd64:<image-tag>`, are also made available from docker hub and quay to support backward compatibility to users running OpenEBS deployments with arch-specific images.\r\n  - To upgrade your volumes to multi-arch containers, make sure you specify the `to-image` to the multi-arch image available from docker or your own copy of it.\r\n  - A special shout and many thanks to @xUnholy @shubham14bajpai, @akhilerm, and @prateekpandey14 for adding the multi-arch support to 27 OpenEBS container images generated from 14+ GitHub repositories. @wangzihao3, @radicand, @sgielen, @Pensu, and many more users from our slack community for helping with testing, feedback, and fixes by using the early versions of ARM64 builds in dev and production.\r\n\r\n- Enhanced the cStor Velero Plugin to help with automating the restore from an incremental backup. Restoring an incremental backup involves restoring the full backup (also called base backup and subsequent incremental backups till the desired incremental backup. With this release, the user can set a new parameter(`restoreAllIncrementalSnapshots`) in the `VolumeSnapshotLocation` to automate the restore of the required base and incremental backups. For detailed instructions to try this feature, please refer to this [doc](https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin#creating-a-restore-from-scheduled-remote-backup). \r\n\r\n- OpenEBS Mayastor is seeing tremendous growth in terms of users trying it out and providing feedback. A lot of work in this release has gone into fixing issues, enhancing the e2e tests and control plane, and adding initial support for snapshots. For further details on enhancements and bug fixes in Mayastor, please refer to [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Enhanced Node Disk Manager (NDM) to discover and create Block Device custom resources for device mapper(dm) devices like `loopback` devices, `luks` encrypted devices, and `LVM` devices. Prior to this release, if users had to use dm devices, they would have to manually create the corresponding Block Device CRs.   \r\n- Enhanced the NDM block device tagging feature to reserve a block device from being assigned to Local PV (device) or cStor data engines. The block device can be reserved by specifying an empty value for the block device tag.\r\n- Added support to install ZFS Local PV using Kustomize. Also updated the default upgrade strategy for the ZFS CSI driver to run in parallel instead of rolling upgrades.\r\n- Several enhancements and fixes from the Community towards OpenEBS documentation, build and release scripts from the Hacktoberfest participation. \r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue with the upgrade of cStor and Jiva volumes in cases where volumes are provisioned without enabling monitoring side car.\r\n- Fixed an issue with the upgrade that would always set the image registry as`quay.io/openebs`, when upgrade job doesn't specify the registry location. The upgrade job will now fallback to the registry that is already configured on the existing pods.\r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- OpenEBS has applied for becoming a CNCF incubation project and is currently undergoing a Storage SIG review of the project and addressing the review comment provided. \r\n- Significant work is underway to make it easier to install only the components that the users finally decide to use for their workloads. These features will allow users to run different flavors of OpenEBS in K8s clusters optimized for the workloads they intend to run in the cluster. This can be achieved in the current version using a customized helm values file or using a modified Kubernetes manifest file. \r\n- Repositories are being re-factored to help simplify the contributor onboarding process. For instance, with this release, the `dynamic-localpv-provisioner` has been moved from [openebs/maya](https://github.com/openebs/maya/tree/master/cmd/provisioner-localpv) to its own repository as [openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner). This refactoring of the source code will also help with the simplified build and faster release process per data engine. \r\n- Automation of further Day 2 operations like - setting of cStor target IP after the cstor volume has been restored from a backup (Thanks to @zlymeda), automatically detecting a node deletion from the cluster, and re-balancing the volume replicas onto the next available node. \r\n- Keeping the OpenEBS generated Kubernetes custom resources in sync with the upstream Kubernetes versions, like moving CRDs from `v1beta1` to `v1`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @shock0572 (ExactLab),  @yydzhou (ByteDance), @kuja53, and @darioneto for becoming a public reference and supporter of OpenEBS by sharing your use case on [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS? You can help OpenEBS in its journey towards becoming CNCF Incubation project by sharing your OpenEBS story and join the league of [OpenEBS Adopters](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2719).\r\n\r\n### Shout outs!\r\n\r\n_MANY THANKS_ to our existing contributors and for everyone helping OpenEBS Community going. \r\n\r\nA very special thanks to our  **first-time** contributors to code, tests, and docs:  @filip-lebiecki, @hack3r-0m, @mtzaurus, @niladrih, @Akshay-Nagle, @Aman1440, @AshishMhrzn10, @Hard-Coder05, @ItsJulian, @KaranSinghBisht, @Naveenkhasyap, @Nelias, @Shivam7-1, @ShyamGit01, @Sumindar, @Taranzz25, @archit041198, @aryanrawlani28, @codegagan, @de-sh, @harikrishnajiju, @heygroot, @hnifmaghfur, @iTechsTR, @iamrajiv, @infiniteoverflow, @invidian, @kichloo, @lambda2, @lucasqueiroz, @prakhargurunani, @prakharshreyash15, @rafael-rosseto, @sabbatum, @salonigoyal2309, @sparkingdark, @sudhinm, @trishitapingolia, @vijay5158, @vmr1532. \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite to install\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.14+ or newer release is installed. \r\n- Kubernetes 1.17+ is recommended for using cStor CSI drivers.\r\n- Make sure that you run the below installation steps with the cluster-admin context. The installation will involve creating a new Service Account and assigning it to OpenEBS components.\r\n- Make sure [iSCSI Initiator](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html) is installed on the Kubernetes nodes.\r\n- Node-Disk-Manager (NDM) helps in discovering the devices attached to Kubernetes nodes, which can be used to create storage pools. If you like to exclude some of the disks from getting discovered, update the filters in [NDM Config Map](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugndm.html) to exclude paths before installing OpenEBS.\r\n- NDM runs as a privileged pod since it needs to access the device information. Please make the necessary changes to grant access to run in privileged mode. For example, when running in RHEL/CentOS, you may need to set the security context appropriately. Refer [Configuring OpenEBS with selinux=on](https://blog.openebs.io/configuring-openebs-to-run-with-security-enhanced-linux-1e5a90a91da2)\r\n\r\n### Install using kubectl\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/2.3.0/openebs-operator.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install using Helm stable charts\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install --namespace openebs --name openebs openebs/openebs --version 2.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details refer to the documentation at https://docs.openebs.io/\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade to 2.3 is supported only from 1.0 or higher and follows a similar process as earlier releases. Detailed steps are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n- Upgrade OpenEBS Control Plane components.\r\n- Upgrade Jiva PVs to 2.3, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n- Upgrade CStor Pools to 2.3 and its associated Volumes, either one at a time or multiple volumes. \r\n\r\nFor upgrading from releases prior to 1.0, please refer to the respective release upgrade [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s/upgrades).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf you are having issues in setting up or upgrade, you can contact:\r\n- OpenEBS Community for Support on [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io)\r\n    - Already signed up?

If you are using the cStor Storage Engine, please review the following before upgrading to this release.\r\n\r\n- The recommended approach for deploying cStor Pools is using the new custom resource called cStorPoolCluster (CSPC). Even though the provisioning of cStor Pools using StoragePoolClaim(SPC) is supported, it will be deprecated in future releases. The pools provisioned using SPC can be easily migrated to CSPC.  \r\n- When using cStor Pools, make sure that raw block devices are available on the nodes. If the block devices are formatted with a filesystem or mounted, then cStor Pool will not be created on the block device. In the current release, there are [manual steps](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/t-volume-provisioning.html#cstor-pool-pod-not-running) that could be followed to clear the filesystem or use partitions for creating cStor Pools, please reach out to the community (#openebs) at https://slack.k8s.io.\r\n- If you are using cStor pools with ephemeral devices, starting with 1.2 - upon node restart, cStor Pool will not be automatically re-created on the new devices. This check has been put to make sure that nodes are not accidentally restarted with new disks. The steps to recover from such a situation are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/maya/pull/1401#issue-308355304), which involve changing the status of the corresponding CSP to `Init`.\r\n- Capacity over-provisioning is enabled by default on the cStor pools. If you don\u2019t have alerts set up for monitoring the usage of the cStor pools, the pools can be fully utilized and the volumes can get into a read-only state. To avoid this, set up resource quotas as described in https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2855.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-15T18:05:57Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.0", "tag_name": "v1.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/m3db/m3/releases/tag/v1.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/m3db/m3", "body": "# Changelog\r\n\r\n# 1.0.0\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis release makes breaking changes to the APIs and configuration to provide a simpler experience both for setup and operating M3.\r\n\r\n- New [M3 website](https://m3db.io/).\r\n- New [M3 documentation](https://m3db.io/docs).\r\n- Simple [M3DB configuration](https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/src/dbnode/config/m3dbnode-local-etcd.yml) and [guides](https://m3db.io/docs/quickstart/docker/).\r\n- M3DB [hard limits](https://m3db.io/docs/operational_guide/resource_limits/) limits for high resiliency under load.\r\n- Bootstrap rearchitecture, now able to boostrap hundreds of millions of recently written datapoints in minutes for reads on restart.\r\n- Continued focus on baseline performance release-over-release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- **M3DB**: Namespace resolution and retention now configured dynamically via API and stored in etcd instead of being defined statically in M3Coordinator configuration.\r\n```\r\nmessage DatabaseCreateRequest {\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  // Optional aggregated namespace to create in \r\n  // addition to unaggregated namespace\r\n  AggregatedNamespace aggregated_namespace = 8;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- **M3DB**: Minimal configuration file with default settings looks like:\r\n```\r\ncoordinator: {}\r\ndb: {}\r\n```\r\nand includes common settings such as global query limits.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n- **M3DB**: `db.bootstrap.bootstrappers` removed\r\n- **M3DB**: `db.config` nested under `db.discovery.config` (`discovery` can optionally accept different `type`s of defaults instead of a custom `config`)\r\n- **M3DB**: `db.fs` config key renamed to `db.filesystem`\r\n- **M3DB**: `db.writeNewSeriesLimitPerSecond` config key nested under `db.limits` as `db.limits.writeNewSeriesPerSecond`\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: `cluster.namespaces.storageMetricsType` removed\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: `tagOptions.tagOptions` no longer supports `legacy` type\r\n- **M3Query**: `limits.perQuery.maxComputedDatapoints` removed\r\n- **M3Query**: `limits.perQuery.maxFetchedDatapoints` removed\r\n- **M3Query**: `limits.global.maxFetchedDatapoints` removed\r\n- **M3Query**: `cache` removed\r\n- **M3Query**: `listenAddress` changed to always be resolved as a string from config. Format changed from\r\n```\r\nlistenAddress:\r\n  config: \"...\"\r\n  value: \"...\"\r\n```\r\nto \r\n```\r\nlistenAddress: \"...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- **M3DB**: `/services/m3db/database/config/bootstrappers` dynamic bootstappers endpoint removed\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Removed deprecated URL `/api/v1/namespace` in favor of stable preferred URL `/api/v1/services/m3db/namespace`\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Removed deprecated URL `/api/v1/namespace/init` in favor of stable preferred URL `/api/v1/services/m3db/namespace/init`\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Removed deprecated URL `/api/v1/namespace/unagg` in favor of stable preferred URL `/api/v1/services/m3db/namespace/unagg`\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Removed deprecated URL `/api/v1/placement` in favor of stable preferred URL `/api/v1/services/m3db/placement`\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Removed deprecated URL `/api/v1/placement/init` in favor of stable preferred URL `/api/v1/services/m3db/placement/init`\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- **M3Query**: Concept of data point limit enforcers removed in favor of the other remaining query limits (e.g. max series). This also removed metrics `cost_reporter_datapoints`, `cost_reporter_datapoints_counter`, and `cost_reporter_over_datapoints_limit`.", "created_at": "2020-11-12T20:29:37Z", "project": "M3", "repo": "m3db/m3", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-30T13:11:37Z"}, {"name": "KubeEdge v1.5.0 release", "tag_name": "v1.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/releases/tag/v1.5.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge", "body": "See [CHANGELOG-1.5.md](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.5.md) for details.", "created_at": "2020-11-12T14:39:32Z", "project": "KubeEdge", "repo": "kubeedge/kubeedge", "type": "Edge", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.18.12", "tag_name": "v1.18.12", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.18.12", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes", "body": "See [kubernetes-announce@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce) and [CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v11812) for details.\n\nSHA256 for `kubernetes.tar.gz`: `e020b9682bc80e289b0e3bf79bdef2fba1da5fc8402b17b4adef702602108089`\nSHA512 for `kubernetes.tar.gz`: `29a844663c1afec7f555b781a152e7892878b13f6f9438d8064b6cbe771451da7b314b4aaee2817780c626099d265239f3fea6ff0cffbd7653d7fd43e5c03269`\n\nAdditional binary downloads are linked in the [CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#downloads-for-v11812).", "created_at": "2020-11-12T09:10:25Z", "project": "Kubernetes", "repo": "kubernetes/kubernetes", "type": "Orchestration", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "kustomize/v3.8.7", "tag_name": "kustomize/v3.8.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize/v3.8.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "body": "\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nad092cc7 Merge pull request #3216 from monopole/pin_api_v0.6.5\r\n0a9fc6c8 Pin to api_v0.6.5\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-11T23:13:34Z", "project": "Kustomize", "repo": "kubernetes-sigs/kustomize", "type": "Config", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Helm v3.4.1", "tag_name": "v3.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/helm/helm", "body": "Helm v3.4.1 is a patch release.

the default HTTP configuration values for the S3 client to the upstream Thanos default values. #3244\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.idle-conn-timeout` is set 90 seconds.\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.response-header-timeout` is set to 2 minutes.\r\n* [CHANGE] Improved shuffle sharding support in the write path. This work introduced some config changes: #3090\r\n  * Introduced `-distributor.sharding-strategy` CLI flag (and its respective `sharding_strategy` YAML config option) to explicitly specify which sharding strategy should be used in the write path\r\n  * `-experimental.distributor.user-subring-size` flag renamed to `-distributor.ingestion-tenant-shard-size`\r\n  * `user_subring_size` limit YAML config option renamed to `ingestion_tenant_shard_size`\r\n* [CHANGE] Dropped \"blank Alertmanager configuration; using fallback\" message from Info to Debug level. #3205\r\n* [CHANGE] Zone-awareness replication for time-series now should be explicitly enabled in the distributor via the `-distributor.zone-awareness-enabled` CLI flag (or its respective YAML config option). Before, zone-aware replication was implicitly enabled if a zone was set on ingesters. #3200\r\n* [CHANGE] Removed the deprecated CLI flag `-config-yaml`. You should use `-schema-config-file` instead. #3225\r\n* [CHANGE] Enforced the HTTP method required by some API endpoints which did (incorrectly) allow any method before that. #3228\r\n  - `GET /`\r\n  - `GET /config`\r\n  - `GET /debug/fgprof`\r\n  - `GET /distributor/all_user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /distributor/ha_tracker`\r\n  - `GET /all_user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /ha-tracker`\r\n  - `GET /api/v1/user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /api/v1/chunks`\r\n  - `GET <legacy-http-prefix>/user_stats`\r\n  - `GET <legacy-http-prefix>/chunks`\r\n  - `GET /services`\r\n  - `GET /multitenant_alertmanager/status`\r\n  - `GET /status` (alertmanager microservice)\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /store-gateway/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /compactor/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/flush`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/shutdown`\r\n  - `GET|POST /flush`\r\n  - `GET|POST /shutdown`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ruler/ring`\r\n  - `POST /api/v1/push`\r\n  - `POST <legacy-http-prefix>/push`\r\n  - `POST /push`\r\n  - `POST /ingester/push`\r\n* [CHANGE] Renamed CLI flags to configure the network interface names from which automatically detect the instance IP. #3295\r\n  - `-compactor.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-compactor.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-distributor.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-distributor.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-ruler.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-ruler.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n* [CHANGE] Renamed `-<prefix>.redis.enable-tls` CLI flag to `-<prefix>.redis.tls-enabled`, and its respective YAML config option from `enable_tls` to `tls_enabled`. #3298\r\n* [CHANGE] Increased default `-<prefix>.redis.timeout` from `100ms` to `500ms`. #3301\r\n* [CHANGE] `cortex_alertmanager_config_invalid` has been removed in favor of `cortex_alertmanager_config_last_reload_successful`. #3289\r\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: POST requests whose body size exceeds 10MiB will be rejected. The max body size can be customised via `-frontend.max-body-size`. #3276\r\n* [FEATURE] Shuffle sharding: added support for shuffle-sharding queriers in the query-frontend. When configured (`-frontend.max-queriers-per-tenant` globally, or using per-tenant limit `max_queriers_per_tenant`), each tenants's requests will be handled by different set of queriers. #3113 #3257\r\n* [FEATURE] Shuffle sharding: added support for shuffle-sharding ingesters on the read path. When ingesters shuffle-sharding is enabled and `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period` is set, queriers will fetch in-memory series from the minimum set of required ingesters, selecting only ingesters which may have received series since 'now - lookback period'. #3252\r\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: added `compression` config to support results cache with compression. #3217\r\n* [FEATURE] Add OpenStack Swift support to blocks storage. #3303\r\n* [FEATURE] Added support for applying Prometheus relabel configs on series received by the distributor. A `metric_relabel_configs` field has been added to the per-tenant limits configuration. #3329\r\n* [FEATURE] Support for Cassandra client SSL certificates. #3384\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Introduces two new limits `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group` and `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant` to control the number of rules per rule group and the total number of rule groups for a given user. They are disabled by default. #3366\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow to specify multiple comma-separated Cortex services to `-target` CLI option (or its respective YAML config option). For example, `-target=all,compactor` can be used to start Cortex single-binary with compactor as well. #3275\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose additional HTTP configs for the S3 backend client. New flag are listed below: #3244\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.idle-conn-timeout`\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.response-header-timeout`\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.insecure-skip-verify`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `cortex_query_frontend_connected_clients` metric to show the number of workers currently connected to the frontend. #3207\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Shuffle sharding: improved shuffle sharding in the write path. Shuffle sharding now should be explicitly enabled via `-distributor.sharding-strategy` CLI flag (or its respective YAML config option) and guarantees stability, consistency, shuffling and balanced zone-awareness properties. #3090 #3214\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added new metric `cortex_ingester_active_series` to track active series more accurately. Also added options to control whether active series tracking is enabled (`-ingester.active-series-enabled`, defaults to false), and how often this metric is updated (`-ingester.active-series-update-period`) and max idle time for series to be considered inactive (`-ingester.active-series-idle-timeout`). #3153\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added zone-aware replication support to blocks replication in the store-gateway. #3200\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: exported new metrics. #3231\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_store_cached_series_fetch_duration_seconds`\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_store_cached_postings_fetch_duration_seconds`\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_stores_gate_queries_max`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `-version` flag to Cortex. #3233\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Hash ring: added instance registered timestamp to the ring. #3248\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce tail latency by smoothing out spikes in rate of chunk flush operations. #3191\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] User Cortex as User Agent in http requests issued by Configs DB client. #3264\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Experimental Ruler API: Fetch rule groups from object storage in parallel. #3218\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Chunks GCS object storage client uses the `fields` selector to limit the payload size when listing objects in the bucket. #3218 #3292\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added shuffle sharding support to ruler. Added new metric `cortex_ruler_sync_rules_total`. #3235\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Return an explicit error when the store-gateway is explicitly requested without a blocks storage engine. #3287\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: only load rules that belong to the ruler. Improves rules synching performances when ruler sharding is enabled. #3269\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `-<prefix>.redis.tls-insecure-skip-verify` flag. #3298\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `cortex_alertmanager_config_last_reload_successful_seconds` metric to show timestamp of last successful AM config reload. #3289\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: reduced number of bucket listing operations to list block content (applies to newly created blocks only). #3363\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Include the tenant ID on the notifier logs. #3372\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage Compactor: Added `-compactor.enabled-tenants` and `-compactor.disabled-tenants` to explicitly enable or disable compaction of specific tenants. #3385\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage ingester: Creating checkpoint only once even when there are multiple Head compactions in a single `Compact()` call. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage ingester: Read repair memory-mapped chunks file which can end up being empty on abrupt shutdowns combined with faulty disks. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage ingester: Close TSDB resources on failed startup preventing ingester OOMing. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] No-longer-needed ingester operations for queries triggered by queriers and rulers are now canceled. #3178\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: directories in the configured `rules-path` will be removed on startup and shutdown in order to ensure they don't persist between runs. #3195\r\n* [BUGFIX] Handle hash-collisions in the query path. #3192\r\n* [BUGFIX] Check for postgres rows errors. #3197\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler Experimental API: Don't allow rule groups without names or empty rule groups. #3210\r\n* [BUGFIX] Experimental Alertmanager API: Do not allow empty Alertmanager configurations or bad template filenames to be submitted through the configuration API. #3185\r\n* [BUGFIX] Reduce failures to update heartbeat when using Consul. #3259\r\n* [BUGFIX] When using ruler sharding, moving all user rule groups from ruler to a different one and then back could end up with some user groups not being evaluated at all. #3235\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed shuffle sharding consistency when zone-awareness is enabled and the shard size is increased or instances in a new zone are added. #3299\r\n* [BUGFIX] Use a valid grpc header when logging IP addresses. #3307\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed the metric `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_duration_seconds` in the Ruler, it wouldn't report any values. #3310\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed gRPC connections leaking in rulers when rulers sharding is enabled and APIs called. #3314\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed shuffle sharding consistency when zone-awareness is enabled and the shard size is increased or instances in a new zone are added. #3299\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed Gossip memberlist members joining when addresses are configured using DNS-based service discovery. #3360\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fail to start an ingester running the blocks storage, if unable to load any existing TSDB at startup. #3354\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: Avoid deletion of blocks in the ingester which are not shipped to the storage yet. #3346\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fix common prefixes returned by List method of S3 client. #3358\r\n* [BUGFIX] Honor configured timeout in Azure and GCS object clients. #3285\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: Avoid creating blocks larger than configured block range period on forced compaction and when TSDB is idle. #3344\r\n* [BUGFIX] Shuffle sharding: fixed max global series per user/metric limit when shuffle sharding and `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=true` are both enabled in distributor. When using these global limits you should now set `-distributor.sharding-strategy` and `-distributor.zone-awareness-enabled` to ingesters too. #3369\r\n* [BUGFIX] Slow query logging: when using downstream server request parameters were not logged. #3276\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed tenant detection in the ruler and alertmanager API when running without auth. #3343\r\n\r\n### Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Builder: download plan file locally before processing it. #3209\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Cleaner: added new tool for deleting chunks data. #3283\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: support for scanning specific date-range only. #3222\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: metrics for tracking progress. #3222\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Builder: retry block upload before giving up. #3245\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: upload plans concurrently. #3340\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocksconvert: fix chunks ordering in the block. Chunks in different order than series work just fine in TSDB blocks at the moment, but it's not consistent with what Prometheus does and future Prometheus and Cortex optimizations may rely on this ordering. #3371", "created_at": "2020-11-09T18:15:27Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.2.0", "tag_name": "v1.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk", "body": "### Additions\r\n\r\n- Enabled definition of custom categories encoded as [JSON file(s)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/tasks/validate-package/#validation) for the `operatorhub` validator.

The example YAML has been updated to configure Envoy to use the v3 protocol by default.\r\n\r\nWhen users have an existing Contour installation and wish to upgrade without dropping connections, users should first upgrade Contour  to v1.10.0 which will serve both v2 and v3 xDS versions from the same gRPC endpoint. Next, change the Envoy Daemonset or deployment to include `--xds-resource-version=v3` as an argument in the `envoy-initconfig` init container, which tells Envoy to upgrade to the `v3` resource version. The usual rollout process will handle draining connections allowing a fleet of Envoy instances to move from the v2 xDS Resource API version gradually to the v3 version.\r\n\r\nSee the xDS Migration guide for more information: https://projectcontour.io/guides/xds-migration/\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #1898, #2930, #3016, #3017, #3068, #3079, #3074, #3087, #3093\r\n\r\nThanks to @stevesloka and @jpeach for their hard work on this upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Custom JSON fields for Envoy access logs\r\nContour now supports custom JSON fields in the Envoy access log. Custom fields can be specified in the `json-fields` config field, using the format `<custom-field-name>=<Envoy format string>`, where the Envoy format string can contain [any Envoy command operator](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/observability/access_log/usage#command-operators) except `DYNAMIC_METADATA` and `FILTER_STATE`. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about this feature in Contour's [updated guide to structured logging](https://projectcontour.io/guides/structured-logs/).\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #3059, #3032, #1507\r\n\r\nThanks to @Mike1808, @KauzClay, and @XanderStrike for designing and implementing this feature!\r\n\r\n## Multi-arch Docker images\r\nContour's Docker images are now multi-architecture, with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` currently supported. No change is needed by users; the correct architecture will be automatically be pulled for your host.\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #3031, #2868\r\n\r\nThanks to @skriss for implementing multi-arch support.\r\n\r\n## Envoy 1.16\r\n\r\nContour now uses Envoy 1.16.0.\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #3029, #3013\r\n\r\nThanks to @yoitsro for this upgrade!\r\n\r\n## Default minimum TLS version is now 1.2\r\n\r\nTLS 1.2 is now the default minimum TLS version for `HTTPProxies` and `Ingresses`. It's still possible to use 1.1 if necessary by explicitly specifying it. See the [HTTPProxy documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.10.0/config/tls-termination/) and [Ingress documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.10.0/config/annotations/#contour-specific-ingress-annotations) for more information.\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #3007, #2777, #3012\r\n\r\nThanks to @skriss for making this change.\r\n\r\n## RBAC v1\r\n\r\nContour's example YAML now uses `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` instead of the deprecated `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` version for role-based access control (RBAC) resources. RBAC has been generally available in Kubernetes since v1.8, so this has no effect on the minimum supported Kubernetes version.\r\n\r\nRelated issues and PRs: #3015, #2991\r\n\r\nThanks to @narahari92 for this upgrade!\r\n\r\n# Deprecation & Removal Notices\r\n- The `request-timeout` field has been removed from the config file. This field was moved into the timeouts block, i.e. `timeouts.request-timeout`, in Contour 1.7.\r\n- In Contour 1.11, TLS 1.1 will be disabled by default. Users who require TLS 1.1 will have to enable it via the config file's `tls.minimum-protocol-version` field, and by specifying it for each `HTTPProxy` or `Ingress` where it's needed. See the [HTTPProxy documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.10.0/config/tls-termination/) and [Ingress documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.10.0/config/annotations/#contour-specific-ingress-annotations) for more information.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\nPlease consult the upgrade [documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n# Are you a Contour user? We would love to know!\r\nIf you're using Contour and want to add your organization to our adopters list, please visit this [page](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md). If you prefer to keep your organization name anonymous but still give us feedback into your usage and scenarios for Contour, please post on this [GitHub

If you are happy with the help you've had these last over 5 years, please ensure you've [starred our repo](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/stargazers) or drop by to say thanks on [gitter](https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin).\r\n\r\nIf you have time to help us continue to serve others, please stop by on gitter with a suggestion of what you'd like to help with or a request for what might be a neat way to start. Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images.

They should be reviewed carefully so that client code can be changed in concert with a Vitess release deployment.\r\n* Change error code from 1203 to 1153 for three specific error conditions. #6630\r\n  The three errors being changed:\r\nWhen a GRPC message coming back to the vtgate exceeds the configured size limit (configured via grpc_max_message_size)\r\nIf a write is attempting to make a change with a payload that is larger than the configured allowable size\r\nIf a scatter query is attempting to collect and process too many rows in memory within the vtgate to construct a response\r\n* Zero auto-increment mode: This enables inserting a 0 value (and not just NULL) into an auto-increment column to generate sequence values. This matches the default behavior of MySQL. #6749\r\n* Turn off schema tracker by default #6712\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n### VTGate / MySQL compatibility\r\n* Fix where clause in information schema

Consequently, the SSH user changed to `ubuntu` and the Linux kernel changed to version 5.4.\r\n\r\n* To address the [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) of IPv4 only clusters being susceptible to MitM attacks via IPv6 rogue router advertisements, the affected components have been upgraded as follows:\r\n    * Docker version 19.03.11 - [CVE-2020-13401](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/v19.03.11)\r\n    * CNI plugins 0.8.6 - [CVE-2020-10749](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/tag/v0.8.6)\r\n    * Calico 3.15.1 - [CVE-2020-13597](https://www.projectcalico.org/security-bulletins/)\r\n    * Weave Net 2.6.5 - [CVE-2020-11091](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/security/advisories/GHSA-59qg-grp7-5r73)\r\n\r\n* Support for [RHEL 8](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#rhel-8) and [CentOS 8](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#centos-8) has been added.\r\n\r\n* Support for [Amazon Linux 2](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#amazon-linux-2) has been improved and will work with the default Docker version.\r\n\r\n* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md) has been added and can be selected as an alternate container runtime for Kubernetes. Enable by using the `--container-runtime containerd` flag when creating a cluster or by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd`.\r\n\r\n* Rolling updates now support surging and parallelism within an instance group. For details see [the documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/rolling-update/).\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use AWS networking natively through the AWS ENI IPAM mode. Kops can also run a Kubernetes cluster entirely without kube-proxy using Cilium's BPF NodePort implementation.\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use a dedicated etcd cluster managed by etcd-manager for synchronizing agent state instead of CRDs.\r\n\r\n* The Terraform target now supports Terraform 0.12 syntax (HCL2) by default. See the Required Actions item below.\r\n\r\n* New clusters in GCE are configured to run the [metadata-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metadata-proxy) by default. The proxy runs as a DaemonSet and lands on nodes with the nodeLabel `cloud.google.com/metadata-proxy-ready: \"true\"`. If you want to enable metadata-proxy on an existing cluster/instance group, add that nodeLabel to your instancegroup specs (`kops edit ig ...`) and run `kops update cluster`. When the changes are applied, the proxy will roll out to those targeted nodes.\r\n\r\n* GCE has a new flag: `--gce-service-account`. This takes the email of an existing GCP service account and launches the instances with it. This setting applies to the whole cluster (ie: it is not currently designed to support Instance Groups with different service accounts). If you do not specify a service account during cluster creation, the default compute service account will be used which matches the prior behavior.\r\n\r\n* Google API client libraries updated from v0.beta to v1.\r\n\r\n* Support for [NodeLocalDNS cache](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cluster_spec/#node-local-dns-cache).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker versions 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 has been removed because of the [dockerproject.org shut down](https://www.docker.com/blog/changes-dockerproject-org-apt-yum-repositories/). Those affected must upgrade to a newer Docker version.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename some resources in their state file in order to prepare for Terraform 0.12 support. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the CoreOS OS distribution has been removed. Users should consider Flatcar as a replacement.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Debian 8 (Jessie) OS distribution has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Docker `health-check` service has been disabled by default. It shouldn't be needed anymore, but it can still be enabled by setting `spec.docker.healthCheck: true`. It is recommended to also check [node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) and [draino](https://github.com/planetlabs/draino) as replacements. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Network and internet access for `docker run` containers has been disabled by default, to avoid any unwanted interaction between the Docker firewall rules and the firewall rules of netwok plugins. This was the default since the early days of Kops, but a race condition in the Docker startup sequence changed this behaviour in more recent years. To re-enable, set `spec.docker.ipTables: true` and `spec.docker.ipMasq: true`.\r\n\r\n* Lyft CNI plugin default subnet tags changed from from `Type: pod` to `KubernetesCluster: myclustername.mydns.io`. Subnets intended for use by the plugin will need to be tagged with this new tag and [additional tag filters](https://github.com/lyft/cni-ipvlan-vpc-k8s#other-configuration-flags) may need to be added to the cluster spec in order to achieve the desired set of subnets.\r\n\r\n* Support for basic authentication has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and will be [removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89069) in Kubernetes 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for static tokens has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and later. To re-enable, see the [Security Notes for Kubernetes](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/security/#api-bearer-token). We intend to remove support entirely in a future kops version, so file an issue with your use case if you need this feature. \r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the \"Legacy\" etcd provider has been removed for Kubernetes versions 1.18 and higher. Such clusters will need to migrate to the default \"Manager\" etcd provider. To migrate, see the [etcd migration documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/etcd3-migration/).\r\n\r\n* A controller is now used to apply labels to nodes.  If you are not using AWS, GCE or OpenStack your (non-master) nodes may not have labels applied correctly.\r\n\r\n* The `kops.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API has been removed. Users of `kops replace` will need to supply v1alpha2 resources.\r\n\r\n* Please see the notes in the 1.15 release about the apiGroup changing from kops to kops.k8s.io\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename resources in their terraform state file in order to support Terraform 0.12.\r\n  Terraform 0.12 [no longer supports resource names starting with digits](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html#pre-upgrade-checklist). In Kops, both the default route and additional VPC CIDR associations are affected. See [#7957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/7957) for more information.\r\n  * The default route was named `aws_route.0-0-0-0--0` and will now be named `aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0`.\r\n  * Additional CIDR blocks associated with a VPC were similarly named the hyphenated CIDR block with two hyphens for the `/`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16`. These will now be prefixed with `cidr-`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16`.\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```\r\n  KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=-Terraform-0.12 kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform <0.12\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Observe any aws_route or aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association resources being destroyed and recreated\r\n  # Run these commands as necessary. The exact names may differ; use what is outputted by terraform plan\r\n  terraform state mv aws_route.0-0-0-0--0 aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0\r\n  terraform state mv aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16 aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n  Kops will now output Terraform 0.12 syntax with the normal workflow:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform 0.12. This plan should be a no-op\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Users that need the Docker `health-check` service will need to explicitly enable it:\r\n```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    docker:\r\n      healthCheck: true\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. This is required for newer versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n  To enable the Pod priority feature, follow these steps:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    kubelet:\r\n      featureGates:\r\n        PodPriority: \"true\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If a custom Kops build was used on a cluster, a kops-controller Deployment may have been created that should get deleted.\r\n  Run `kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment kops-controller` after upgrading to Kops 1.16.0-beta.1 or later.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n* AWS clusters with an ACM certificate attached to the API ELB (the cluster's `spec.api.loadBalancer.sslCertificate` is set) will need to reenable basic auth to use the kubeconfig context created by `kops export kubecfg`. Set `spec.kubeAPIServer.disableBasicAuth: false` before running `kops export kubecfg`. See [#9756](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9756) for more information.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.9 and 1.10 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## All changes from 1.18.1 to 1.18.2\r\n\r\n* Add missing spot support to launch template direct render [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#9897](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9897)\r\n* NodeLocalDNS config population: small tweaks [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb),[@commixon](https://github.com/commixon),[@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9376](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9376)\r\n* Detect AWS region for S3 inside containers [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9857](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9857)\r\n* Get launch template versions after filtering templates [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#9909](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9909)\r\n* Only apply external policies when these are defined [@kesor](https://github.com/kesor),[@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#9867](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9867)\r\n* kops/cmd: add sshAccess to be recognized for the kops set cluster command [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato) [#10034](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10034)\r\n* Allow upgrades when IG image is Ubuntu 20.04 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#10035](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10035)\r\n* Add support for KubeAPIServer --request-timeout flag [@dntosas](https://github.com/dntosas) [#10038](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10038)\r\n* Add WireGuard support for Calico CNI  [@h3poteto](https://github.com/h3poteto) [#10037](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10037)\r\n* Don't require PriorityClassName to pass missing-static-pod checks [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#10049](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10049)\r\n* Remove force_tcp flag for nodelocalcache dot zone [@astrikos](https://github.com/astrikos) [#9917](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9917)\r\n* Simplify node local dns [@olemarkus](https://github.com/olemarkus) [#10059](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/10059)\r\n\r\nPlease see the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/releases/1.18-NOTES.md) for the full list of changes. \r\n", "created_at": "2020-10-24T13:51:55Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.18.4", "tag_name": "v1.18.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/releases/tag/v1.18.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o", "body": "# CRI-O v1.18.4\r\n\r\nThe release notes have been generated for the commit range\r\n[v1.18.3...v1.18.4](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/compare/v1.18.3...v1.18.4) on Fri, 23 Oct 2020 01:00:38 UTC.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nDownload the static release bundle via our Google Cloud Bucket:\r\n[crio-v1.18.4.tar.gz][0]\r\n\r\n[0]: https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-conform-cri-o/artifacts/crio-v1.18.4.tar.gz\r\n\r\n## Changes by Kind\r\n\r\n### Other (Bug, Cleanup or Flake)\r\n\r\n- Fixed regression where it was not able to run exec any more when compiling CRI-O with newer go versions ([#4192](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4192), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n- Fix a bug where a sudden reboot causes incomplete image writes.

release.\r\nIt focuses on bug fixes and usability improvements.\r\n\r\nThis release [**no longer supports** Erlang 21.3](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/v3K5nZNsfwM).\r\n\r\n### Erlang 23 Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis release is [compatible](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/wlPIWz3UYHQ) with [Erlang 23](http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-23-Highlights/).\r\n\r\n### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\nThis release [**requires Erlang/OTP 22.0**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.\r\n`22.3` or `23.0` releases are recommended.\r\n\r\n[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains\r\nwhat package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `22.3.x`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log\r\n\r\nSee [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and\r\ncompatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release series (e.g. `3.7.x`).\r\n\r\nSee the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and\r\n[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading to Erlang 22.x or Later Versions\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to this release from `3.7.15` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.\r\n\r\nBecause older RabbitMQ CLI tools can be incompatible with Erlang 22+ releases,\r\nRabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` on Erlang 21.3 first,\r\nthen Erlang 22.x or 23.x, then RabbitMQ to most recent 3.8.x release.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nAny questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Starting with `3.8.0`, an unintentionally introduced assertion could prevent classic mirrored queue\r\n   mirrors from starting successfully in case the primary replica changed concurrently with their startup.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2449](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2449)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Raft implementation's [failure detector](https://github.com/rabbitmq/aten) default polling interval has been increased from 1s to 5s.\r\n   The previously used default results in too frequent leader elections in networks with high packet loss\r\n   (say, double digit percent).\r\n\r\n   This has no correctness or safety ramifications, however, automated tests that assert on Raft properties\r\n   or expect a very fast leader re-election may have to set it back so that peer failures are detected quicker.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2450](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2450)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The now deprecated intrusive health check endpoint, `GET /api/healthchecks/node`, reported failures in the response\r\n   but always set the status to `200 OK`. It now uses the status of `500` in case of a failure.\r\n\r\n   [RabbitMQ Monitoring guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#health-checks) explains why\r\n   this health check is no longer recommended and what the alternatives are.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#840](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/840)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * When a client doubly encodes a request into JSON, the plugin tries to detect that and will produce a more\r\n   helpful 400 response instead of a 500.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#839](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/839)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When a classic mirrored queue with a replica on every cluster node (this is [highly discouraged](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#replication-factor)) was federated,\r\n   multiple links could be started by the plugin, potentially making message transfers concurrent\r\n   and affecting ordering.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#114](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/114)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * It is now possible to federate exchanges in different virtual hosts in the same cluster for more than one hop.\r\n   For example, federate messages from an exchange in virtual host B to C, while B itself is federated from\r\n   virtual host A. Previously such messages would have been filtered by the message cycle detection algorithm\r\n   which assumed that exchanges are only federated across clusters.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#116](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/116)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Kubernetes API events registered by this plugin mixed up reason and message fields.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by Gabriele Santomaggio.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s#70](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s/pull/70)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 AuthN/AuthZ Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Improved compatibility with Azure AD. This plugin can now be configured to fetch scopes from a non-standard\r\n   field in the decoded token value (other than the standard `scopes` field).\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @Robert-Gustafsson.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#53](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/pull/53)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source code archives\r\n\r\n**Warning**: The source code archive provided by GitHub only contains the source of the broker, not the plugins or the client libraries.\r\nPlease download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.8.9.tar.xz`.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-09-24T17:48:15Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.27.4", "tag_name": "1.27.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose", "body": "# Bugs\r\n\r\n- Remove path checks for bind mounts\r\n\r\n- Fix port rendering to output long form syntax for non-v1\r\n\r\n- Add protocol to the docker socket address", "created_at": "2020-09-24T15:17:20Z", "project": "Docker-compose", "repo": "docker/compose", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.6", "tag_name": "v1.0.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly/releases/tag/v1.0.6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly", "body": "support preheat for register.

The Kubernetes project only supports `v1.16+` currently.\r\n  - **UPDATE**:  Kubernetes `v1.14+` is required for multi-node clusters. See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/1744#issuecomment-692905480\r\n- Building Kubernetes with bazel will only work with Kubernetes `v1.15+`\r\n  - Building without bazel still works back to `v1.13.0`\r\n- `v1alpha3` kind config is no longer supported. Please upgrade to `v1alpha4` (which was already the current version in previous releases)\r\n- Capital letters in cluster names are explicitly rejected by kind, in order to prevent encountering upstream issues with name validation\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: If you are hitting `label key and value greater than maximum size (4096 bytes), key: containerd: invalid argument` (https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1572), then try the following KIND config:\r\n```\r\nkind: Cluster\r\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\r\ncontainerdConfigPatches:\r\n- |-\r\n  [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd]\r\n  disable_snapshot_annotations = true\r\n```\r\nSee: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#getting-started for how to use a KIND config file.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- NFS volumes should now work\r\n- Kubernetes RuntimeConfig is now first class in kind config\r\n- Upgraded dependencies across the board\r\n- Nodes now have a tenative providerID value set.

You can now manage the deployment of applications atop Kubernetes clusters using the familiar Portainer UX. This release is a big one & introduces a total of 101 changes to Portainer, meaning it needs to be tested in your environment before upgrading your production instances of Portainer 1.xx to Portainer 2.0.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** There are a number of breaking changes, and changes to functionality that require analysis, specifically a re-engineering of the application templates feature, removal of support for VMWare VIC, and removal of support for externally defined endpoints.\r\n\r\nIF YOU ARE RUNNING A \"HISTORIC\" VERSION OF PORTAINER (IE OLDER AND 1.23.X) PLEASE EITHER FIRST UPGRADE TO 1.24.1 AND/OR BACKUP YOUR PORTAINER.DB FILE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO UPGRADE TO CE 2.0; THERE ARE REPORTED ISSUES OF DB CORRUPTION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO UPGRADE FROM SUCH AND OLD VERSION TO LATEST IN ONE STEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* We have released CE 2.0 as `portainer/portainer-ce` to ensure auto-updaters (like watchtower) don't expose users to risks by automatically updating on release.\r\n* Extensions have now been removed; there is now no ability to use RBAC, Registry Manager, or External Authentication extensions in CE 2.0 (Extension customers will be communicated directly with a free license for the upcoming Portainer Business Edition). **EXTENSION USERS, DO NOT UPGRADE TO PORTAINER CE 2.0**\r\n* Port 8000 is now exposed by default. Reverse proxy configurations that don't specify a port for the load balancer will now likely need to do so: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3963\r\n* The `--no-auth` flag was removed as part of support for setting a custom timeout: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3846\r\n* Support for external endpoints has been removed along with the `--external-endpoints` flag. **WARNING:** migrating to this version with external endpoints defined will render them un-manageable: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3832\r\n* Support for VIC environments has been removed: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3834\r\n* The `--no-snapshot` flag has been removed, instances migrating with this flag will revert to default snapshot interval: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3804\r\n* Host jobs are now an edge-exclusive feature: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3745\r\n* The `--no-analytics` flag will be kept to allow migration of instances running a previous version of Portainer with this flag enabled, to version 2.0 where enabling this flag will have no effect.\r\n* Changed templates syntax to support versioning, a migration tool can be found [here](https://github.com/portainer/helper-templates) for your convenience:  https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3708\r\n* The `--sync-interval` flag was removed as part of the removal of external endpoints: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3832\r\n* Removed template management features & the `--templates-file` flag. **NOTE:** Users will no longer be able to create container templates via UI: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3707\r\n\r\n## Security:\r\n* Enforced the security setting \"disable the use of bind mounts\" when set via API:  https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106\r\n* Disabled Container Capabilities for non-admins: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4105\r\n* Enforce use

https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4065\r\n* Disabled ability for a regular user to re-create/edit/duplicate containers if a related security setting is enabled: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4069\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes:\r\n* Introduce support for Kubernetes: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/1637\r\n* Added the ability to apply taints and labels to nodes: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4005\r\n* Added the ability to expose an application via ingress: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4004\r\n*

our own custom telemetry leveraging Matomo: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3742\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of GDPR rules and the GDPR compliance recommendations provided by Matomo (the telemetry tool we are using for analytics) it was determined we will use the opt-out data collection mechanism. The reason for this assessment is that we are not collecting **ANY** personally identifiable data (all data is anonymized), and the data we collect is solely for our Legitimate business interests, and is not sold or provided to any 3rd parties.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity, we do not collect **ANY** user identifiable or personal information at any time, all statistics collected are anonymous and we have no way of identifying the Portainer instances reporting, nor the users using the application.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE ALSO NOTE:** The `--no-analytics` flag will be kept to allow migration of instances running a previous version of Portainer with this flag enabled, to version 2.0 where enabling this flag will have no effect.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to our [updated privacy policy](https://www.portainer.io/documentation/in-app-analytics-and-privacy-policy/)\r\n\r\n## Authentication & UAC:\r\n* Integrated the external authentication extension:
