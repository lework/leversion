11.0.0", "tag_name": "v11.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v11.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport", "body": "Teleport 11 brings the following new major features and improvements:\r\n\r\n- Hardware-backed private keys support for Server Access (Enterprise only).\r\n- Replacement of obsolete SCP protocol with SFTP for Server Access.\r\n- Removal of persistent storage requirement for Helm charts.\r\n- Automatic discovery and enrollment of EKS/AKS clusters for Kubernetes Access.\r\n- Richer Azure integrations for Server and Database Access.\r\n- Cassandra and Scylla support for Database Access, including AWS Keyspaces.\r\n- GitHub Actions and Terraform support for Machine ID.\r\n- Access Requests and file upload/download support for Teleport Connect.\r\n\r\n### Hardware-backed private keys (Enterprise Only)\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 clients (such as tsh or Connect) support storing their private key\r\nmaterial on Yubikey devices instead of filesystem which helps prevent\r\ncredentials exfiltration attacks.\r\n\r\nSee how to enable it in this guide:\r\n\r\nhttps://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support/\r\n\r\nHardware-backed private keys is an enterprise only feature, and is currently\r\nsupported for Server Access only.\r\n\r\n### SFTP protocol\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 adds server-side support for SFTP protocol which many IDEs such as\r\nVSCode or JetBrains PyCharm, GoLand and others use for browsing, copying, and\r\nediting files on remote systems.\r\n\r\nThe following guides explain how to use IDEs to connect to a remote machine via\r\nTeleport:\r\n\r\nhttps://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/vscode/\r\nhttps://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/jetbrains-sftp/\r\n\r\nIn addition, Teleport 11 clients will use SFTP protocol for file transfer under\r\nthe hood instead of the obsolete scp protocol. Server-side scp is still\r\nsupported so existing clients aren\u2019t affected.\r\n\r\n### Helm charts persistent storage\r\n\r\nIn Teleport 11 users no longer need to use persistent storage when deploying\r\nHelm charts. When running on Kubernetes, Teleport services will now store their\r\nidentities in Kubernetes Secrets which removes the need for using persistent\r\nstorage or static join tokens.\r\n\r\nFor existing deployments, this change involves migration from Deployment to\r\nStatefulSet which is performed automatically during Helm upgrade to Teleport 11.\r\n\r\n### EKS/AKS discovery\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 adds support for automatic discovery and enrollment of AWS Elastic\r\nKubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.\r\n\r\n### Azure integrations\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 improves Azure support in multiple areas.\r\n\r\nTeleport agents running on Azure VMs will now automatically import Azure tags to\r\nlabel resources.\r\n\r\nTeleport Database Access now supports auto-discovery for Azure-hosted PostgreSQL\r\nand MySQL databases. See the updated Azure guide for more details:\r\nhttps://goteleport.com/docs/ver/11.0/database-access/guides/azure-postgres-mysql/.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Teleport Database Access will now use Azure AD managed identity\r\nauthentication for Azure-hosted SQL Server databases.\r\n\r\n### Cassandra/ScyllaDB\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 adds support for Cassandra and ScyllaDB databases in Database\r\nAccess. This includes support for AWS Keyspaces.\r\n\r\n### Machine ID\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 adds support for secret-less joining of Machine ID agents in GitHub\r\nActions workflows. See the guide for more details: TODO\r\n\r\nWe have also released a GitHub Action for setting up the Teleport binaries\r\nwithin a GitHub workflow environment. More details regarding this can be found\r\nat the Teleport GitHub Actions repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gravitational/teleport-actions\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Teleport Terraform plugin now supports the creation of Machine\r\nID Bots and Bot Tokens.\r\n\r\n### Teleport Connect\r\n\r\nTeleport Connect has added support for Access Requests and file upload/download.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nPlease familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in\r\nTeleport 11 before upgrading.\r\n\r\n#### Removed Github external SSO\r\n\r\nBeginning in Teleport 11, GitHub SAML SSO will only be available in our\r\nEnterprise Edition. GitHub SSO without SAML will continue to work with OSS\r\nTeleport.\r\n\r\nTo keep using GitHub SSO with the OSS Teleport, SAML SSO needs to be disabled\r\nfor your GitHub organization. OSS Teleport users can continue to use GitHub SSO\r\nif using a Github Free or Team GitHub Plan.\r\n\r\n#### Changed Terraform OIDC connector redirect_url type to array\r\n\r\nIn Teleport Plugins 11, `redirect_url` property in OIDC connectors created via\r\na Terraform module expects an array:\r\n\r\n```\r\nredirect_url = [ \"http://example.com\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Deprecated Quay.io registry\r\n\r\nStarting with Teleport 11, Quay.io as a container registry has been deprecated.\r\nCustomers should use the new AWS ECR registry to pull Teleport Docker images:\r\nhttps://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#docker.\r\n\r\nQuay.io registry support will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### Deprecated old deb/rpm repositories\r\n\r\nIn Teleport 11, old deb/rpm repositories (deb.releases.teleport.dev and\r\nrpm.releases.teleport.dev) have been deprecated. Customers should use the new\r\nrepositories (apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev) to\r\ninstall Teleport: https://goteleport.com/docs/installation/#linux.\r\n\r\nSupport for our old deb/rpm repositories will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### Changed teleport-kube-agent Helm chart to StatefulSet\r\n\r\nTeleport 11 agents will now store their identities in Kubernetes Secrets when\r\ndeployed via a Helm chart which eliminates the need for using persistent storage\r\nor static join tokens. Due to this change, Teleport agents are now always\r\ndeployed as part of StatefulSet regardless of whether persistent storage is\r\nenabled or not.\r\n\r\nExisting agents that were deployed as Kubernetes Deployments (i.e. without\r\npersistent storage) will be automatically converted to StatefulSets during\r\nTeleport 11 Helm upgrade.\r\n\r\n#### Removed PostgreSQL backend\r\n\r\nThe preview PostgreSQL backend was deleted due to performance and scalability\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n#### Removed Desktop Access support for 32-bit ARM and 386 architectures\r\n\r\n32-bit support for Desktop Access on ARM and 386 architectures has been removed\r\ndue to performance issues on these devices.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the binary size for these builds, making them slightly more\r\nconvenient for smaller resource-constrained devices.", "created_at": "2022-10-24T17:24:05Z", "project": "Teleport", "repo": "gravitational/teleport", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.25.0", "tag_name": "v1.25.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.25.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk", "body": "## v1.25.0\n\n### Changes\n\n- (ansible/v1): Modified ansible scaffolding in order to incorporate  changes with Kubebuilder on `--component-config` flag changes.  Previously, the changes with `--component-config` flag were not  considered by default.\nThe following are the modifications: 1. If the `--component-config` flag is passed then look for `- /manager`  in `manager.yaml` in order to add leader election id. If the component  config flag is not passed then check for `--leader-elect` flag. 2. In `manager_proxy_patch.yaml` file, look for `memory: 64Mi`  if the component flag is passed flag is passed. If not then look  for `--leader-elect`. 3. Repeat the same logic for replacing the port number from the file. 4. At the end, update the `manager.yaml` file to avoid lint errors. ([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- (go/v3, hybrid.helm/v1-alpha, and quarkus/v1-alpha): Upgrade Kubernetes dependencies from `1.24` to `1.25`. ([#6044](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6044))\n- This PR bumped Kubebuilder to 3.7.1,  with this version comes the addition of the `--component-config` flag.\nThis flag is passed through `operator-sdk init` command.  If this flag is passed through the command line as an argument then only the  `controller_manager_config.yaml` file will be scaffolded in the  manifest.  If it is not passed then it will not scaffold out this file.  The command for passing the flag is:  operator-sdk init --domain example.com --repo github.com/example/memcached-operator --component-config. ([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- (ansible/v1): updates the base ansible base operator event api, api server,  and proxy to now have a 5 second timeout when reading the request headers.  This is to prevent the possibility of a [Slowloris attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-attack-tools/slowloris/). ([#6088](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6088))\n- Modified go version to 1.19 and Kubebuilder to 3.7.1. The `config-gen` is  completely removed from Kubebuilder. As part of this bump, the  website content of SDK was updated where the doc is referring to  `config-gen`. ([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- Updated ginkgo to ginkgo/v2 in all of the files. ([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- Updated: - ginko to `ginko/v2` - `io/ioutil` packages to either `io` or `os` since its not longer supported in go1.19. ([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- (helm/v1): Modified helm scaffolding in order to incorporate changes with Kubebuilder on `--component-config` flag changes.

([#6047](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6047))\n- (ansible/v1, helm/v1): Added support to build multi-arch images from the project Makefile. A docker-buildx target will build the images for the platforms specified by the PLATFORMS variable. ([#6093](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6093))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- (docs) Update the go version in the developer guide.  The documentation wasn't updated when the go version was bumped to v1.18. ([#6101](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6101))\n- For operator-sdk run bundle and bundle-upgrade subcommands: Added --security-context-config flag to enable seccompprofile. It defaults to restricted to support k8s 1.25. You can disable it with --security-context-config=legacy.

CRI-O now logs the stage of container or pod creation under system load. This allows users to find why their creation requests are stalling. ([#6303](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6303), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - Fix CVE-2022-27652 by dropping and refusing to add any inheritable capabilities ([#5770](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5770), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where ExecSync requests (exec probes) could use an arbitrary amount of memory and disk. Output from ExecSync requests is now limited to 16MB (the amount that exec output was limited to in the dockershim). Disk limiting requires conmon 2.1.2 to work. See https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j and CVE-2022-1708 for more information. ([#5937](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5937), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a bug where child processes of containers in the host's PID namespace appear to leak after the child exits ([#5977](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5977), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix a panic caused by using the improper Result structure version when setting up CNI plugins ([#6320](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6320), [@juanfresia](https://github.com/juanfresia))\r\n - Revert fix for CVE-2022-27652 by re-adding inheritable capabilities. While there is a workaround, we believe this causes regression mid cycle with is contrary to CRI-O's backporting policy. The risk of the CVE is low, and so there is little risk in reverting here. ([#6168](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6168), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Update `cni_default_network` to not be commented by default in the output of `crio config` ([#5566](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5566), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Uncategorized\r\n - Fix a bug where a container is stuck in INIT because CRI-O believes it to be paused, and never updates the state ([#6143](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6143), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a bug where exit files were never cleaned up from `/run/crio/exits` ([#6171](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/6171), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Fix a rare deadlock while communicating to systemd (RHBZ 2082344) ([#5961](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5961), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Use default umask `0o022` if CRI-O runs under a different umask value.

Thanks!](#community-thanks)\r\n\r\n# Major Changes\r\n\r\n## Overload Manager\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to enable Envoy overload manager to avoid traffic disturbances when Envoy process allocates too much heap and is terminated by the Linux out-of-memory manager.\r\nThe feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by following [instructions here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/overload-manager/).\r\n\r\n(#4597, @tsaarni)\r\n\r\n## JWT Verification Support\r\n\r\nContour's HTTPProxy now supports configuring Envoy's [JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/jwt_authn_filter), for verifying JWTs on incoming requests.\r\n\r\nA root HTTPProxy can optionally define one or more JWT providers, each of which can define an issuer, audiences, and a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) to use for verifying JWTs.\r\n\r\nJWT providers can then be applied as requirements to routes on the HTTPProxy (or routes on [included HTTPProxies](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/inclusion-delegation/)), either by setting one provider as the default, or by explicitly specifying a JWT provider to require for a given route.\r\nIndividual routes may also opt out of JWT verification if a default provider has been set for the HTTPProxy.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n- [JWT verification documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/jwt-verification)\r\n- [JWTProvider API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.JWTProvider)\r\n- [JWTVerificationPolicy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.JWTVerificationPolicy)\r\n\r\n(#4723, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Slow start mode\r\n\r\nSlow start mode is a configuration setting that is used to gradually increase the amount of traffic targeted to a newly added upstream endpoint.\r\nThis can be useful for example with JVM based applications, that might otherwise get overwhelmed during JIT warm-up period.\r\nFor more information [see here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/slow-start/).\r\n\r\n(#4772, @tsaarni)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy CORS policy supports regex matching on Allowed Origins\r\n\r\nThe AllowOrigin field of the HTTPProxy CORSPolicy can be configured as a regex to enable more flexibility for users.\r\nMore advanced matching can now be performed on the `Origin` header of HTTP requests, instead of restricting users to allow all origins, or enumerating all possible values.\r\n\r\n(#4710, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Transition to `default_source_code` Lua filter field from deprecated `inline_string` field for specifying Lua scripts. (#4622, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- There are so many EnsureXDeleted in the sub-packages of objects , so unify them to objects/EnsureObjectDelete (#4630, @izturn)\r\n- Transition to using new bootstrap field `default_regex_engine` instead of deprecated per-regex match engine selection. (#4652, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway Listeners with Secret references whose namespace is not covered by a ReferenceGrant should have their status reason set to RefNotPermitted. (#4664, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Add a new flag `leader-election-namespace` for gateway-provisioner (#4669, @izturn)\r\n- Add Contour log level configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4676, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes client debug log level configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4677, @izturn)\r\n- add the fields extraVolumes & extraVolumeMounts to crd/ContourDeployment to enable Envoy pods to mount additional volumes (#4680, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes annotations configurability to ContourDeployment resource. to enable customize pod annotations for pod/envoy (#4681, @izturn)\r\n- Add Kubernetes resource labels configurability to ContourDeployment resource. (#4709, @izturn)\r\n- Add resource requirements configurability to ContourDeployment to enable resource quota for containers. (#4712, @izturn)\r\n- Gateway API: status-only updates to resources no longer trigger DAG reprocessing and xDS updates. (#4744, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: don't make status update calls to the API server if status has not changed on the resource. (#4745, @skriss)\r\n- Updates to Gateway API v0.5.1. (#4755, @skriss)\r\n- Update supported Kubernetes versions to 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25. (#4757, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- For Gateway API conformance, when a HTTP request matches multiple rules within a HTTPRoute, precedence is given to the rule that comes first in that HTTPRoute (in list-order). (#4763, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates Go to 1.19.2, see [release notes here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.minor). (#4773, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Update Envoy to v1.24.0. See the [Envoy release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.24.0/version_history/v1.24/v1.24.0) for more information. (#4804, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Added guide for configuring gRPC routes. (#4725, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecation and Removal Notices\r\n\r\n## Contour v1.20 minor release now out of support\r\n\r\nAs per [Contour's support policy](https://projectcontour.io/resources/support/) the v1.20 minor release will now no longer be patched for security or critical bug fixes.\r\nPlease upgrade to the v1.21 minor release or newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing and Upgrading\r\n\r\nFor a fresh install of Contour, consult the [getting started documentation](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade an existing Contour installation, please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.23.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.23 through 1.25.\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better! For this release, special thanks go out to the following contributors:\r\n\r\n- @izturn\r\n\r\n\r\n# Are you a Contour user?

As routes using the cluster domain suffix are not exposed through Ingress, users will need to [configure DNS](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#configure-dns) in order to expose their services (most users probably already are). (#13259, @psschwei)\r\n- Upgrade HorizontalPodAutoscaler to autoscaling/v2 API version (#13337, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Services may now set `seccompProfile` in SecurityContext to allow users to comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standards best-practice (#13401, @evankanderson)\r\n- Bump min-version to k8s 1.23, so removing kind 1.22 testing (#13357, @nader-ziada)\r\n- Increase the outbound context deadline in reconcilers to 30s (from 10s) to match the maximum K8s webhook timeout. (#13323, @mattmoor)\r\n \r\n## \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n- Add timeout handling in Activator  when processing a request for a revision (#13261, @nader-ziada)\r\n- EmptyDir volumes feature flag is now enabled by default (#13405, @dprotaso)\r\n- Queue proxy explicit set `SeccompProfile` to `RunTimeDefault` to be able to run under restricted PSP policy by default. (#13376, @skonto)\r\n- Save data from perf tests to create a dashboard. (#13192, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\n### Bug or Regression\r\n\r\n- Knative services can now specify securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation (#13395, @mattmoor)\r\n- ConfigMap config-defaults property `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` now defaults to `revision-timeout-seconds`. This should unblock upgrades who set `revision-timeout-seconds` lower than the default value of 300 (#13255, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix LatestReadyRevision semantics so it only advances forward. When a Revision fails the Configuration & Route will no longer fall back to older revision. The exception is when you rollback to a Revision that is explicitly named.

RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\nErlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)\r\nacross all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.11.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * Partially reverts an unsafe inter-node communication [optimization](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3865) that could affect\r\n    classic mirrored queue operation ordering.\r\n\r\n    Kudos to @bording for providing an automated way to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6115](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/6115)\r\n\r\n  * Classic mirrored queue leader replica issued to much credit to follower replicas,\r\n    resulting in an uneven load and memory footprint between them.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6110](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6110)\r\n\r\n  * Intra-cluster communication link metric collector could run into an exception when\r\n    peer connection has just been re-established, e.g. after a peer node restart.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6127](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6127)\r\n\r\n### MQTT Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n  * When a node was [put into maintenance mode](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html#maintenance-mode), it closed all MQTT client connections\r\n    cluster-wide instead of just local client connections.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#6108](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6108)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\nNone in this release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.11.2.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2022-10-18T20:56:47Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v4.3.0", "tag_name": "v4.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "body": "### Features\r\n- A new command, `podman generate spec`, has been added, which creates a JSON struct based on a given container that can be used with the Podman REST API to create containers.\r\n- A new command, `podman update`, has been added,which makes changes to the resource limits of existing containers. Please note that these changes do not persist if the container is restarted ([#15067](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15067)).\r\n- A new command, `podman kube down`, has been added, which removes pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML (functionality is identical to `podman kube play --down`, but it now has its own command).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports Kubernetes secrets using Podman's secrets backend.\r\n- Systemd-managed pods created by the `podman kube play` command now integrate with sd-notify, using the `io.containers.sdnotify` annotation (or `io.containers.sdnotify/$name` for specific containers).\r\n- Systemd-managed pods created by `podman kube play` can now be auto-updated, using the `io.containers.auto-update` annotation (or `io.containers.auto-update/$name` for specific containers).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command can now read YAML from URLs, e.g. `podman kube play https://example.com/demo.yml` ([#14955](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14955)).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `emptyDir` volume type ([#13309](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13309)).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `HostUsers` field in the pod spec.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports `binaryData` in ConfigMaps.\r\n- The `podman pod create` command can now set additional resource limits for pods using the new `--memory-swap`, `--cpuset-mems`, `--device-read-bps`, `--device-write-bps`, `--blkio-weight`, `--blkio-weight-device`, and `--cpu-shares` options.\r\n- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--username`, to set the username that will be used to connect to the VM as a non-root user ([#15402](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15402)).\r\n- The `podman volume create` command's `-o timeout=` option can now set a timeout of 0, indicating volume plugin operations will never time out.\r\n- Added support for a new volume driver, `image`, which allows volumes to be created that are backed by images.\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--env-merge`, allowing environment variables to be specified relative to other environment variables in the image (e.g. `podman run --env-merge \"PATH=$PATH:/my/app\" ...`) ([#15288](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15288)).\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--on-failure`, to allow action to be taken when a container fails health checks, with the following supported actions: `none` (take no action, the default), `kill` (kill the container), `restart` (restart the container), and `stop` (stop the container).\r\n- The `--keep-id` option to `podman create` and `podman run` now supports new options, `uid` and `gid`, to set the UID and GID of the user in the container that will be mapped to the user running Podman (e.g. `--userns=keep-id:uid=11` will made the user running Podman to UID 11 in the container) ([#15294](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15294)).\r\n- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--env`/`-e`, to set environment variables in the generated unit file ([#15523](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15523)).\r\n- The `podman pause` and `podman unpause` commands now support the `--latest`, `--cidfile`, and `--filter` options.\r\n- The `podman restart` command now supports the `--cidfile` and `--filter` options.\r\n- The `podman rm` command now supports the `--filter` option to select which containers will be removed.\r\n- The `podman rmi` command now supports a new option, `--no-prune`, to prevent the removal of dangling parents of removed images.\r\n- The `--dns-opt` option to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` has received a new alias, `--dns-option`, to improve Docker compatibility.\r\n- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--debug`/`-D`, which enables debug-level logging (identical to `--log-level=debug`), improving Docker compatibility.\r\n- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--config`. This flag is ignored, and is only included for Docker compatibility ([#14767](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14767)).\r\n- The `podman manifest create` command now accepts a new option, `--amend`/`-a`.\r\n- The `podman manifest create`, `podman manifest add` and `podman manifest push` commands now accept a new option, `--insecure` (identical to `--tls-verify=false`), improving Docker compatibility.\r\n- The `podman secret create` command's `--driver` and `--format` options now have new aliases, `-d` for `--driver` and `-f` for `--format`.\r\n- The `podman secret create` command now supports a new option, `--label`/`-l`, to add labels to created secrets.\r\n- The `podman secret ls` command now accepts the `--quiet`/`-q` option.\r\n- The `podman secret inspect` command now accepts a new option, `--pretty`, to print output in human-readable format.\r\n- The `podman stats` command now accepts the `--no-trunc` option.\r\n- The `podman save` command now accepts the `--signature-policy` option ([#15869](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15869)).\r\n- The `podman pod inspect` command now allows multiple arguments to be passed. If so, it will return a JSON array of the inspected pods ([#15674](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15674)).\r\n- A series of new hidden commands have been added under `podman context` as aliases to existing `podman system connection` commands, to improve Docker compatibility.\r\n- The remote Podman client now supports proxying signals for attach sessions when the `--sig-proxy` option is set ([#14707](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14707)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Duplicate volume mounts are now allowed with the `-v` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create`, so long as source, destination, and options all match ([#4217](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/4217)).\r\n- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands have been renamed to `podman kube generate` and `podman kube play` to group Kubernetes-related commands. Aliases have been added to ensure the old command names still function.\r\n- A number of Podman commands (`podman init`, `podman container checkpoint`, `podman container restore`, `podman container cleanup`) now print the user-inputted name of the container, instead of its full ID, on success.\r\n- When an unsupported option (e.g. resource limit) is specified for a rootless container on a cgroups v1 system, a warning message is now printed that the limit will not be honored.\r\n- The installer for the Windows Podman client has been improved.\r\n- The `--cpu-rt-period` and `--cpu-rt-runtime` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now print a warning and are ignored on cgroups v2 systems (cgroups v2 having dropped support for these controllers) ([#15666](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15666)).\r\n- Privileged containers running systemd will no longer mount `/dev/tty*` devices other than `/dev/tty` itself into the container ([#15878](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15878)).\r\n- Events for containers that are part of a pod now include the ID of the pod in the event.\r\n- SSH functionality for `podman machine` commands has seen a thorough rework, addressing many issues about authentication.\r\n- The `--network` option to `podman kube play` now allows passing `host` to set the pod to use host networking, even if the YAML does not request this.\r\n- The `podman inspect` command on containers now includes the digest of the image used to create the container.\r\n- Pods created by `podman play kube` are now, by default, placed into a network named `podman-kube`. If the `podman-kube` network does not exist, it will be created. This ensures pods can connect to each other by their names, as the network has DNS enabled.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman network prune` and `podman container prune` commands did not properly support the `--filter label!=` option ([#14182](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14182)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube generate` command added an unnecessary `Secret: null` line to generated YAML ([#15156](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15156)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube generate` command did not set `enableServiceLinks` and `automountServiceAccountToken` to false in generated YAML ([#15478](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15478) and [#15243](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15243)).\r\n- Fixed a

respect default values for liveness probes ([#15855](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15855)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command did not bind ports if `hostPort` was not specified but `containerPort` was ([#15942](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15942)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command sometimes did not create directories on the host for `hostPath` volumes.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman manifest push` command did not display progress.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter \"{{.Config.Healthcheck}}\"` option to `podman image inspect` did not print the image's configured healthcheck ([#14661](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14661)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman volume create -o timeout=` option could be specified even when no volume plugin was in use.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman rmi` command did not emit `untag` events when removing tagged images ([#15485](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15485)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where API forwarding with `podman machine` VMs on windows could sometimes fail because the pipe was not created in time

Fixed a bug where the `exited` and `exec died` events for containers did not include the container's labels ([#15617](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15617)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where running Systemd containers on a system not using Systemd as PID 1 could fail ([#15647](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15647)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman did not pass all necessary environment variables (including `$PATH`) to Conmon when starting containers ([#15707](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15707)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman events` command could function improperly when no events were present ([#15688](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15688)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format` flag to various Podman commands did not properly handle template strings including a newline (`\\n`) ([#13446](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13446)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Systemd-managed pods would kill every container in a pod when a single container exited ([#14546](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/14546)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd` command would generate incorrect YAML for pods created without the `--name` option.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command did not properly set stop timeout ([#16149](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16149)).\r\n-

restarted.\r\n- Fixed a bug where creating a container with a working directory on an overlay volume would result in the container being unable to start ([#15789](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15789)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where attempting to remove a pod with running containers without `--force` would not error and instead would result in the pod, and its remaining containers, being placed in an unusable state ([#15526](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15526)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where memory limits reported by `podman stats` could exceed the maximum memory available on the system ([#15765](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15765)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman container clone` command did not properly handle environment variables whose value contained an `=` character ([#15836](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15836)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client would not print the container ID when running the `podman-remote run --attach stdin` command.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine list --format json` command did not properly show machine starting status.\r\n-

where an incorrect network option was displayed, causing issues with `docker-compose` ([#15580](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15580)).\r\n- The Libpod Restore endpoint for Containers now features a new query parameter, `pod`, to set the pod that the container will be restored into ([#15018](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15018)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the REST API could panic while retrieving images.\r\n- Fixed a bug where a cancelled connection to several endpoints could induce a memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Error messages when attempting to remove an image used by a non-Podman container have been improved ([#15006](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15006)).\r\n- Podman will no longer print a warning that `/` is not a shared mount when run

This has the effect of causing rollbacks from Rancher v2.6.4 to any previous version of Rancher v2.6.x to fail because the previous version the CRDs needed to roll back are no longer available in v1beta1. To avoid this, the Rancher resource cleanup script should be run **before** the restore or rollback is attempted. This script can be found in the [rancherlabs/support-tools repo](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/rancher-cleanup) and the usage of the script can be found in [the backup-restore operator docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/). In addition, when users roll back Rancher on the same cluster using the Rancher Backup and Restore app in 2.6.4+, the [updated steps to create the Restore Custom Resource](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/restoring-rancher/#create-the-restore-custom-resource) must be followed. See also [#36803](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36803) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue which caused version 1.0.0 of the CSP Adapter to incorrectly count nodes. Users should only use version 1.0.1 or higher of the adapter to ensure that node counts are accurate. See [#38712](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38712).\r\n- Fixed an issue where role templates with circular references (e.g., role template 1 inherits role template 2 which inherits role template 1) could result in high CPU usage and crashes. Requests to create new role templates with such a structure (or edit existing role templates to have such a structure) should not fail, and Rancher should no longer have excessively high CPU cycles when attempting to process such existing roles. Note that this will not remove existing custom roles which have circular references; therefore, it is recommended that users review existing role templates to ensure that they do not have circular references (such role templates will not function as desired). See [#38419](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38419).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which user attributes were not being refreshed correctly and sometimes became empty which caused impersonation rules to be incorrect. See [#36096](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36096).\r\n- Fixed an issue where user-defined EKS security groups were configured as the only node group security groups rather than being appended to the cluster default security group. See [#38014](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38014).\r\n- Fixed issue in which OPA Gatekeeper became stuck when uninstalled. See [#37029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37029).\r\n- Users running RHEL/CentOS 7 may install or upgrade using K3s/RKE2 v1.24.4 and up. See [#5912](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/5912).\r\n- RKE v1.3.10-v1.3.13 in Rancher v2.6.7-v2.6.8 no longer removes user addons during an upgrade before redeploying them, which would cause issues with RKE1 cluster upgrades if user addons template has `cattle-*` or other system namespaces. See [#38876](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38876).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which after installing any chart through the Rancher UI, the `proxy` container of the `helm-operation` pod was not terminated, and it would become `NotReady`. See [#38873](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38873).\r\n- Resolved an issue in which Kubernetes API events were not recorded when the log level was set to 3. See [#38323](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38323).\r\n- Admins can now reconfigure (edit) a new Azure AD setup as well as a setup with updated endpoints for the Microsoft Graph without errors. See [#38753](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38753).\r\n- A bug has been fixed that resulted in certain clusters being rendered unavailable after upgrade. This was due to improper migration of certain cluster fields to secrets. The known cluster types this affected were legacy AKS, GKE, and EKS clusters but may have affected other types of clusters as well. See [#38699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38699).\r\n- RKE2 and K3s custom clusters now provision as expected when using a proxy. See [#39068](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39068).\r\n- Fixed an issue in which the Rancher UI produced the wrong CLI command when joining a node to a cluster with a taint in AWS. See [#6827](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6827).\r\n- In the Rancher UI, yellow icons have been added to indicate which clusters need to be updated. See [#6580](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6580).\r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- For Azure AD, Rancher now doesn't create or update the cached secret with the Azure AD access token if a new token does not have the necessary permissions. Rancher also prevents admins from updating the endpoints for Microsoft Graph if a new token lacks permissions. Note that this will be removed in v2.6.10 in favor of a different approach of handling token permissions. See [#38754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38754).\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n### Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- Upon upgrade to Rancher v2.6.8, the UI consistently throws `Websocket Disconnected` errors. Note that alerts have been hidden behind a toggle by default so that systems remain usable. See [#6960](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6960).\r\n- When navigating to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Management page or Home page, the namespace filter is missing from the top-right corner. As a workaround, navigate to the Continuous Delivery page from the Cluster Explorer page to have access to the namespace filter. See [#7213](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7213).\r\n- Kubernetes versions 1.24.x are incorrectly marked as \u201cexperimental\u201d when provisioning AKS clusters (1.24.x versions are fully supported for AKS clusters). See [#7217](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7217).\r\n\r\n### Harvester\r\n\r\n- When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n\r\n### K3s\r\n\r\n- The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. This will be fixed in an upcoming release. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n\r\n### RKE \r\n\r\n- High CPU usage is observed on RKE1 v1.24.x clusters. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816]( https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Cert-Manager:**\r\n  - Rancher now supports cert-manager versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1. We recommend v1.7.x because v 1.6.x will reach end-of-life on March 30, 2022. To read more, see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#4-install-cert-manager).\r\n  - When upgrading Rancher and cert-manager, you will need to use [Option B: Reinstalling Rancher and cert-manager](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/upgrades/#option-b-reinstalling-rancher-and-cert-manager) from the Rancher docs.\r\n  - There are several versions of cert-manager which, due to their backwards incompatibility, are not recommended for use with Rancher. You can read more about which versions are affected by this issue in the [cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/). As a result, only versions 1.6.2 and 1.7.1 are recommended for use at this time.\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.5 to 1.6, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.5-1.6/).\r\n  - For instructions on upgrading cert-manager from version 1.6 to 1.7, see the [relevant cert-manager docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/upgrading/upgrading-1.6-1.7/).\r\n- **Readiness and Liveness Check:**\r\n  - Users can now configure the `Readiness Check` and `Liveness Check` of `coredns-autoscaler`. See [#24939](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/24939).\r\n- **Legacy Features:**\r\n  - Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n  - When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.  See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).\r\n- **Library and Helm3-Library Catalogs:**\r\n  - Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.\r\n- **Local Cluster:**\r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Upgrading the Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and Saving Clusters:**\r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **EKS Cluster:**\r\n  - There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System Components:**\r\n  - Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **GKE and AKS Clusters:**\r\n  - Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **Rolling Back Rancher:**\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC:**\r\n  - Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **Azure Cloud Provider for RKE2:**\r\n  - For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs. Kube Nodes:**\r\n  - In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Rancher's External IP Webhook:**\r\n  - In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Memory Limit for Monitoring:**\r\n  - The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Snapshot\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.9\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.6.9](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.9)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.15](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.15)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.10\r\n- v1.22.13\r\n- v1.21.14\r\n- v1.20.15\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nFeature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tUsed to enable the ability to provision RKE2 clusters. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Rancher Features\r\n\r\n- RancherD was introduced as part of Rancher v2.5.4 through v2.5.10 as an experimental feature but is now deprecated. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/authentication/azure-ad/#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\nThe following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring v1\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster gets stuck in provisioning state after an upgrade to v2.6.4 and rollback to v2.6.3. See [#36859](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36859).\r\n    - RKE2 node driver cluster has its nodes redeployed when upgrading Rancher from v2.6.3 to v2.6.4. See [#36627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36627).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/faq/networking/cni-providers/#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - In v2.6.5, v1.21.x of RKE2 will remain experimental and [unsupported](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) for RKE2 Windows. End users should not use v1.21.x of RKE2 for any RKE2 cluster that will have Windows worker nodes. This is due to an [upstream Calico bug](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131#issuecomment-1007792897) that was not backported to the minor version of Calico (3.19.x) that is present in v1.21.x of RKE2. See [#131](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/131).\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **AWS:**\r\n    - On RHEL8.4 SELinux in AWS AMI, Kubernetes v1.22 fails to provision on AWS. As Rancher will not install RPMs on the nodes, users may work around this issue either by using AMI with this package already installed, or by installing AMI via cloud-init. Users will encounter this issue on upgrade to v1.22 as well. When upgrading to 1.22, users must manually upgrade/install the rancher-selinux package on all the nodes in the cluster, then upgrade the Kubernetes version. See [#36509](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36509).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n  - **Oracle:**\r\n    - Kubernetes 1.24 clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4. See [#38214](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38214).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n    - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).\r\n    - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2022-10-14T22:32:43Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.7-dev8", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/ea8aebe8c519d3f8d85bd8e4f8fd272c8bddf447", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.7-dev8\n\nReleased version 2.7-dev8 with the following main changes :\n    -

To improve the situation around debugging policies that use those built-ins, OPA now provides an opt-in system for caching the inputs and outputs of these built-ins during policy evaluation, and can include this information in decision log entries.\r\n\r\nA new top-level config key is used to enable the non-deterministic builtin caching feature, as shown below:\r\n\r\n    nd_builtin_cache: true\r\n\r\nThis data is exposed to OPA's [decision log masking system](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.45.0/management-decision-logs/#masking-sensitive-data) under the `/nd_builtin_cache` path, which allows masking or dropping sensitive values from decision logs selectively. This can be useful in situations where only some information about a non-deterministic built-in was needed, or the arguments to the built-in involved sensitive data.\r\n\r\nTo prevent unexpected decision log size growth from non-deterministic built-ins like `http.send`, the new cache information is included in decision logs on a best-effort basis. If a decision log event exceeds the `decision_logs.reporting.upload_size_limit_bytes` limit for an OPA instance, OPA will reattempt uploading it, after dropping the non-deterministic builtin cache information from the event. This behavior will trigger a log error when it happens, and will increment the `decision_logs_nd_builtin_cache_dropped` metrics counter, so that it will be possible to debug cases where the cache information is unexpectedly missing from a decision log entry.\r\n\r\n#### Decision Logging Example\r\n\r\nTo observe the change in decision logging we can run OPA in server mode with `nd_builtin_cache` enabled:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nopa run -s --set=decision_logs.console=true,nd_builtin_cache=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter sending it the query `x := rand.intn(\"a\", 15)` we should see something like the following in the decision logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{..., \"msg\":\"Decision Log\", \"nd_builtin_cache\":{\"rand.intn\":{\"[\\\"a\\\",15]\":3}}, \"query\":\"assign(x, rand.intn(\\\"a\\\", 15))\", ..., \"result\":[{\"x\":3}], ..., \"type\":\"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new information is included under the optional `nd_builtin_cache` JSON key, and shows what arguments were provided for each unique invocation of `rand.intn`, as well as what the output of that builtin call was (in this case, `3`).\r\n\r\nIf we send the query `x := rand.intn(\"a\", 15); y := rand.intn(\"b\", 150)\"` we can see how unique input arguments get recorded in the cache:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{..., \"msg\":\"Decision Log\", \"nd_builtin_cache\":{\"rand.intn\":{\"[\\\"a\\\",15]\":12,\"[\\\"b\\\",150]\":149}}, \"query\":\"assign(x, rand.intn(\\\"a\\\", 15)); assign(y, rand.intn(\\\"b\\\", 150))\", ..., \"result\":[{\"x\":12,\"y\":149}], ..., \"type\":\"openpolicyagent.org/decision_logs\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this information, it's now easier to debug exactly why a particular rule is used or why a rule fails when non-deterministic builtins are used in a policy.\r\n\r\n### New Built-in Function: `regex.replace`\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new builtin for regex-based search/replace on strings: `regex.replace`.\r\n\r\nSee [the built-in functions docs for all the details](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.45.0/policy-reference/#builtin-regex-regexreplace)\r\n\r\nThis implementation fixes [#5162](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5162) and was authored by @boranx.\r\n\r\n### `object.union_n` Optimization\r\n\r\nThe `object.union_n` builtin allows easily merging together an array of Objects.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as noted in [#4985](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4985) its implementation generated unnecessary intermediate copies from doing pairwise, recursive Object merges. These pairwise merges resulted in poor performance for large inputs; in many cases worse than writing the equivalent operation in pure Rego.\r\n\r\nThis release changes the `object.union_n` builtin's implementation to use a more efficient merge algorithm that respects the original implementation's sequential, left-to-right merging semantics. The `object.union_n` builtin now provides a 2-3x improvement in speed and memory efficiency over the pure Rego equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK, and Runtime\r\n\r\n- cli: Fix doubled CLI hints/errors.

Changes\r\n\r\n### Fix VTOrc Discovery\r\n\r\nIn patch releases prior to release 14.0.3, if VTOrc is unable to reach the MySQL instance of a vttablet, it was never able to read discover that tablet again.\r\nThis problem could be resolved by restarting the VTOrc so that it discovers all the tablets again, but in a kubernetes cluster where the pods are eviced \r\nfrequently, this posed a greater challenge, since some pods when evicted and rescheduled on a different node, would sometimes fail to be discovered by VTOrc.\r\nThis has problem has been addressed in this patch by the fix

This could cause some race issues around rotation time. However,\n  there was another issue where a past worker authentication record could be\n  looked up for some operations instead of the current one, made more likely by\n  the too-frequent rotations. In 0.11.0 we attempt to ensure that the record\n  that remains on upgrade is the most current one, but it is possible that the\n  wrong one is chosen, leading to a failure for the worker to authenticate or\n  for some operations to consistently fail. In this case, the worker will need\n  to be deleted and re-authorized. We apologize for any issues this causes and\n  this should be remedied going forward.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix bug preventing delete of org. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465)\n* scopes: Organizations could be prevented from being deleted if some resources\n    remained ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465))\n* workers: Authentication rotation could occur prior to the expected time\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2484))\n* workers: When looking up worker authentication records, an old record could be\n  returned instead of the new one, leading to errors for encryption or\n  decryption operations ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* vault: (HCP Boundary only): Private Vault clusters can be used with HCP Boundary by using PKI workers\n  deployed in the same network as a private cluster. Tags are used to control which PKI workers can manage private Vault\n  requests by specifying a `worker_filter` attribute when configuring a Vault credential store.\n* credentials: There is now a `json` credential type supported by `static`\n  credential stores that allows submitting a generic JSON object to Boundary for\n  use with credential brokering workflows\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2423))\n* ui: Add support for worker management\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1229))\n* ui: Add support for PKI worker registration\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1244))\n* ui: Add support for Static Credential Stores\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1193))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Password Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1205))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Key Pair Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1266))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): SSH Target creation along with injected application\n  credential support ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1027))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): Update vault credential stores to support private\n  vault access ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1318))\n* ui: Improve quick setup wizard onboarding guide resource names\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1328))\n* ui: Updates to host catalog and host set forms and \u201cLearn More\u201d links\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1342))\n* workers: Added the ability to read and reinitialize the Worker certificate\n  authority ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2312),\n  [PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2387))\n* workers: Return the worker Boundary binary version on worker list and read\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2377))\n* workers: Addition of worker graceful shutdown, triggered by an initial\n  `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2455))\n* workers: Retain one previous encryption/decryption key after authentication\n  rotation ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In 0.5.0, the `add-host-sets`, `remove-host-sets`, and `set-host-sets` actions\n  on targets were deprecated in favor of `add-host-sources`,\n  `remove-host-sources`, and `set-host-sources`. Originally these actions and\n  API calls were to be removed in 0.6, but this was delayed to give extra time\n  for clients to switch over. This has now been fully switched over. A database\n  migration will modify any grants in roles to have the new actions. This same\n  changeover has been made for `add-/remove-/set-credential-libraries` to\n  `add-/remove-/set-credential-sources`, although those actions would only be in\n  grant strings in very rare circumstances as the `-sources` actions replaced\n  the `-libraries` actions very quickly.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2393))\n\n", "created_at": "2022-09-27T13:35:44Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.4.1", "tag_name": "v2.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.4.1 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis release introduces several new features, enhancements, bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix: mark 2.4.1 not as pre-release version https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/3679", "created_at": "2022-09-27T13:11:45Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3005.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases/tag/v3005.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt", "body": "", "created_at": "2022-09-26T21:14:33Z", "project": "SaltStack", "repo": "saltstack/salt", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.20.0", "tag_name": "v2.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/releases/tag/v2.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray", "body": "### Deprecation / Removal\r\n- Drop Ansible support for v2.9 and v2.10 (#8925, @oomichi)\r\n- Drop support for Fedora 34 (#8967, @floryut)\r\n\r\n### Feature / Major changes\r\n\r\n- Add Rocky Linux 8 support (#8905, @oomichi)\r\n- Add Kylin Linux support.

Details in the [span metrics documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/metrics-generator/span_metrics/).\r\n* (#1556) Jsonnet users will need to specify ephemeral storage requests and limits for the metrics generator.\r\n* (#1481) Anonymous usage reporting has been added. Distributors and metrics generators will now require permissions to object storage equivalent to compactors and ingesters. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled easily.\r\n* (#1558) Deprecated metrics `tempodb_(gcs|s3|azure)_request_duration_seconds` have been removed in favor of `tempodb_backend_request_duration_seconds`.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] metrics-generator: Changed added metric label `instance` to `__metrics_gen_instance` to reduce collisions with custom dimensions.

[GH-11909](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11909)\r\n* core: During long running builds the HCP Packer registry will mark a build as\r\n    timed out if it has not posted an update after a certain number of minutes. For HCP\r\n    Packer enabled builds a status update will now be sent every 2 minutes to\r\n    the registry to prevent long builds from being marked as timed\r\n    out. [GH-11846](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11846)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add `component_type` configuration argument to\r\n    support specifying an exact build image when multiple images exist in the\r\n    same provider and region for a given HCP Packer bucket iteration.\r\n    [GH-11872](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11872)\r\n* data/hcp_packer_image: Add support for `channel` as input argument to\r\n    retrieve an image from the associated iteration. If\r\n    using several images from a single iteration, you may prefer sourcing an\r\n    iteration first, and referencing it for subsequent uses, as every\r\n    `hcp_packer_image` with the channel set will generate a potentially\r\n    billable HCP Packer request, but if several `hcp_packer_image`s use a\r\n    shared `hcp_packer_iteration` that will only generate one potentially\r\n    billable request.\r\n    [GH-11865](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11865)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when parsing malformed provisioner override blocks.\r\n    [GH-11881](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11881)\r\n* core/hcl2: Fix crash when running `packer validate` on templates containing\r\n    one or more  HCP Packer data sources.\r\n    [GH-11883](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/11883)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-08-02T09:55:28Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "0.12.10", "tag_name": "v0.12.10", "html_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.12.10", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gogs/gogs", "body": "### Changed\r\n\r\n- Support using `[security] LOCAL_NETWORK_ALLOWLIST = *` to allow all hostnames.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads.

-launch-cache (#1417 by @natalieparellano)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* Running `pack build` with a builder using [lifecycle 0.14.0](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.0) yields an error [\"ERROR: failed to create launch cache\"](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1467).\r\n    * Cause: https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/pull/847\r\n    * Resolutions:\r\n        * **Option 1:** Use a builder with `lifecycle` >= [0.14.1](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.1).\r\n           `pack builder inspect <builder-image>` can be used to inspect a builder image.\r\n        * **Option 2:** Use `--lifecycle-image=buildpacksio/lifecycle:0.14.1 --trust-builder=false` flags with `pack build`.\r\n            These flags would make pack use the patched version of the lifecycle for the `analyze`, `restore` and `export` phases.\r\n            [Learn more](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/concepts/trusted_builders/).\r\n\r\n##
