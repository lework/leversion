It contains important up-to-date bugfixes.\r\nThe v1.87.x line will be supported for at least 12 months since [v1.87.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1870) release**\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): alerts state restore procedure was changed to become asynchronous. It doesn't block groups start anymore which significantly improves vmalert's startup time.\r\n  This also means that `-remoteRead.ignoreRestoreErrors` command-line flag becomes deprecated now and will have no effect if configured.\r\n  While previously state restore attempt was made for all the loaded alerting rules, now it is called only for alerts which became active after the first evaluation. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2608).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): optimize VMUI for use from smartphones and tablets. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3707).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add ability to search tenants in the drop-down list for the tenant selector. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3792).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add avg/min/max/last values to line legends and tooltips for graphs. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3706).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): hide the default `per-job resource usage` dashboard if there is a custom dashboard exists at the directory specified via `-vmui.customDashboardsPath` command-line flag. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3740).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): fix panic in [HashiCorp Nomad service discovery](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/sd_configs.html#nomad_sd_configs). Thanks to @mr-karan for the [pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/3784).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): fix display of rules number per-group for groups with identical names in UI.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): prevent disabling state updates tracking per rule via setting values < 1. The minimum number of update states to track is now set to 1.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): properly update `debug` and `update_entries_limit` rule's params on config's hot-reload.\r\n* BUGFIX: properly initialize the `vm_concurrent_insert_current` metric before exposing it. Previously this metric could be left uninitialized in some cases, e.g. its value was zero. This could lead to false alerts for the query `avg_over_time(vm_concurrent_insert_current[1m]) >= vm_concurrent_insert_capacity`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/3761).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): immediately cancel in-flight scrape requests during configuration reload when using [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode). Previously `vmagent` could wait for long time until all the in-flight requests are completed before reloading the configuration. This could significantly slow down configuration reload.

This\r\n  had been the original intention; it was a mistake that it was optional.\r\n  Unfortunately, due to a separate defect in the update verification logic for\r\n  static hosts, it was possible for a host to be updated (but not created) with\r\n  a port. This meant that targets could use ports attached to host addresses,\r\n  which was not the intention and leads to confusing behavior across different\r\n  installations. In this version, updating static hosts will no longer allow\r\n  ports to be part of the address; when authorizing a session, any port on such\r\n  a host will be ignored in favor of the default port on the target. In Boundary\r\n  0.14.0, this will become an error instead. As a consequence, it means that the\r\n  fallback logic for targets that did not have a default port defined is no\r\n  longer in service; all targets must now have a default port defined.\r\n* With the introduction of `vault-ssh-certificate` credential libraries, the\r\n  `vault` credential library subtype is being renamed to `vault-generic` to\r\n  denote it as a credential library that can be used in a generalized way to\r\n  issue credentials from vault. Existing credential libraries with the\r\n  subtype of `vault` will be updated to `vault-generic`. The subtype of\r\n  `vault` will still be accepted as a valid subtype in API requests to the\r\n  credential libraries endpoints, but is deprecated. Instead `vault-generic`\r\n  should be used. In addition the `boundary credential-libraries create\r\n  vault` and `boundary credential-libraries update vault` subcommands will\r\n  still function, but are deprecated. Instead `boundary credential-libraries\r\n  create vault-generic` and `boundary credential-libraries update\r\n  vault-generic` should be used. Also note that any credential library created\r\n  using the subtype of `vault`, either via the API or via the deprecated\r\n  subcommand, will have the subtype set to `vault-generic`. The deprecated\r\n  subtype and subcommands will be removed in boundary 0.14.0, at which point\r\n  `vault-generic` must be used.\r\n* In Boundary 0.1.8 using the `-format=json` option with the cli would provide\r\n  a `status_code` for successful API requests from the cli. However, in the\r\n  case where an error was returned, the JSON would use `status` instead. This\r\n  inconsistency has been fixed, with `status_code` being used in both cases.\r\n  For error cases `status` will still be populated, but is deprecated and will\r\n  be removed in 0.14.0.\r\n\r\n### New and Improved\r\n\r\n* Direct Address Targets: You can now set an address directly on a target,\r\n  bypassing the need for host catalogs, host sets and hosts.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2613))\r\n* Custom Response Headers: Adds ability to set api and ui response headers based\r\n  on status code. Includes default secure CSP and other headers.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2587))\r\n* metrics: Adds accepted connections and closed connections counters to keep track\r\n  downstream connections for worker and controller servers.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2668))\r\n* Egress and Ingress worker filters: The target `worker_filter` field has been deprecated and \r\n replaced with egress and ingress worker filters. Egress worker filters determine which workers are\r\n used to access targets. Ingress worker filters (HCP Boundary only) determine which workers are \r\n used to connect with a client to initiate a session. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2654))\r\n* Multi-Hop Sessions (HCP Boundary only): Multi-hop PKI workers can communicate with each other to serve \r\n 2 primary purposes: authentication and session proxying. This results in the ability to chain \r\n multiple workers together to access services hidden under layers of network security. Multi-hop \r\n workers can also establish a TCP session through multiple workers, with the ability to reverse \r\n proxy and establish a connection.\r\n* ui: Upgrade Admin UI to Ember 4.4.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1523))\r\n* ui: Add support for JSON credentials in Admin UI.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1498))\r\n* Vault SSH certificate credential library: A new credential library that uses\r\n  the vault ssh secret engine to generate ssh private key and certificates. The\r\n  library can be used as an injected application credential source for targets\r\n  that support credential injection. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2860))\r\n* ui: Add support for managed groups in add-principals list. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1548))\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* plugins: Ignore `SIGHUP` sent to parent process; some init systems, notably\r\n  `dumb-init`, would pass them along to the child processes and cause the\r\n  plugin to exit ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2677))\r\n* data warehouse: Fix bug that caused credential dimensions to not get\r\n    associated with session facts ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2787)).\r\n* sessions: Fix two authorizeSession race conditions in handleProxy. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2795))\r\n* cli: When using `-format=json` the JSON was inconsistent in how it reported\r\n  status codes. In successful cases it would use `status_code`, but in error\r\n  cases it would use `status`. Now `status_code` is used in both cases. In\r\n  error cases `status` is still populated, see the deprecations above for\r\n  more details. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2887))\r\n* database: Add job that automatically cleans up completed runs in the `job_run` table.\r\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2866))\r\n* core: Linux packages now have vendor label and set the default label to HashiCorp.\r\n  This fix is implemented for any future releases, but will not be updated for historical releases.\r\n", "created_at": "2023-02-08T02:06:00Z", "project": "Boundary", "repo": "hashicorp/boundary", "type": "Security", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.49.0", "tag_name": "v0.49.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.49.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa", "body": "This release focuses on bugfixes and documentation improvements, as well as a few small performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- runtime: Update rule index's trie node scalar handling so that numerics compare correctly ([#5585](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5585)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar reported by @alvarogomez93\r\n- ast: Improve error information when metadata yaml fails to compile ([#4475](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4475)) authored and reported by @johanfylling\r\n- bundle: Retain metadata annotations for Wasm entrypoints during inspection ([#5588](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5588)) authored and reported by @johanfylling\r\n- compile: Allow object generating rules to be annotated as entrypoints ([#5577](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5577)) authored and reported by @johanfylling\r\n- plugins/discovery: Support for persisting and loading discovery bundle from disk ([#2886](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2886)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar reported by @anderseknert\r\n- perf: Use `json.Encode` to avoid extra allocation (authored by @anderseknert)\r\n- `opa inspect`: Fix prefix error when inspecting bundle from root ([#5503](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5503)) authored by @harikannan512 reported by @HarshPathakhp\r\n- topdown: `http.send` to cache responses based on status code ([#5617](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5617)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- types: Add GoDoc about named types (authored by @wata727)\r\n- deps: Remove `github.com/pkg/errors` dependency (authored by @Iceber)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n- Update entrypoint documentation ([#5565](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5565)) authored by @johanfylling reported by @robertgartman\r\n- Add missing folder argument in bundle build example (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Clarify `crypto.x509.parse_certificates` docs (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Added AWS S3 Web Identity Credentials info to tutorial (authored by @vishrana)\r\n- docs/graphql: non-nullable id argument and typo fix (authored by @philipaconrad)\r\n\r\n### Website + Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Ecosystem:\r\n  -

The full list is below, but here are some of our favorites:\r\n- [`kustomize localize`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/cmd/localize/): a brand new alpha command that localizes remote content. You\u2019ll be able to `build` the localized kustomization without network access and performance delays! Please give it a try and let us know what you think in #4996. See more details in its entry under Features below.\r\n- support for four new Helm fields, by popular request: `additionalValuesFiles`, `skipTests`, `apiVersions` and `skipTests`\r\n- A new [`sortOptions` kustomization field](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/sortoptions/) gives you fine-grained control over resource ordering in build output\r\n- Significant performance improvements!\r\n\r\nA HUGE thank you to everyone who contributed to this release! \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- #4930: Remove deprecated alpha cfg and fn commands: `kustomize fn sink`, `kustomize fn source`, `kustomize fn wrap`, `kustomize fn xargs`, `kustomize cfg annotate`, `kustomize cfg create-setter`, `kustomize cfg delete-setter`, `kustomize cfg delete-substitution`, `kustomize cfg create-substitution`, `kustomize cfg fmt`, `kustomize cfg init`, `kustomize cfg list-setters`, `kustomize cfg merge`, `kustomize cfg merge3`, `kustomize cfg set`.\r\n- #4983, #4954, #4922, #4900, #4885: Warning: We made major improvements to the maintainability of the URL-parsing code for remote URLs, fixing several bugs in the process. We have test coverage for backwards-compatibility with all documented supported URLs, but if you experience a regression with a remote URL, please file an issue.\r\n  - #4985: If you previously included .git in an AWS or Azure URL, we will no longer automatically remove that suffix. You may need to add an extra `/` to replace the .git for the URL to properly resolve.\r\n  - #4954: Drop support for using `gh:` as a host (e.g. `gh:kubernetes-sigs/kustomize`). We were unable to find any usage of or basis for this and believe it may have been targeting a custom gitconfig shorthand syntax.\r\n- #4911: Drop support for a very old, legacy style of patches. `patches` used to be allowed to be used as an alias for `patchesStrategicMerge` in kustomize v3. You now have to use `patchesStrategicMerge` explicitly, or update to the new syntax supported by `patches`. See examples in the PR description of #4911.\r\n- #4731: Remove a potential build-time side-effect in ConfigMapGenerator and SecretGenerator, which loaded values from the local environment under some circumstances, breaking `kustomize build`'s side-effect-free promise. While this behavior was never intended, we deprecated it and are announcing it as a breaking change since it existed for a long time. See also the Eschewed Features documentation.\r\n- #4929: Duplicate fields in Kustomization files will now result in an error instead of them silently being ignored in an undefined order.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n- #4723, #4923: We are deprecating the following kustomization fields. **These fields will never be removed from the kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 Kustomization API**, but they will not be included in the kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1 Kustomization API. When Kustomization v1 is available, we will announce the deprecation of the v1beta1 version. There will be at least two releases between deprecation and removal of Kustomization v1beta1 support from the kustomize CLI, and removal itself will happen in a future major version bump.\r\n  - patchesStrategicMerge. Please use [patches](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/) instead\r\n  - patchesJson6902. Please use [patches](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patches/) instead\r\n  - vars. Please use [replacements](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/replacements/) instead.\r\n  - imageTags. This is an alias for [images](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/images/), please switch to images.\r\n- #5000: The `--short` flag for `kustomize version` is deprecated.\r\n- #4954: Deprecate RepoSpec `git::` prefix, which is invalid. Kustomize currently strips it, but will stop doing so in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- #4652: New [`kustomize localize` command](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/cmd/localize/) to download any remote content from your kustomization directory and create a new, localized copy with file paths to the local content replacing the URLs. Please leave your feedback here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/4996\r\n- #4019: New [kustomization field `sortOptions`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/sortoptions/), that lets you configure the sort order of resources.\r\n- #4733: `kustomize edit fix` converts `patchesStrategicMerge` to `patches`\r\n- #4947: Allow fieldspecs (used in advanced transformer configuration) to start with a slash.\r\n- #5000: Output of `kustomize version` is improved.

tool.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Distributed Deployment Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide).\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade from v2.0.1 to v2.1.0\r\n* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/master/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB\r\n* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:\r\n  * apollo-configservice\r\n  * apollo-adminservice\r\n  * apollo-portal\r\n* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204\r\n```sql\r\nuse ApolloPortalDB;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;\r\ndelete

histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float histograms),\r\nit is a one-way street since older versions do not support float histograms.\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format

Proxy-defaults and service-defaults config entries were not correctly merged for implicit upstreams in transparent proxy mode and would result in some configuration not being applied. To avoid issues when upgrading, ensure that any proxy-defaults or service-defaults have correct configuration for upstreams, since all fields will now be properly used to configure proxies. [[GH-16000](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/16000)]\r\n* peering: Newly created peering connections must use only lowercase characters in the `name` field. Existing peerings with uppercase characters will not be modified, but they may encounter issues in various circumstances. To maintain forward compatibility and avoid issues, it is recommended to destroy and re-create any invalid peering connections so that they do not have a name containing uppercase characters.

For more information, see [CVE-2022-43758](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-34p5-jp77-fcrc).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where sensitive fields and credentials like secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys were stored as plaintext on Kubernetes objects. This is a follow-up security fix to address the fields missed in [CVE-2021-36782](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f). For more information, see [CVE-2022-43757](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-cq4p-vp5q-4522).\r\n\r\n- Improved the generation process of Rancher's `cattle-token` to make the token random. Before, `cattle-token` did not use any random value in its composition, which caused the token to be always predictable. For more information, see [CVE-2022-43755](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8c69-r38j-rpfj).\r\n\r\n- Fixed an authorization logic flaw that allowed an authenticated user on any downstream cluster to (1) open a shell pod in the Rancher local cluster and (2) have limited kubectl access to the local cluster. For more information, see [CVE-2022-21953](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g25r-gvq3-wrq7).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following security related updates were performed in this release to address security issues:\r\n\r\n- Fixed a validation check issue where Rancher generated tokens are not revoked after modifications are made to a configured authentication provider. This issue is only applicable if external authentication providers were configured in Rancher. For more information, see security advisory [GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-c45c-39f6-6gw9).\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of Rancher's Fleet chart to `101.0.1+up0.5.1` to address two security issues in [`rancher/wrangler`](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler) dependency:\r\n\r\n  - The high severity [CVE-2022-31249](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-qrg7-hfx7-95c5) that could lead to a command injection vulnerability in Rancher's Continuous Delivery feature through Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n  - The medium severity [CVE-2022-43756](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/security/advisories/GHSA-8fcj-gf77-47mg) that could cause a denial of service (DoS) attack in Fleet's GitJob pod.\r\n\r\n- Updated the version of [`crewjam/saml`](https://github.com/crewjam/saml) SAML library to address the critical severity [CVE-2022-41912](https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-j2jp-wvqg-wc2g).\r\n\r\n- Updated the base image version of Rancher `rancher/rancher` and Rancher Agent `rancher/rancher-agent` images from SUSE's SLE BCI Base 15 SP3 to 15 SP4 [`registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:15.4`](https://registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base-15sp4/index.html) due to 15 SP3 reaching its end-of-life (EOL).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) page or in Rancher's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue where handlers would infinitely loop if a user had no tokens, or the user only had tokens that did not have their ExtraByProvider field set. See [#39401](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39401).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Pods critical to running Rancher did not use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for its sidecar audit logging instead of busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. Rancher recommends admins to add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not be able to perform some of the actions within Azure AD if the permissions are insufficient, so you may encounter errors.\r\n- For RKE2/K3s node driver clusters, when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app, the behavior has changed for pulling images. Previously, only the global container registry was used. As of this release, by default, if a private registry exists in the cluster config, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. To change the default registry, a custom registry can be specified during the Helm chart install/upgrade workflow.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.1\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.24.6 (Default)\r\n- v1.23.12\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Provisioning new RKE1 clusters with a password-protected private registry may fail. See [#40321](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40321#issuecomment-1407095199) for a workaround and more information on the issue.\r\n    - In RKE1 clusters on Kubernetes v1.24, cadvisor `container` labels and metric series break Monitoring V2 dashboards. See [#38934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38934#issuecomment-1294585708) for a workaround and more details on the issue.\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Kubernetes RKE1 1.24.x clusters fail to reach an `Active` state using Oracle Linux 8.4; high CPU usage is also observed. Cluster could be a fresh installation or upgraded to v1.24.x. See [#38816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38816).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See Dashboard [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - Encryption keys may fail to rotate when there are a large number (> 2000) of secrets. See [#38283](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38283).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - The K3s proxied downstream cluster does not work on v1.24.4+k3s1 but does work on v1.24.6+k3s1. See [#39284](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39284).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - When upgrading RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the result may be that the first node will be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling is disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-01-24T17:33:32Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "3.10.45", "tag_name": "v3.10.45", "html_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/v3.10.45", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx", "body": "## Linux\n\n### amd64\n\n```shell\n# Download the archive and the cosign generated signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sig -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz.pem\n\n# Install cosign: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation\n# Verify using cosign\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --certificate jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz.pem --signature jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sig jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\ntar -zxvf jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### arm\n\n```shell\n# Download the archive and the cosign generated signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm.tar.gz -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm.tar.gz.sig -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm.tar.gz.pem\n\n# Install cosign: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation\n# Verify using cosign\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --certificate jx-linux-arm.tar.gz.pem --signature jx-linux-arm.tar.gz.sig jx-linux-arm.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf jx-linux-arm.tar.gz\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### arm64\n\n```shell\n# Download the archive and the cosign generated signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz.sig -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz.pem\n\n# Install cosign: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation\n# Verify using cosign\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --certificate jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz.pem --signature jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz.sig jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz\n\ntar -zxvf jx-linux-arm64.tar.gz\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n## macOS\n\n### amd64\n\n```shell\n# Download the archive and the cosign generated signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sig -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.pem\n\n# Install cosign: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation\n# Verify using cosign\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --certificate jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.pem --signature jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz.sig jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz\n\ntar -zxvf jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### arm64\n\n```shell\n# Download the archive and the cosign generated signature\ncurl -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sig -LO https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/3.10.45/jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.pem\n\n# Install cosign: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation\n# Verify using cosign\nCOSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --certificate jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.pem --signature jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sig jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz\n\ntar -zxvf jx-darwin-arm64.tar.gz\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\n```\n## Changes in version 3.10.45\n\n### Chores\n\n* deps: upgrade jenkins-x-plugins/jx-changelog to version 0.9.5 (jenkins-x-bot)\n\n-----\n\n# jenkins-x-plugins/jx-changelog\n\n### Linux\n\n```shell\ncurl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-changelog/releases/download/v0.9.5/jx-changelog-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv \nsudo mv jx-changelog /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n```shell\ncurl -L  https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-changelog/releases/download/v0.9.5/jx-changelog-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv\nsudo mv jx-changelog /usr/local/bin\n```\n\n## Changes in version 0.9.5\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* remove pointless function (M\u00e5rten Svantesson)\n", "created_at": "2023-01-24T15:43:41Z", "project": "JenkinsX", "repo": "jenkins-x/jx", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.44.0 \"Siamese Linguo\"", "tag_name": "v0.44.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.44.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "<!-- For major releases, add a tag line\r\n# \ud83c\udf89 [Tag Line -

"https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn", "body": "## Release Note\r\n**v1.4.0 released!** \ud83c\udf86\r\n\r\nThis release introduces many enhancements, improvements, and bug fixes as described below about stability, performance, data integrity, troubleshooting, and so on. Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- [Kubernetes 1.25 Support](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/important-notes/#pod-security-policies-disabled--pod-security-admission-introduction)\r\n  In the previous versions, Longhorn relies on Pod Security Policy (PSP) to authorize Longhorn components for privileged operations. From Kubernetes 1.25, PSP has been removed and replaced with Pod Security Admission (PSA). Longhorn v1.4.0 supports opt-in PSP enablement, so it can support Kubernetes versions with or without PSP.\r\n\r\n- [ARM64 GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4206)\r\n  ARM64 has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0. After receiving more user feedback and increasing testing coverage, ARM64 distribution has been stabilized with quality as per our regular regression testing, so it is qualified for general availability.\r\n\r\n- [RWX GA](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220727-dedicated-recovery-backend-for-rwx-volume-nfs-server.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/)\r\n  RWX has been experimental from Longhorn v1.1.0, but it lacks availability support when the Longhorn Share Manager component behind becomes unavailable. Longhorn v1.4.0 supports NFS recovery backend based on Kubernetes built-in resource, ConfigMap, for recovering NFS client connection during the fail-over period. Also, the NFS client hard mode introduction will further avoid previous potential data loss. For the detail, please check the issue and enhancement proposal.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Snapshot Checksum](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  Data integrity is a continuous effort for Longhorn. In this version, Snapshot Checksum has been introduced w/ some settings to allow users to enable or disable checksum calculation with different modes.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Bit-rot Protection](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220922-snapshot-checksum-and-bit-rot-detection.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#snapshot-data-integrity)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will periodically calculate and check the checksums of volume snapshots, find corrupted snapshots, then fix them.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Replica Rebuilding Speedup](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)\r\n  When enabling the Volume Snapshot Checksum feature, Longhorn will use the calculated snapshot checksum to avoid needless snapshot replication between nodes for improving replica rebuilding speed and resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Trim](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221103-filesystem-trim.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/trim-filesystem/#trim-the-filesystem-in-a-longhorn-volume)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports UNMAP SCSI command to reclaim space from the block volume.\r\n\r\n- [Online Volume Expansion](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/volumes-and-nodes/expansion)\r\n  Longhorn engine supports optional parameters to pass size expansion requests when updating the volume frontend to support online volume expansion and resize the filesystem via CSI node driver.\r\n\r\n- [Local Volume via Data Locality Strict Mode](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20200819-keep-a-local-replica-to-engine.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#default-data-locality)\r\n  Local volume is based on a new Data Locality setting, Strict Local. It will allow users to create one replica volume staying in a consistent location, and the data transfer between the volume frontend and engine will be through a local socket instead of the TCP stack to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.\r\n\r\n- [Volume Recurring Job Backup Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20201002-allow-recurring-backup-detached-volumes.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/snapshots-and-backups/backup-and-restore/restore-recurring-jobs-from-a-backup/)\r\n  Recurring jobs binding to a volume can be backed up to the remote backup target together with the volume backup metadata. They can be restored back as well for a better operation experience.\r\n\r\n- [Volume IO Metrics](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/monitoring/metrics/#volume)\r\n  Longhorn enriches Volume metrics by providing real-time IO stats including IOPS, latency, and throughput of R/W IO. Users can set up a monotoning solution like Prometheus to monitor volume performance.\r\n\r\n- [Longhorn System Backup & Restore](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20220913-longhorn-system-backup-restore.md)[[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/advanced-resources/system-backup-restore/)\r\n  Users can back up the longhorn system to the remote backup target. Afterward, it's able to restore back to an existing cluster in place or a new cluster for specific operational purposes.\r\n\r\n- [Support Bundle Enhancement](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759) [[lep]](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/enhancements/20221109-support-bundle-enhancement.md)\r\n  Longhorn introduces a new support bundle integration based on a general [support bundle kit](https://github.com/rancher/support-bundle-kit) solution. This can help us collect more complete troubleshooting info and simulate the cluster environment.\r\n\r\n- [Tunable Timeout between Engine and Replica](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491) [[doc]](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/references/settings/#engine-to-replica-timeout)\r\n  In the current Longhorn versions, the default timeout between the Longhorn engine and replica is fixed without any exposed user settings. This will potentially bring some challenges for users having a low-spec infra environment. By exporting the setting configurable, it will allow users adaptively tune the stability of volume operations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before installing Longhorn v1.4.0.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher App Marketplace, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n> **Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.21 before upgrading to Longhorn v1.4.0 from v1.3.x. Only support upgrading from 1.3.x.**\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.0/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Pod Security Policy is an opt-in setting. If installing Longhorn with PSP support, need to enable it first.\r\n- The built-in CSI Snapshotter sidecar is upgraded to v5.0.1. The v1beta1 version of Volume Snapshot custom resource is deprecated but still supported. However, it will be removed after upgrading CSI Snapshotter to 6.1 or later versions in the future, so please start using v1 version instead before the deprecated version is removed.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues after Release\r\n\r\nPlease follow up on [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Outstanding-Known-Issues-of-Releases) about any outstanding issues found after this release.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Reclaim/Shrink space of volume ([836](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/836)) - @yangchiu @derekbit @smallteeths @shuo-wu\r\n- [FEATURE] Backup/Restore Longhorn System ([1455](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1455)) - @c3y1huang @khushboo-rancher\r\n- [FEATURE] Online volume expansion ([1674](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1674)) - @shuo-wu @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Record recurring schedule in the backups and allow user choose to use it for the restored volume ([2227](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2227)) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [FEATURE] NFS support (RWX) GA ([2293](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2293)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Support metrics for Volume IOPS, throughput and latency real time ([2406](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2406)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Support bundle enhancement ([2759](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2759)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Automatic identifying of corrupted replica (bit rot detection) ([3198](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3198)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Local volume for distributed data workloads ([3957](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3957)) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Support K8s 1.25 by updating removed deprecated resource versions like PodSecurityPolicy ([4003](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4003)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Faster resync time for fresh replica rebuilding ([4092](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4092)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [FEATURE] Introduce checksum for snapshots ([4210](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4210)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [FEATURE] Update K8s version support and component/pkg/build dependencies ([4239](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4239)) - @yangchiu @PhanLe1010\r\n- [BUG] data corruption due to COW and block size not being aligned during rebuilding replicas  ([4354](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4354)) - @PhanLe1010 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT]  Adjust the iSCSI timeout and the engine-to-replica timeout settings ([4491](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4491)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Using specific block size in Longhorn volume's filesystem ([4594](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4594)) - @derekbit @roger-ryao\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Speed up replica rebuilding by the metadata such as ctime of snapshot disk files ([4783](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4783)) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- [FEATURE] Configure successfulJobsHistoryLimit of CronJobs ([1711](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1711)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Allow customization of the cipher used by cryptsetup in volume encryption ([3353](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/3353)) - @mantissahz @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] New setting to limit the concurrent volume restoring from backup ([4558](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4558)) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [FEATURE] Make FS format options configurable in storage class ([4642](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/4642)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n\r\n## Improvement\r\n\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Change the script into a docker run command mentioned in 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc ([1521](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1521)) - @weizhe0422 @chriscchien\r\n- [IMPROVEMENT] Improve 'recovery from longhorn backup without system installed' doc.

This release is a new effort and is not related to a previous preview of code released in the [2.x-archive](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/tree/2.x-archive) branch which was an experimental re-architecture of Eureka.\r\n\r\nThe Eureka Server HTTP API and wire data formats *have not changed* for the 2.0.0 release. Eureka servers and clients should be backwards and forwards compatible over the wire. This release was primarily driven for compatibility with [Spring Framework 6.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga) and [Spring Boot 3.0](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/24/spring-boot-3-0-goes-ga) and the change to [Jakarta EE 9](https://jakarta.ee/release/9/).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\nThe Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API is not backwards compatible with 1.x.\r\nEureka 1.x included support for Jersey 1 and optional Support for Jersey 2. In many cases, Jersey 1 was the default and was baked into the `eureka-core` and `eureka-client` modules. Having a default client has been removed. The new `eureka-client-jersey3` and `eureka-core-jersey3` should now be used if no other implementation is provided (such as Spring Cloud support for a `RestTemplate` implementation).\r\nThe [`DiscoveryClient constructors`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/b03151940fe2a647bb0697bb0c6f1057f4db46e8/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java#L236-L279) have been updated to have a new required [`TransportClientFactories`](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/blob/2.x/eureka-client/src/main/java/com/netflix/discovery/shared/transport/jersey/TransportClientFactories.java) parameter. The majority of the Eureka 2.0.0 Java client API has remained unchanged.\r\nAll references to `javax.*` classes have been changed to `jakarta.*` classes and the appropriate modules have been added.\r\nThe `eureka-server-governator` module was removed. There is no current support for the JakartaEE version of `@Inject`.\r\nThe `eureka-server` module currently does not build a functional WAR file. The recommended way of creating a Eureka 2.0.0 server is via Spring Cloud Netflix as a Spring Boot application.\r\nThe build now requires JDK 11 because of some tests that require Jetty and the version of Jetty that supports Jakarta EE 9 requires Java 11. The build still targets Java 8.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease try things out and provide any feedback or issues at https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues.\r\n", "created_at":

fixing a bug loading docker hub / docker.io tagged images with identical content but different tags (including images with no explicit host) https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/2955\r\nand support for cross-architecture `kind load ...`.\r\n\r\nThis release also ships Kubernetes 1.25.3 and containerd 1.6.9 with their respective fixes.\r\n\r\nThis release comes to you live from KubeCon NA 2022 \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.25.3` image: `kindest/node:v1.25.3@sha256:f52781bc0d7a19fb6c405c2af83abfeb311f130707a0e219175677e366cc45d1`\r\n- Internal config generation now defends against yaml-injection\r\n  - This should not be a breaking change if you were using the config fields as documented\r\n  - This does not apply to config *patches* which are applied after config generation, and by definition patch arbitrary yaml\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- **Support for loading cross-architecture images**\r\n  - When using `kind load docker-image` or `kind load image-archive`, \r\n  kind now instructs containerd to import all architectures.\r\n  - This means that *if* you have multi-arch `docker run` enabled on your host (binfmt_misc qemu-userspace),\r\n  such as in the Docker Desktop application out-of-the box, you may be able to load and run pods with images\r\n  for the wrong architecture (e.g. an amd64 image on an M1 mac).\r\n- containerd 1.6.9\r\n- go 1.19.2\r\n- upgraded metallb https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/2973\r\n- overhauled docs code snippets https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/2894\r\n\r\nNew Node images have been built for kind `v0.17.0`, please use these **exact** images (IE like `kindest/node:v1.25.3@sha256:f52781bc0d7a19fb6c405c2af83abfeb311f130707a0e219175677e366cc45d1` including the digest) or build your own as we may need to change the image format again in the future :sweat_smile:\r\n\r\nImages built for this release:\r\n  - 1.25: `kindest/node:v1.25.3@sha256:f52781bc0d7a19fb6c405c2af83abfeb311f130707a0e219175677e366cc45d1`\r\n  -

It remains possible to build custom images for other architectures (see the docs).\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"fixes\">Fixes</h1>\r\n\r\n- Fix loading docker hub / docker.io tagged images with identical content but different tags (including images with no explicit host) https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/pull/2955\r\n- [kindnetd](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/images/kindnetd) (kind's lightweight networking daemonset) now supports removing wrong routes when nodes are added and removed\r\n  - currently, kind does not explicitly have support for adding or removing nodes\r\n    however, [Cluster API Provider Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test/infrastructure/docker) (which is based on KIND), does support this.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.3.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 1.0.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.3.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 1.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.6.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.7.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.3.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.9.0 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 2.0.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.5.1 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.10 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* CNCF infra migration (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3511)\r\n* Fixed imagePullSecrets error for jiva helm chart\r\n* enforce quotas for hostpath with an ext4 filesystem for LocalPV Hostpath\r\n* enhanced the NDM to include path filter for custom udev rules.\r\n* add logs in cstor for better debuggability\r\n* added rate limiter to reduce log flood issue in LocalPV LVM\r\n* updated the csidriver CRD to v1 version for LocalPV device\r\n* fixed BDD failure for LocalPV Device\r\n* refactored LVM LocalPV to use dynamic client\r\n* arm64 infra support for Mayastor\r\n* fixed the default scheduler for LVM LocalPV\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @cxfcxf (Xuefeng Chen) for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/adopters/magnite/README.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?
