OpenTelemetry and opa exec\r\n\r\nThis release adds OpenTelemetry support to OPA. This makes it possible to emit spans to an OpenTelemetry collector via gRPC on both incoming and outgoing (i.e. http.send) calls in the server. See the updated docs on [monitoring](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/monitoring/) for more information and configuration options ([#1469](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/1469)) authored by @[rvalkenaers](https://github.com/rvalkenaers)\r\n\r\nThis release also adds a new `opa exec` command for doing one-off evaluations of policy against input similar to `opa eval`, but using the full capabilities of the server (config file, plugins, etc). This is particularly useful in contexts such as CI/CD or when enforcing policy for infrastructure as code, where one might want to run OPA with remote bundles and decision logs but without having a running server.

It updates Kubernetes to [v1.23.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220)\r\n\r\nAs this release includes a number of significant changes from previous versions, we will not make v1.23 available via the [stable release channel](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/upgrades/basic/#release-channels) until v1.23.2+k3s1 or later.\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes [Urgent Upgrade Notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#urgent-upgrade-notes).  \r\n\r\n## Known Issues: \r\n* [#4881](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4881): When using embedded etcd and the initial server is started with --agent-token, and this agent-only token does not match the server --token value, additional servers cannot join the cluster. This will be fixed in a subsequent release.\r\n* [#4023](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4023): When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.\r\n* [#4784](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/4784): When creating a new cluster, etcd-only servers (if any) must be created before control-plane servers.\r\n\r\n## Changes since K3s v1.22.2-rc2+k3s1 (when the **release-1.22** branch was forked from **master**)\r\n* Update kubernetes to v1.23 ([#4623](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4623))\r\n* Bump stable to v1.22.5+k3s1 ([#4821](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4821))\r\n* Backout accidental package renaming ([#4817](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4817))\r\n* Fix panic checking name of uninitialized etcd member ([#4813](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4813))\r\n* Fix multiple ci issues blocking 1.23 release ([#4801](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4801))\r\n* Update bootstrap logic to output all changed files on disk ([#4800](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4800))\r\n* Remove the vendor directory ([#4791](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4791))\r\n* Move flannel logs to logrus ([#4796](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4796))\r\n* Close agentready channel only in k3s ([#4792](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4792))\r\n* K3s no longer leaks etcd client grpc connections ([#4745](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4745))\r\n* Remove disables, skips and disablekubeproxy from the comparing configs ([#4781](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4781))\r\n* Add initial skeleton adopters.md to better track large use cases ([#4764](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/4764))\r\n* The embedded containerd binary is no longer part of the k3s multicall bundle.

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/36).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add ability to analyze the correlation between two queries on a single graph. Just click `+Query` button, enter the second query in the newly appeared input field and press `Ctrl+Enter`. Results for both queries should be displayed simultaneously on the same graph. Every query has its own vertical scale, which is displayed on the left and the right side of the graph. Lines for the second query are dashed. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1916).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add ability to override the interval between returned datapoints. By default it is automatically calculated depending on the selected time range and horizontal resolution of the graph. Now it is possible to override it with custom values. This may be useful during data exploration and debugging.\r\n* FEATURE: accept optional `extra_filters[]=series_selector` query args at Prometheus query APIs additionally to `extra_label` query args. This allows enforcing additional filters for all the Prometheus query APIs by using [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html) or [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html). See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1863).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmauth.html): allow specifying `http` and `https` urls in `-auth.config` command-line flag. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1898). Thanks for @TFM93 .\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): allow specifying `http` and `https` urls in the following command-line flags: `-promscrape.config`, `-remoteWrite.relabelConfig` and `-remoteWrite.urlRelabelConfig`.\r\n* FEATURE: vminsert: allow specifying `http` and `https` urls in `-relabelConfig` command-line flag.\r\n* FEATURE: vminsert: add `-maxLabelValueLen` command-line flag for the ability to configure the maximum length of label value. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1908).\r\n* FEATURE: preserve the order of time series passed to [limit_offset](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#limit_offset) function. This allows implementing series paging via `limit_offset(limit, offset, sort_by_label(...))`. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1920) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/951) issues.\r\n* FEATURE: automaticall convert `(value1|...|valueN)` into `{value1,...,valueN}` inside `__graphite__` pseudo-label. This allows using [Grafana multi-value template variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/formatting-multi-value-variables/) inside `__graphite__` pseudo-label. For example, `{__graphite__=~\"foo.($bar)\"}` is expanded to `{__graphite__=~\"foo.{x,y}\"}` if both `x` and `y` are selected for `$bar` template variable. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#selecting-graphite-metrics) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: add [timestamp_with_name](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#timestamp_with_name) function. It works the same as [timestamp](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#timestamp), but leaves the original time series names, so it can be used in queries, which match multiple time series names: `timestamp_with_name({foo=\"bar\"}[1h])`. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/949#issuecomment-995222388) for more context.\r\n* FEATURE: add [changes_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#changes_prometheus), [increase_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#increase_prometheus) and [delta_prometheus](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#delta_prometheus) functions, which don't take into account the previous sample before the given lookbehind window specified in square brackets. These functions may be used when the Prometheus behaviour for `changes()`, `increase()` and `delta()` functions is needed to be preserved. VictoriaMetrics uses slightly different behaviour for `changes()`, `increase()` and `delta()` functions by default - see [this article](https://medium.com/@romanhavronenko/victoriametrics-promql-compliance-d4318203f51e) for details. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1962).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: fix `unaligned 64-bit atomic operation` panic on 32-bit architectures, which has been introduced in v1.70.0. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1944).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): restore the ability to use `$labels.alertname` in labels templating. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1921).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): add missing `query` caption to the input field for the query. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1900).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix navigation over query history with `Ctrl+up/down` and fix zoom relatively to the cursor position. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1936).\r\n* BUGFIX: deduplicate samples more thoroughly if [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) is enabled. Previously some duplicate samples may be left on disk for time series with high churn rate. This may result in bigger storage space requirements.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): follow up to 5 redirects when `follow_redirects: true` is set for a particular scrape config. Previously only a single redirect was performed in this case. It is expected these redirects are performed to the original hostname. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1945).\r\n* BUGFIX: de-duplicate data exported via [/api/v1/export/csv](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-export-csv-data) by default if [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) is enabled.

Refer [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35955#issuecomment-1000641550) to work around this issue.\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### New Experimental Features\r\n\r\nKubernetes v1.22 is being introduced in Rancher v2.6.3 as an experimental feature. As such, Rancher doesn't support provisioning 1.22 clusters or having Rancher run on 1.22 clusters at this time. Support will become available at a later time.\r\n\r\n### New in Harvester\r\n\r\n- Harvester v1.0.0 is GA and is only supported by Rancher v2.6.3.\r\n- Harvester v0.3.0 is not supported by Rancher v2.6.3. You must delete your Harvester v0.3.0 cluster from Rancher before upgrading Rancher.\r\n- Virtualization Management\r\n  - Importing a Harvester cluster no longer needs the manual `kubectl` command. Refer [here](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/virtualization-management/) for details.\r\n- RKE1\r\n  - Rancher provisioned RKE1 clusters now support installing Harvester Cloud Provider Chart and CSI Driver Chart.  No more manual configuration is needed.\r\n  - Additional UI enhancement has been added to the RKE1 Load Balancer page to support the Harvester Load Balancer configuration. No more manual annotation is needed.\r\n  - Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/cloud-provider/) for more details. \r\n- RKE2\r\n  - Rancher provisioned RKE2 clusters will have Harvester Load Balancer and CSI driver installed automatically.\r\n  - Additional UI enhancement has been added to the RKE2 Load Balancer page to support the Harvester Load Balancer configuration.\r\n  - Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/cloud-provider/) for more details. \r\n\r\n### UI Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Scaling up or down of a workload is now enabled in the Rancher UI. See [#4328](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4328).\r\n- The scale and health status of a workload is now visible in workload view. See [#4329](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4329).\r\n- Added ability to pause orchestration for workloads. See [#4331](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4331).\r\n- Added dashboards for workload metrics into the Rancher UI. See [#1879](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/1879).\r\n- Support added to Azure node driver to use images from Apps & Marketplace. See [#33518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33518).\r\n- UI page load times improved. See [#34721](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34721).\r\n\r\n### Security Enhancements\r\n\r\n- By default, only passwords with at least 12 characters are accepted per new password policy in Rancher. See [#34851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34851).\r\n- Starting with v1.22, RKE1 no longer rewrites SELinux labels on container volume mounts. Please see the [security docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/security/selinux/) for information on how to install the rancher-selinux RPM to ensure SELinux policies are configured. See [#2541](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2541) for reference.\r\n\r\n### Other New Features\r\n\r\n- Authorized Cluster Endpoint can now be enabled on downstream imported RKE2/K3s clusters. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/registered-clusters/#authorized-cluster-endpoint-support-for-rke2-and-k3s-clusters) and [#35161](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35161) for details.\r\n- The Rancher Monitoring chart has been upgraded to match the upstream `kube-prometheus-stack` version 19.0.3. See [#34577](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34577).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue in which RKE1 and RKE2 Clusters were becoming stuck in Removing state. See [#35180](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35180).\r\n- Rancher-related namespaces are now removed after cluster agents are removed on imported provider clusters. See [#34990](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34990).\r\n- Fixed issue in which cluster failed to communicate with API server after etcd role node is removed. See [#34488](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34488).\r\n- Downstream clusters behind a proxy are now supported when RKE2 cluster is upgraded. See [#32633](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32633).\r\n- The API Server has been updated to fix slow consumers causing deadlocks. See [#34906](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34906).\r\n- When in installed apps under Apps & Marketplace in a cluster, navigating to workloads after selecting namespace works. See [#4428](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4428). \r\n \r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows. \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:** \r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.\r\n  - When using Kubernetes v1.21 with Windows Server 20H2 Standard Core, the patch \"2019-08 Servicing Stack Update for Windows Server\" must be installed on the node. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n- **Users must manually remove legacy services.** When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.  See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).\r\n- **Charts from library and helm3-library catalogs can no longer be launched.** Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n- **The Fleet agent in the local cluster now lives in `cattle-fleet-local-system`.** Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **New steps for rolling back Rancher.** The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters.** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **New procedure to set up Azure cloud provider for RKE2.** For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs Kube Nodes.** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Rancher's External IP Webhook chart no longer supported in v1.22.** In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs.**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Legacy Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.3\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.6.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.3](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.3)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.22.4 (Experimental)\r\n- v1.21.7 (Default)\r\n- v1.20.13\r\n- v1.19.16\r\n- v1.18.20\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nFeature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tWe have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\nThe following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring V1 \r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Actions that can\u2019t be performed by a cluster member, `Download KubeConfig` and `Take Snapshot`, are being shown as available on RKE1 clusters in a Rancher setup. See [#35828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35828).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Tech Preview:** There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace. See [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support upgrading RKE2 versions. See Windows [#76](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/76).\r\n    - Rancher v2.6.3 cannot deploy RKE2 Windows clusters with versions 1.21.6+rke2r1 and below due to system agent updates. Note that RKE2 clusters with v1.21.7rc2 and higher are compatible with Rancher v2.6.3. See [#122](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/122). \r\n    - When provisioning using a RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - RKE2 clusters are not able to be provisioned using the AWS cloud provider in Kubernetes v1.22. Note that RKE2 clusters in v1.21 function as expected. See [#35618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35618).\r\n    - Standard users will not be able to create a cluster after clicking the `Edit as YAML` button. They will receive an error even if attempting to then `Edit as a Form`. To work around this issue, start over and create the cluster without clicking the `Edit as YAML` button. See [#35868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35868).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **AWS:**\r\n    - In an HA Rancher server on Kubernetes v1.20, ingresses on AWS EC2 node driver clusters do not go through and result in a `failed calling webhook` error. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754#issuecomment-995566492) and [#35754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**  \r\n    - The vSphere CSI Driver does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to unsupported v1beta1 CRD APIs. Support will be added in a later release, but in the meantime users with the `CSIMigrationvSphere` feature enabled should not\r\n    upgrade to Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33848](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33848).\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n    - Monitoring fails to upgrade when CRD is in a failed state. To work around this issue, use Helm to install the `rancher-monitoring` chart into the cluster directly, rather than using the Rancher UI. In order to set nodeSelector or tolerations to the `rancher-monitoring-crd` chart, you need to install the `rancher-monitoring-crd` and `rancher-monitoring` chart by using the Helm command via command line. Rancher UI will add support soon. See [#35744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35744).\r\n    - When deploying a cluster on v1.22, the pod `rancher-monitoring-admission-patch` fails and times out, which causes the Monitoring install to fail. To deploy the rancher-monitoring chart successfully in RKE1/RKE2 1.22.x, please see [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35571#issuecomment-991140220). See also [#35571](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35571).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. Everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).\r\n    - In Istio v1.10.4, Kubernetes IP service is set to default IP, which does not work for all environments. To work around this issue, install Istio version 100.1.0+up1.11.4 in the downstream cluster, and installation will complete successfully. Note that the new install will not include the Kiali CRD. See [#35339](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35339). \r\n    - Istio 100.1.0+up1.11.4 no longer installs the Kiali CRD because it was removed from the upstream Helm chart starting in Kiali version 1.36. If you have upgraded from a previous version of rancher-istio installed to 100.1.0+up1.11.4, you will need to manually delete the `rancher-kiali-server-crd` found on the installed apps page, since it is no longer in use after the upgrade completes. See [#35686](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35686) for more information.\r\n    - A `failed calling webhook \"validation.istio.io\"` error will occur in air-gapped environments if the `istiod-istio-system` `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` exists, and you attempt a fresh install of Istio 1.11.x and higher. To work around this issue, run the command `kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration istiod-istio-system` and attempt your install again. See [#35742](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35742#issuecomment-994801502).\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n    - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).\r\n    - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).\r\n- **Docker installs:** \r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n- **Login to Rancher using ActiveDirectory with TLS:** See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).\r\n  - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an ActiveDirectory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Golang v1.15.\r\n  - The error received is \"Error creating ssl connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\"\r\n  - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting \"GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\" as an environment variable to Rancher server container.\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After clicking on the header of an expanded navigation group, the navigation group remains unchanged. See [#4368](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4368).  \r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt.

The [lifecycle](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle) should be used directly when building on cloud platforms.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- The [Docker daemon](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your workstation or accessible over the network.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nFor instructions on installing `pack`, see our [installation docs](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/cli/install/).\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nRun the command `pack`.\r\n\r\nYou should see the following output\r\n\r\n```text\r\nCLI for building apps using Cloud Native Buildpacks\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  pack [command]\r\n\r\nAvailable Commands:\r\n  build                 Generate app image from source code\r\n  builder               Interact with builders\r\n  buildpack             Interact with buildpacks\r\n  config                Interact with your local pack config file\r\n  inspect               Show information about a built app image\r\n  stack                 Interact with stacks\r\n  rebase                Rebase app image with latest run image\r\n  completion            Outputs completion script location\r\n  report                Display useful information for reporting an issue\r\n  version               Show current 'pack' version\r\n  help                  Help about any command\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n  -h, --help         Help for 'pack'\r\n      --no-color     Disable color output\r\n  -q, --quiet        Show less output\r\n      --timestamps   Enable timestamps in output\r\n  -v, --verbose      Show more output\r\n      --version      Show current 'pack' version\r\n\r\nUse \"pack [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Info\r\n\r\nBuilders created with this release of the pack CLI contain [lifecycle v0.13.1](https://github.com/buildpack/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.13.1) by default.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Remove outdated acceptance tests constraints (#1340 by @dfreilich)\r\n* Bump lifecycle to 0.13.1 to include sbom patches (#1339 by @samj1912)\r\n* Configure gitpod test execution to work out-of-the-box (#1337 by @jromero)\r\n* Add support for platform api 0.7 and 0.8 (#1334 by @samj1912)\r\n* SSH test improvement: use Go SSH server not containerized OpenSSH  (#1327 by @matejvasek)\r\n* Add file explorer to pack-interact workflow (#1326 by @aemengo)\r\n* Fix help text for StringArrayVar flags (#1323 by @vindvaki)\r\n* Complete pack-interact workflow (#1278 by @aemengo)\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\n* Fix default buildpack API version.

to `v2.5.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n- 1.16.10: Both release executables and Docker images are built with this Go release.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Profiler:\r\n    - Moved the start of the profiler earlier in the start sequence so it is possible to get some insight should a start take a long time (for instance recovering JetStream datastore) (#2723)\r\n- Added `LEAFNODE_WS` in `allowed_connection_types` to allow or prevent Leafnode over websocket. Previously, if `allowed_connection_types` was specified and contained `LEAFNODE`, this user could be used to create a Leafnode connection over websocket. The existing `WEBSOCKET` connection type is used for regular client applications (#2707)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Slowness with large interior deletes (#2711)\r\n    - Possible panic when removing a source from a stream. Thanks to @kylebernhardy for the report (#2712)\r\n    - Reject invalid subjects in stream configuration, and attempt to fix them on recovery (#2717, #2721)\r\n    - Prevent stream update to add subjects to mirror and remove them on recovery (#2718, #2721)\r\n    - Application may receive corrupted headers when receiving from a consumer configured with \"MetaOnly\" option (#2719)\r\n    - Aligned internal timeout to 4 seconds for stream and consumer list requests (#2722)\r\n    - Incomplete error when consumer list in cluster mode failed (#2725)\r\n- Leafnode:\r\n    - When using `allowed_connection_types`, it was not possible to restrict a Leafnode connection over websocket (#2707)\r\n    - Reaching the account connections limit left an outgoing Leafnode connection in a bad state (#2715)\r\n- Monitoring:\r\n    - TLS configuration changes would not take effect after a configuration reload (#2714)\r\n- Documentation:\r\n    - Links in the README.

Thank you!\r\n\r\nA broad range of improvements, including support for cloud services such as Memcached auto-discovery and Amazon SNS.\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Expose default configuration values to the command line options. Note that setting these explicitly to zero will no longer cause the default to be used. If the default is desired, then do set the option.

These metrics can be enabled with the `-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). #4343\r\n* [FEATURE] AlertManager: Add support for SNS Receiver. #4382\r\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add label `status` to metric `cortex_distributor_ingester_append_failures_total` #4442\r\n* [FEATURE] Queries: Added `present_over_time` PromQL function, also some TSDB optimisations. #4505\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add timeout for waiting on compactor to become ACTIVE in the ring. #4262\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce memory used by streaming queries, particularly in ruler. #4341\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow experimental configuration of disabling of heartbeat timeouts by setting the relevant configuration value to zero. Applies to the following: #4342\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow heartbeats to be explicitly disabled by setting the interval to zero. This is considered experimental. This applies to the following configuration options: #4344\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ingester.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: optimized receive path for processing ring state updates, to help reduce CPU utilization in large clusters. #4345\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: expose configuration of memberlist packet compression via `-memberlist.compression=enabled`. #4346\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Go version to 1.16.6. #4362\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated Prometheus to include changes from prometheus/prometheus#9083. Now whenever `/labels` API calls include matchers, blocks store is queried for `LabelNames` with matchers instead of `Series` calls which was inefficient. #4380\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: performance improvements in socket and memory handling. #4429 #4377\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Exemplars are now emitted for all gRPC calls and many operations tracked by histograms. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New options `-server.http-listen-network` and `-server.grpc-listen-network` allow binding as 'tcp4' or 'tcp6'. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rulers: Using shuffle sharding subring on GetRules API. #4466\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support memcached auto-discovery via `auto-discovery` flag, introduced by thanos in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4487. Both AWS and Google Cloud memcached service support auto-discovery, which returns a list of nodes of the memcached cluster. #4412\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixes a panic in the query-tee when comparing result. #4465\r\n* [BUGFIX] Frontend: Fixes @ modifier functions (start/end) when splitting queries by time. #4464\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: compactor will no longer try to compact blocks that are already marked for deletion. Previously compactor would consider blocks marked for deletion within `-compactor.deletion-delay / 2` period as eligible for compaction. #4328\r\n* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker: when cleaning up obsolete elected replicas from KV store, tracker didn't update number of cluster per user correctly. #4336\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed counting of PromQL evaluation errors as user-errors when updating `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`. #4335\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: When using block storage, prevent any reads or writes while the ingester is stopping. This will prevent accessing TSDB blocks once they have been already closed. #4304\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed ingester stuck on start up (LEAVING ring state) when `-ingester.heartbeat-period=0` and `-ingester.unregister-on-shutdown=false`. #4366\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: panic during shutdown while fetching batches from cache. #4397\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: After query-frontend restart, querier may have lower than configured concurrency. #4417\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: forward only changes, not entire original message. #4419\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: don't accept old tombstones as incoming change, and don't forward such messages to other gossip members. #4420\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed panic when querying exemplars and using `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=false`. #4473\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: honor querier minT,maxT if `nil` SelectHints are passed to Select(). #4413\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed panic while collecting Prometheus metrics. #4483\r\n* [BUGFIX] Update go-kit package to fix spurious log messages #4544\r\n", "created_at": "2021-11-25T15:16:47Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Flux 1.24.3", "tag_name": "1.24.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/releases/tag/1.24.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux", "body": "### [Flux v1 is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320)\r\n\r\nAll users are encouraged to migrate to Flux v2 or begin planning their migration, and to continue filing issues if migrations are blocked.\r\n\r\n# 1.24.3 (2021-11-24)\r\n\r\nThis release includes the [new host keys][github.blog-2021-09-01] for GitHub, changes effective on November 16, that could be important for users of Flux.\r\n\r\nThis release also includes a base image upgrade to the Alpine 3.14.3 upstream that mitigates low and medium severity CVE warnings from the base image.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Add fingerprints for new github.com host keys [fluxcd/flux#3571][]\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to @kingdonb, @stefanprodan, @squaremo, and @hiddeco for their contributions to this release.\r\n\r\n[fluxcd/flux#3571]: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/pull/3571\r\n[github.blog-2021-09-01]: https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/", "created_at": "2021-11-24T13:50:00Z", "project": "Flux", "repo": "fluxcd/flux", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.6-dev0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/73dec76e853a03b9f06364e47c1266e81294d1d1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.6-dev0\n\nReleased version 2.6-dev0 with the following main changes :\n    - MINOR: version: it's development again", "created_at": "2021-11-23T14:50:11Z", "project": "HaProxy", "repo": "haProxy/haProxy", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.4.1", "tag_name": "v1.4.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/m3db/m3/releases/tag/v1.4.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/m3db/m3", "body": "## Changelog\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- **M3Coordinator**: Do not Close singleton MessageProcessors when closing connections.

In addition, the following max hop limits will be set by default:\r\n\r\n * worker and API server Nodes, and bastions, will have a limit of 1 hop.\r\n * control plane nodes will have a limit of 3 hops to accommodate for controller Pods without host networking that need to assume roles.\r\n\r\nThis will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  instanceMetadata:\r\n    httpTokens: optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External ServiceAccountPermissions\r\n\r\nMany of kOps addons can now make direct use of external permissions.\r\nThis can be enabled by adding the following to the Cluster spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  iam:\r\n    useServiceAccountExternalPermissions: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only available using the AWS cloud provider.\r\n\r\n## Managed nvidia instances\r\n\r\nkOps can now provision instances with nvidia GPUs and configure it for container workloads without the need of hooks and operators. See [GPU support](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/gpu/)\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* New clusters on AWS will no longer provision an SSH public key by default. To provision\r\n  an SSH public key on a new cluster, use the `--ssh-public-key` flag to `kops create cluster`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. This defers changes to these files until the time of `terraform apply`.\r\n  This feature may be temporarily disabled by turning off the `TerraformManagedFiles` feature flag\r\n  using `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=\"-TerraformManagedFiles\"`.\r\n\r\n* kOps now implements graceful rotation of its Certificate Authorities and the service\r\n  account signing key. See the documentation on [How to rotate all secrets / credentials](../operations/rotate-secrets.md)\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports Debian 11 (Bullseye).\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) as a drop-in replacement for dns-controller.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Control plane pods no longer mount /srv/kubernetes\r\n\r\n For security reasons, `/srv/kubernetes` is no longer mounted in the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager Pods. This also means the files in the default file assets path will be unavailable. If you have file assets or other files needed by kube-apiserver, you must put these into `/srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/` or `/srv/kubernetes/kube-controller-manager`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor file assets, it means adding an explicit path as shown below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  fileAssets:\r\n  - name: audit-policy-config\r\n    path: /srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/audit-policy-config.yaml # make sure you add the path\r\n    roles:\r\n    - Master\r\n    content: |\r\n      apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\r\n      kind: Policy\r\n      rules:\r\n      - level: Metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The legacy addons from `https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons` have been deprecated and will not be available in Kubernetes 1.23+. Use [managed addons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons) instead.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The `assets` phase of `kops update cluster` has been removed. It is replaced by the new `kops get assets --copy` command.\r\n\r\n* Support for importing and converting kubeup clusters has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Cilium and RHEL 8 has been removed. Cilium users will need to migrate to a distribution with a newer Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n* Amazon Linux 2 users are encouraged to use the AMIs based on the 5.10 Linux kernel. See [the documentation](../operations/images.md#amazon-linux-2) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Terraform support now requires Terraform >=0.15.0.\r\n  Users on older versions must follow Terraform's recommended upgrade path of applying one minor version at a time prior to running `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. If, after upgrading kOps and applying a new Terraform plan,\r\n  you subsequently downgrade to an earlier version of kOps, the generated plan will delete these\r\n  files, breaking the cluster. Prior to applying the plan, you will need to orphan all the\r\n  `aws_s3_bucket_object` objects the plan wants to destroy. Use `terraform state rm` on each of them.\r\n  Then re-run `terraform plan` until there are no such objects in the plan.\r\n  \r\n  If you applied the plan without first orphaning all of these objects, fix the cluster by re-running\r\n  `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users of clusters with names beginning with digits will need to move resources prior to upgrading to kOps 1.22. Some of the following commands will need to be run depending on the particular cluster configuration. Confirm the Terraform plan doesn't destroy any of these resources before running `terraform apply`.\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # View the existing terraform resource names for the exact value to use\r\n  HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME=123-cluster-example-com\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_internet_gateway.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_internet_gateway.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_route_table.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_route_table.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* The `TerraformJSON` feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23. Only native HCL2 Terraform output will be supported.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* Support for shell completion has been substantially improved. kOps has added support for shell completion in `fish` and `PowerShell`.\r\n\r\n* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.\r\n\r\n* There is a new command `kops get assets` for listing image and file assets used by a cluster.\r\n  It also includes a `--copy` flag to copy the assets to local repositories.\r\n  See the documentation on [Using local asset repositories](../operations/asset-repository.md) for more information.\r\n  \r\n* kOps now provisions TLS server certificates signed by the Kubernetes general CA to kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.\r\n  The previous behavior of using self-signed certs may be restored by setting `kubeControllerManager.tlsCertFile` and/or\r\n  `kubeScheduler.tlsCertFile` to `\"\"` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now supports the wireguard protocol for transparent encryption.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.22.1 release\r\n\r\n## 1.22.1 to 1.22.2\r\n\r\n* Release 1.22.1

\ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 OpenEBS 3.0 is a culmination of efforts geared towards laying the foundation for making it easier to onboard and accept community contributions, making each of the data engine operators ready for future Kubernetes releases, making it easy to manage, and troubleshoot various data engines. This has been achieved via migration to the latest Kubernetes constructs, ease of use improvements, bug fixes and most importantly refactoring the control plane and e2e test suites to independently enhance and release each of the engines. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them till Dec 2021. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.0.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.0.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.8.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.5.1 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.7.1 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.7.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.4.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.7 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Added support for pushing the [container images to GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/packages), in addition to pushing the to DockerHub and Quay.io.\r\n* Rename the branches to \"develop\" or \"main\" on all the active repositories which are accepting contributions. \r\n* Update the CRD references to v1 across all components - even with deprecated provisioners - so users can continue to use the older provisioners beyond 1.22 as well. \r\n* Update the Kubernetes CSI driver side-cars to the latest version compatible with Kubernetes 1.18 and higher. \r\n* Enhance the iSCSI Targets functionality in Jiva and cStor volumes to only accept connections from one node at a time. The connection from a new node will be accepted only after the previous connection is torn down. \r\n* Enhanced the Local PV hostpath with a feature to enforce capacity limits using XFS quota - for volumes provisioned on XFS filesystem. \r\n* Enhanced the Jiva Specs (Jiva Volume Policy) to remove unused fields and make most of the fields with default configuration as optional. Also fixed the issues around specifying pod affinity and anti-affinity policies on jiva replica and target.\r\n* Enhanced the NDM operator and helm chart to include NDM exporter. \r\n* Enhanced NDM to detect filesystem and size changes, and update the block device resource. (under feature-gate in this release).\r\n* Dashboard and CLI have made enhanced their support to display details about cStor, Jiva, ZFS, LVM and Device Local PV. \r\n* Enhanced OpenEBS helm chart that can easily enable or disable a data engine of choice. The 3.0 helm chart stops installing the legacy cstor and jiva provisioners. If you would like to continue to use them, you have to set the flag \u201clegacy.enabled=true\u201d. \r\n* OpenEBS helm chart includes sample kyverno policies that can be used as an option for PodSecurityPolicies(PSP) replacement. \r\n* New revamped website for [https://openebs.io](https://openebs.io) is live. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @turowicz(Surveily), @WillyRL(Teknologi Anak Rantau Indonesia), @Somsubhra1, @t3hmrman for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?
