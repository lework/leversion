OPA can still be run with root privileges by explicitly setting the user,\r\n> either with the `--user` argument for `docker run`, or by specifying the `securityContext` in the Kubernetes Pod specification.\r\n>\r\n> * The minimum version of Go required to build the OPA module is **1.19**\r\n\r\nThis release contains a mix of new features, bugfixes and a new builtin function.\r\n\r\n### Honor `default` keyword on functions\r\n\r\nPreviously if a function was defined with a `default` value, OPA would ignore it. Now the `default` function is honored\r\nif all functions with the same name are undefined. For example,\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\ndefault clamp_positive(_) := 0\r\n\r\nclamp_positive(x) = x {\r\n    x > 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opa eval -d example.rego 'data.example.clamp_positive(1)' -f pretty\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opa eval -d example.rego 'data.example.clamp_positive(-1)' -f pretty\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of a `default` function follows the same conditions as that of a `default` rule. In addition, a `default`\r\nfunction satisfies the following properties:\r\n\r\n- same arity as other functions with the same name\r\n- arguments should only be plain variables ie. no composite values\r\n- argument names should not be repeated\r\n\r\n> **_NOTE:_**  \r\n> \r\n> `default` functions used to be previously ignored. If existing policies contain `default` functions, ensure that they conform\r\n> to the properties mentioned above. Otherwise, those policies will fail to evaluate.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n### New Built-In Function: crypto.parse_private_keys\r\n\r\n`crypto.parse_private_keys` returns zero or more private keys from the given encoded string containing DER certificate data.\r\nIf the input contains a list of one or more concatenated PEM blocks, then the built-in will output the parsed private keys\r\nrepresented as objects.\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation on the new built-in](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.55.0/policy-reference/#builtin-crypto-cryptoparse_private_keys)\r\nfor all the details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @volck.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- plugins/rest: Add AWS KMS support for OAuth2 Client Credentials JWT authentication ([#5942](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5942)) authored by @prasanthu\r\n- sdk: Update input object to conform to the format expected by decision log masking ([#6090](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6090)) authored by @epaulson10\r\n- sdk: Add option for specifying decision ID to SDK.

FATA[0001] Failed to install OLM version \"latest\": failed to create CRDs and resources: no matches for kind \"OLMConfig\" in version \"operators.coreos.com/v1\"```. Now, in this case, operator-sdk tries to create the resource again, until it succeeds (or until the timeout exceeded). ([#6490](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6490))\n- Fix a bug where `run bundle` command does not copy all FBC manifests into the new catalog image if custom index-image is passed.

Domainmapping webhook is merged with the Serving webhook. (#14082, @skonto)\r\n- DomainMapping/v1alpha1 is deprecated - use v1beta1 APIs (#14058, @dprotaso)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n- A new flag is introduced `queueproxy.resource-defaults` that sets resource requests, limits for Queue Proxy when enabled (applies only to cpu and memory). (#14039, @skonto)\r\n- Activator now has a separate service account, reducing its privileges to the required minimum. (#14133, @davidhadas)\r\n- Queue proxy resources can be configured via annotations at the service level.  The resource percentage annotation is now deprecated. (#14038, @skonto)\r\n- Sets DefaultDomain to cluster's domain instead of hardcoded `svc.cluster.local` (#13964, @kauana)\r\n\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1eBug Fixes\r\n- Autoscaler metric are validated with global autoscaling class if no class annotation is set. (#13978, @xtreme-vikram-yadav)\r\n- Drop `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` annotations on our control plane to allow nodes to drain (#14035, @dprotaso)\r\n- Fix activator load balancing when using unbounded concurrency and when you have two instances of a revision (#14028, @dprotaso)\r\n- Queue proxy metrics reporting period is now supported for both prometheus and opencensus.\r\n  This allows fine-grained control of how often metrics are exported via a new config map attribute. (#14019, @skonto)\r\n- Tag to digest min TLS version is 1.2 and can be configured higher using the controller environment variable `TAG_TO_DIGEST_TLS_MIN_VERSION` and supports values `\"1.2\"` and `\"1.3\"` (#13962, @dprotaso)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Added</summary>\r\n\r\n- cloud.google.com/go/accessapproval: v1.6.0\r\n- cloud.google.com/go/accesscontextmanager:

([#18537](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18537)).\r\n- The `podman pod create` command now supports a new flag, `--restart`, which sets the restart policy for all the containers in a pod.\r\n- The `--format={{.Restarts}}` option to the `podman ps` command now shows the number of times a container has been restarted based on its restart policy.\r\n- The `--format={{.Restarts}}` option to the `podman pod ps` command now shows the total number of container restarts in a pod.\r\n- The podman machine provider can now be specified via the `CONTAINERS_MACHINE_PROVIDER` environment variable, as well as via the `provider` field in `containers.conf` ([#17116](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17116)).\r\n- A default list of pasta arguments can now be set in `containers.conf` via `pasta_options`.\r\n- The `podman machine init` and `podman machine set` commands now support a new option, `--user-mode-networking`, which improves interops with VPN configs that drop traffic from WSL networking, on Windows.\r\n- The remote Podman client\u2019s `podman push` command now supports the `--digestfile` option ([#18216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18216)).\r\n- Podman now supports a new option, `--out`, that allows redirection or suppression of STDOUT ([#18120](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18120)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The `podman system service` command now emits a warning when binding to a TCP socket. This is not a secure configuration and the Podman team recommends against using it.\r\n- The `podman top` command no longer depends on ps(1) being present in the container image and now uses the one from the host ([#19001](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19001)).\r\n- The `--filter id=xxx` option will now treat `xxx` as a CID prefix, and not as a regular expression ([#18471](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18471)).\r\n- The `--filter` option now requires multiple `--filter` flags to specify multiple filters. It will no longer support the comma syntax (`--filter label=a,label=b`).\r\n- The `slirp4netns` binary for will now be searched for in paths specified by the `helper_binaries_dir` option in `containers.conf` ([#18239](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18568)).\r\n- Podman machine now updates `/run/docker.sock` within the guest to be consistent with its rootless/rootful setting ([#18480](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18480)).\r\n- The `podman system df` command now counts files which podman generates for use with specific containers as part of the disk space used by those containers, and which can be reclaimed by removing those containers. It also counts space used by files it associates with specific images and volumes as being used by those images and volumes.\r\n- The `podman build` command now returns a clearer error message when the Containerfile cannot be found. ([#16354](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16354)).\r\n- Containers created with `--pid=host` will no longer print errors on podman stop ([#18460](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18460)).\r\n- The `podman manifest push` command no longer requires a destination to be specified. If a destination is not provided, the source is used as the destination ([#18360](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18360)).\r\n- The `podman system reset` command now warns the user that the graphroot and runroot directories will be deleted ([#18349](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18349)), ([#18295](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18295)).\r\n- The `package` and `package-install` targets in Makefile have now been fixed and also renamed to `rpm` and `rpm-install` respectively for clarity ([#18817](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18817)).\r\n\r\n### Quadlet\r\n- Quadlet now exits with a non-zero exit code when errors are found ([#18778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18778)).\r\n- Rootless podman quadlet files can now be installed in `/etc/containers/systemd/users` directory.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `AutoUpdate` option.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Mask` and `Unmask` options.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `WorkingDir` option, which specifies the default working dir in a container.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Sysctl` option, which sets namespaced kernel parameters for containers ([#18727](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18727)).\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `SecurityLabelNetsted=true` option, which allows nested SELinux containers.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Pull` option in `.container` files ([#18779](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18779)).\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `ExitCode` field in `.kube` files, which reflects the exit codes of failed containers.\r\n- Quadlet now supports `PodmanArgs` field.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `HostName` field, which sets the container's host name, in `.container` files ([#18486](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18486)).\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command would fail with a 255 exit code. It now waits for systemd-user sessions to be up, and for SSH to be ready, addressing the flaky machine starts ([#17403](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17403)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman auto update` command did not correctly use authentication files when contacting container registries.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `--label` option to the `podman volume ls` command would return volumes that matched any of the filters, not all of them  ([#19219](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19219)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command did not recognize containerPort names inside Kubernetes liveness probes. Now, liveness probes support both containerPort names as well as port numbers ([#18645](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18645)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--dns` option to the `podman run` command was ignored for macvlan networks ([#19169](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19169)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman system service` command where setting LISTEN_FDS when listening on TCP would misbehave.\r\n- Fixed a bug where hostnames were not recognized as a network alias. Containers can now resolve other hostnames, in addition to their names ([#17370](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17370)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pod run` command would error after a reboot on a non-systemd system ([#19175](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19175)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--syslog` option returned a fatal error when no syslog server was found ([#19075](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19075)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--mount` option would parse the `readonly` option incorrectly ([#18995](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18995)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where hook executables invoked by the `podman run` command set an incorrect working directory. It now sets the correct working directory pointing to the container bundle directory ([#18907](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18907)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `-device-cgroup-rule` option was silently ignored in rootless mode ([#18698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18698)).\r\n- Listing images is now more resilient towards concurrently running image removals.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--force` option to the `podman kube down` command would not remove volumes ([#18797](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18797)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where setting the `--list-tags` option in the `podman search` command would cause the command to ignore the `--format` option ([#18939](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18939)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command did not properly translate the proxy IP.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman auto-update` command would not restart dependent units (specified via `Requires=`) on auto update ([#18926](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18926)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pull` command would print ids multiple times when using additional stores ([#18647](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18647)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where creating a container while setting unmask option to an empty array would cause the create to fail ([#18848](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18848)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the propagation of proxy settings for QEMU VMs was broken.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman rm -fa` command could fail to remove dependency containers such as pod infra containers ([#18180](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18180)).\r\n- Fixed a bug  where ` --tz` option to the `podman create ` and `podman run` commands would not create a proper localtime symlink to the zoneinfo file, which was causing some applications (e.g. java) to not read the timezone correctly.\r\n- Fixed a bug where lowering the ulimit after container creation would cause the container to fail ([#18714](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18714)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where signals were not forwarded correctly in rootless containers ([#16091](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16091)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter volume=` option to the `podman events` command would not display the relevant events ([#18618](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18618)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman wait` command where containers created with the `--restart=always` option would result in the container staying in a stopped state.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command returned an incorrect memory limit after a `container update`. ([#18621](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18621)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman run` command where the `PODMAN_USERNS` environment variable was not ignored when the `--pod` option was set, resulting in a container created in a different user namespace than its pod ([#18580](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18580)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` command would not create the `/run/.containerenv` when the tmpfs is mounted on `/run` ([#18531](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18531)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `$HOME` environment variable would be configured inconsistently between container starts if a new passwd entry had to be created for the container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would restart initContainers based on the restart policy of the pod. initContainers should never be restarted.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client\u2019s `build` command where an invalid platform would be set.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman history` command did not display tags ([#17763](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17763)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init` command would create invalid machines when run with certain UIDs ([#17893](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17893)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client\u2019s `podman manifest push` command where an error encountered during the push incorrectly claimed that the error occurred while adding an item to the list.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine rm` command would remove the machine connection before the user confirms the removal of the machine ([#18330](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18330)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the sqlite database backend where the first read access may fail ([#17859](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17859)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a podman machine could get stuck in the `starting` state ([#16945](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16945)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where running a container with the `--network=container:` option would fail when the target container uses the host network mode. The same also now works for the other namespace options (`--pid`, `--uts`, `--cgroupns`, `--ipc`) ([#18027](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18027)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format {{.State}}` option to the `podman ps` command would display the status rather than the state ([#18244](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18244)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman commit` command where setting a `--message` while also specifying `--format=docker` options would incorrectly warn that setting a message is incompatible with OCI image formats ([#17773](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17773)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `--format` option to the `podman history` command, where the `{{.CreatedAt}}` and `{{.Size}}` fields were inconsistent with Docker\u2019s output ([#17767](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17767)), ([#17768](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17768)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client where filtering containers would not return all matching containers ([#18153](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18153)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat and Libpod Top endpoints for Containers did not correctly report errors.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Pull and Compat Push endpoints where errors were incorrectly handled.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Wait endpoint to correctly handle the \"removed\" condition ([#18889](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18889)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Stats endpoint for Containers where the `online_cpus` field was not set correctly ([#15754](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15754)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Build endpoint where the pull field accepted a boolean value instead of a string ([#17778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17778)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat History endpoint for Images did not prefix the image ID with `sha256:` ([#17762](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17762)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Libpod Export endpoint for Images where exporting to an oci-dir or a docker-dir format would not export to the correct format ([#15897](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15897)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Containers now supports the `platform` parameter ([#18951](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18951)).\r\n- The Compat Remove endpoint for Images now supports the `noprune` query parameter, which ensures that dangling parents of the specified image are not removed\r\n- The Compat Info endpoint now reports running rootless and SELinux enabled as security options.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Auth endpoint where a nil dereference could potentially occur.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The `podman system service` command is now supported on FreeBSD.\r\n- Updated the Mac pkginstaller QEMU to v8.0.0\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.31.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.48.0\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.26.1\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.55.2", "created_at": "2023-07-20T22:04:23Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.31.1", "tag_name": "v1.31.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.31.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

Plugin releases occur on\n     a regular basis to address issues and feature requests.\n     Please note that in an upcoming version of Packer, we will remove the last\n     bundled plugins from Packer.\n     Users are encouraged to use `packer init` for HCL2 templates or\n     `packer plugins install` with legacy JSON templates for installing external\n     plugins.\n\n* Packer will now warn when using bundled plugins. This feature will be removed in\n    a future version of the tool, so this warning is meant to bring awareness of the\n    upcoming change, and to help users update their environment/templates to be\n    ready for this.\n    [GH-12495](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12495)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n\n* Fixed a bug with how Packer was discovering plugins: in order to load\n     plugins, Packer would recursively scan all the known directories in which\n     we could have installed plugins. This caused unnecessary directory\n     walks and slowdowns upon invocation. Packer will now only check\n     for nested plugins within the directories used by commands such as `packer\n     init`, or `packer plugins install`, or as defined in PACKER_PLUGIN_PATH.\n     Refer to\n     [Packer's plugin directory documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/configure#packer-s-plugin-directory)\n     for details on how loading works.\n     [GH-12414](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12414)\n\n* The `packer init` subcommand now bundles all the missing installed plugins into one\n    condensed warning, as opposed to one warning per missing plugin.\n    [GH-12506](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12506)\n\n### PLUGINS:\n\n* packer-plugin-parallels: The Parallels plugin has been handed over to the Parallels\n     team.

"repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kops", "body": "## Significant changes\r\n\r\n* **The default image has been updated to [Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#ubuntu-2204-jammy/)**.\r\n\r\n* The default retention duration for the etcd backups is now set to 90 days.\r\nThis behaviour can be overridden by setting `spec.etcdClusters[*].manager.backupRetentionDays` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* external-dns is now supported in IPv6 clusters.\r\n\r\n* Using [swap memory](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha/) is now possible by setting `spec.kubelet.memorySwapBehavior`.\r\n\r\n### AWS\r\n\r\n* As of Kubernetes version 1.27, all nodes will default to running with instance-metadata-service tokens required, with a max hop limit of 1.\r\nNewly created clusters will be configured as necessary to have these settings.\r\n\r\n* As of Kubernetes version 1.27, credentials for private ECR repositories will be handled by the out-of-tree credential provider. This is an additional binary that each instance downloads from the assets repository.\r\n\r\n* `Karpenter` has been upgraded to version `0.28.1` and the feature flag is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n### GCP\r\n\r\n* Improved support for private topology.\r\n\r\n* Support for bastions has been added.\r\n\r\n### Openstack\r\n\r\n* Nodes will now assign floating IPs when they are in a subnet that is of type `Public`. Previously\r\nthey would do so when the respective `topology` was set to `public`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.21 has been removed.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.22 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.28.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.23 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.29.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.28.\r\n\r\n* Support for AWS Classic Load Balancer for API is deprecated and should not be used for newly created clusters.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n## Help Wanted\r\n\r\n* kOps needs maintainers for Canal, Flannel, and Kube-Router to keep versions up to date and move the integration from experimental to stable. If no volunteers step up by the time kOps 1.27 is released, support will be phased out.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Automated cherry pick of #14893: Don't expose v1alpha3 API by @johngmyers in

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\nUsers upgrading from 3.11.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.12.x on Erlang 26\r\n(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult\r\nthe [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) first.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.12.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Free disk space monitor on Windows is now more selective in what errors are\r\n   logged.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8837](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8837)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Queue recovery on node restart in certain conditions could run into an exception\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8746](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/8746)\r\n\r\n * `file_handle_cache` operations are now safer when handling non-existent keys.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8784](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/8784)\r\n\r\n * Fixed a potential resource leak in at-least-once dead lettering from quorum queues.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8799](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8799)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * A new command, `rabbitmqctl deactivate_free_disk_space_monitoring`, can be used to (temporarily or permanently) disable\r\n   free disk space monitoring on a node.\r\n\r\n   To re-activate it, use `rabbitmqctl activate_free_disk_space_monitoring`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8801](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8801)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AMQP 1.0 Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 clients that try to publish in a way that results in the message not being routed\r\n   anywhere are now notified with a more sensible settlement status.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#7823](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/7823)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Prometheus scraping API endpoints now support optional authentication.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge (AWS).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8661](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8661)\r\n\r\n * The plugin now filters out values that are `undefined` or `NaN`, simply excluding\r\n   them from the API endpoint response.\r\n\r\n   Previously, if a metric was not computed for any reason (e.g. free disk space monitor\r\n   was disabled on the node), its value could end up being rendered as `undefined` or `NaN`,\r\n   two values that Prometheus scrapers cannot handle (for numerical types such as gauges).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8740](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/8740)\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * It was not possible to close a table column selection pane on\r\n   screens that had little vertical space.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @Antsthebul.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8701](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8701)\r\n\r\n\r\n### STOMP Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n *  This is a **potentially breaking change**.\r\n\r\n    The plugin will now enforce maximum STOMP frame size. Frames larger than that\r\n    size will be rejected. The default maximum size is 4 MiB. It can be increased or decreased:\r\n    ``` ini\r\n    # increase maximum supported STOMP frame size to 10 MiB\r\n    stomp.max_frame_size = 10485760\r\n    ```\r\n    To reduce it from the default 4 MiB to 2 MiB:\r\n    ``` ini\r\n    # 2 MiB\r\n    stomp.max_frame_size = 2097152\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#8802](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8802)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Shovel will gracefully stop when its destination (target) does not exist.\r\n   Such shovels will then be periodically restarted to retry.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @markus812498 (CloudAMQP).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8697](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8697)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web MQTT Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhacements\r\n\r\n * It is now possible to opt in to deactivate file handle cache use in the plugin:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   web_mqtt.use_file_handle_cache = false\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8790](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8790)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web STOMP Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhacements\r\n\r\n * It is now possible to opt in to deactivate file handle cache use in the plugin:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   web_stomp.use_file_handle_cache = false\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#8790](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8790)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * `ra` was upgraded to [`2.6.3`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.12.2.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2023-07-17T04:37:35Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.13.1", "tag_name": "v0.13.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/releases/tag/v0.13.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary", "body": "## 0.13.1 (2023/07/10)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* roles: In grants, the `id` field has been changed to `ids` (but `id` will\n  still be accepted for now, up until 0.15.0).

See [#41113](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41113) for more details. See the upstream Kubernetes [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Docker 23.0 Support\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\nSupport for Docker 23.0 has been added. See [#40731](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40731) for more details. See the upstream Docker [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/23.0/) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Improved Install Process for Kubernetes v1.25 and Above\r\n\r\nRancher versions 2.7.2 through 2.7.4 require users to set `global.cattle.psp.enabled` to `false` to install on Kubernetes versions 1.25 and above. Rancher will now attempt to detect if a cluster is running a Kubernetes version where PSPs are not supported, and default usage of PSPs to `false` if it can determine that PSPs are not supported in the cluster. Users can still manually override this by explicitly providing `true` or `false` for this value. Rancher will still use PSPs by default in clusters which support PSPs, such as clusters running Kubernetes versions 1.24 or lower.\r\n\r\nIf you install Rancher with PSPs enabled on a cluster which doesn't support PSPs, such as by overriding this value to `true` when installing the chart, you may experience issues when attempting to uninstall Rancher, which can leave resources behind. In these cases, you should run the [Rancher cleanup tool](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cleanup) to remove any left-over artifacts of Rancher, and complete the uninstall process. See [#41455](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41455) for more details.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n<!-- team/mapps -->\r\n- Increased the refresh time to 6 hours when updating the Rancher charts Helm repository. This mitigates timeout errors on git.rancher.io during Rancher releases. See [#40805](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40805).\r\n- You can now select Okta groups from the **Member Roles** dropdown under **Cluster Settings**. See [#38029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38029) for more details.\r\n- Added customization support for scheduling fields and resource limits for the cluster agent, and for the cluster's Fleet agent. You can use this feature to modify cluster tolerations, affinity rules, and resource requirments. See [#41035](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41035) and the [Rancher documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-server-configuration) (under *Cluster Agent Configuration and Fleet Agent Configuration* for your respective Kubernetes distribution).\r\n\r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- The Advanced Worker now supports the `management` and `rancher` stores, and  handles socket management and event processing within a Web Worker . See [#8837](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8837).\r\n- You can view a list of resources for projects with a single request by filtering by one or more projects or namespaces. See [#7618](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7618).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Disabled a feature that caused a significant memory increase in both Rancher and downstream clusters. See [#41379](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41379).\r\n<!-- team/area2, area/harvester, area/provisioning-v2 -->\r\n- Fixed an issue where, during an upgrade of RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the first node would be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling was disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n<!-- team/area1, area/ingress, area/server-chart -->\r\n- Added the `--set service.type: NodePort` Helm setting. This resolves an issue where clusters that used the default GKE ingress but didn't use VPC-native mode were incompatible with `cattle-system/rancher`. See [#16061](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16061).\r\n- Fixed an issue where, when removing finalizers from a provisioning cluster object, there was a race condition between adding the finalizers back and the generating framework that deletes the generated `rkecluster`, `rkecontrolplane`, `cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io` and `machinedeployment`s. See [#41887](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41887).\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\n- The `v1.24.14+k3s1`, `v1.25.10+k3s1`, and `v1.26.5+k3s1` K3s versions added in Rancher v2.7.5 fix an issue where Ingress wasn't working on certain K3s clusters following an upgrade. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/7586#issuecomment-1555414626) for earlier Kubernetes versions. See [#41582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41582). \r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Rancher now installs the same pinned version of the rancher-webhook chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Note that restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions ideally need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n- The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n- After upgrading to Rancher v2.7.5, LDAP-based login using Active Directory integration fails due a change in the LDAP search scope. See [#42122](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42122).\r\n- After upgrading to Rancher v2.7.5, a migration is performed due to the LDAP search scope update. During the migration, logging in with a user that hasn't been migrated yet will create a duplicate user. The initial login succeeds, but the user won't have the expected permissions and subsequent logins will fail due to duplicates of the user existing. See [#42120](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42120).\r\n- When you try to upgrade an RKE1 v1.22 cluster on Rancher v2.7.2 or above, the upgrade fails with a \"failure to validate\" cluster error. See [#42127](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42127).\r\n- When you try to provision an RKE2 node with a custom Docker machine driver and already have multiple Rancher replicas running, the provisioning job will fail, as it can not find the driver in `/assets`. See [#42128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42128).\r\n- Attempting to delete a master node breaks the ectd configuration on the former master node. Endpoints won't update correctly and the leader election process will fail. This breaks the Cluster API. See [#42121](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42121).\r\n- Fleet periodically deletes certain Kubernetes resources in bundles. Bundle IDs are trimmed to fit within the Helm release name length (53 chars) using the `<trimmed-release-name>-<6-char-hash>` format. When the 47th character of the original release name is already a dash (`-`), the generated release name will contain a double dash. This leads to discrepancies between the actual deployed release name, and the one expected by Fleet to be deployed. Fleet deletes and redeploys the corresponding bundle. See [#1660](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1660).\t\r\n- The relationship between a given Rancher version and a given Fleet version is currently not defined, which may lead to inconsistent versions of Fleet being installed during  Rancher upgrades. See [#1590](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1590).\r\n- Fleet is creating a large number of orphaned resources, which are then stored in etcd. This increased load on etcd is leading to timeouts. See [#1656](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1656).\r\n- During an RKE2 snapshot restore of a custom cluster, Rancher might delete nodes from the cluster. <!-- SURE-6669 -->\r\n- When you edit RKE1 clusters with defined Cluster agent or Fleet agent configurations, removing these values and adding new ones to the same section results in the new values not being saved. Editing the cluster and setting the new values again will correctly apply the change. See [#9003](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9003).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n<!-- team/rke2 -->\r\n- When you upgrade a Windows RKE2 cluster, the upgrade gets stuck on the Windows node and is unable to complete. Some logs indicate that RKE2 is unable to restart because the process is currently being used. See [#41868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41868).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter (such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later), upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0, which supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command, to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the privileged flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n- The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s now respects the `managedBy` annotation. Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround in its initial release to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false` since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n- Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n- Privilege escalation is now disabled by default when creating deployments. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n- Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n  - Rancher now aggregates the changed counts and only send a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n  - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, causing significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n- When provisioning downstream clusters, the cluster name must now conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n- In previous versions, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging, instead of Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some  necessary actions within Azure AD. This will cause errors.\r\n- Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters. The default behavior has been changed, so that if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.5\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.6](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.6)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.26.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.9\r\n- v1.24.13\r\n- v1.23.16\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.26.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.10\r\n- v1.24.14\r\n- v1.23.17\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Major Issues\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.7.2, a webhook will now be installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher >= v2.7.2 to a version < v2.7.2, you'll experience an issue where the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after Rancher version < v2.7.2 is running) to remove the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE and RKE2:**\r\n    - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n    - The `fleet-agent` pod fails to deploy on an upgraded RKE2 Windows Custom cluster. See [#993](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/993).\r\n  - **RKE2 and K3s:**\r\n    - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).\r\n    - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n        - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n        - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - Clusters are in an `Updating` state even when it contains nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020029) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n    - If you have downstream private GKE clusters, you might experience issues when interacting with the resources that the webhook validates, such as namespaces. This can cause problems with activities where Rancher needs to interact with those resources, such as when you install charts. As a [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142#issuecomment-1505624756), add a firewall setting to allow traffic to the webhook. See [#41142](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Authentication:**\r\n    - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after configuring another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup annotation with the unlocked value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. During an upgrade, this is a benign error and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - - When enabling some custom node drivers, the Cloud Credential creation page does not show the correct default fields and has an uneditable foo key. See [#8563](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8563).\r\n  - You need to force-refresh the Rancher UI after initial Rancher setup, to trigger the prompt to accept the self-signed certificate. As a workaround, visit the Rancher portal, accept the self-signed certificate, and go through the setup process. Once done, go to the address bar of your browser and click the lock icon. Select the option to allow you to receive certificate errors for the Rancher website. You'll then be prompted again to accept the new certificate. See [#7867](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7867).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n  - Remove legacy feature multi-cluster app. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n", "created_at": "2023-06-29T02:19:26Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.6.1", "tag_name": "v2.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.6.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "This release introduces several bug fixes for Chaos Mesh.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n* Set replicas: 1 automatically when HA is not enabled https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/4079\r\n* Fix dashboard panic when exec delete action by finish_time https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/4100", "created_at": "2023-06-28T07:50:08Z", "project": "Chaos Mesh", "repo": "chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "type": "Chaos", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v3.1.2", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openvswitch/ovs/commits/91677744752e67b147aa9ac6b0bef528bb4a1afe", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs", "body": "Set release date for 3.1.2.\n\nAcked-by: Eelco Chaudron <echaudro@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Maximets <i.maximets@ovn.org>", "created_at": "2023-06-27T14:30:44Z", "project": "Ovs", "repo": "openvswitch/ovs", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "REL_16_BETA2", "html_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/19508f4763b6e55baae788af000ee47e74d24370", "repo_url": "https://github.com/postgres/postgres", "body": "Stamp 16beta2.", "created_at": "2023-06-26T20:07:19Z", "project": "Postgres", "repo": "postgres/postgres", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.16.0", "tag_name": "v1.16.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/releases/tag/v1.16.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/consul", "body": "## 1.16.0 (June 26, 2023)\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGES:\r\n\r\n* api: The `/v1/health/connect/` and `/v1/health/ingress/` endpoints now immediately return 403 \"Permission Denied\" errors whenever a token with insufficient `service:read` permissions is provided.

However, this was not done when\na view reference was replaced with a new field. This made the field\nreferenced to be deleted when it was wrongly concluded that the field is\nunused. Problem arises because the same underlying field is referenced by\nall the view references created for that field.\n\nFor a query like this one:\nWITH  cte AS (SELECT\n              (SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1),\n               COUNT(dt.f2),\n               dt.f3\n              FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS dt)\nSELECT * FROM cte;\n\nit gets transformed into\n\nselect `derived_2_6`.`COUNT(f1)` AS `(SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`COUNT(dt.f2)` AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`Name_exp_1` AS `f3`\nfrom (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f2`) AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n            `test`.`t1`.`f3` AS `Name_exp_1`\n      from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_5`\nleft join (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f1`) AS `COUNT(f1)`\n           from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_6` on(true) where true;\n\nThe expression \"Name_exp_1\" is a view reference because the derived\ntable \"dt\" gets merged. When this is replaced with an \"Item_field\"\nduring subquery to derived transformation, we do not increment the\nreference count. Later, we see that the derived table \"cte\" which\nis resolved after the creation of the derived tables \"derived_2_5\"\nand \"derived_2_6\" gets merged. While deleting the un-used fields for\nthis derived table, we delete the field \"f3\" even though it is still\nused in the query.\n\nFix is to correctly increment the ref count for the new field created.\n\nChange-Id: I4035d86990e3cfb099144b7f304b864eb0451f5d", "created_at": "2023-06-22T07:34:44Z", "project": "Mysql", "repo": "mysql/mysql-server", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.21.4.2", "tag_name": "v1.21.4.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/openresty/openresty/releases/tag/v1.21.4.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openresty/openresty", "body": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21T13:19:59Z", "project": "Openresty", "repo": "openresty/openresty", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.0.1 Release", "tag_name": "v2.0.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/releases/tag/v2.0.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Netflix/eureka", "body": "Bug fixes", "created_at": "2023-06-19T17:11:19Z", "project": "Eureka", "repo": "Netflix/eureka", "type": "Discovery", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.3.7", "tag_name": "v2.3.7", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/releases/tag/v2.3.7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant", "body": "CHANGELOG:\n\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/v2.3.7/CHANGELOG.md", "created_at": "2023-06-15T20:40:35Z", "project": "Vagrant", "repo": "hashicorp/vagrant", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.20.0", "tag_name": "v0.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind", "body": "KIND v0.20.0 fixes runc 1.1.6+ / misc controller support as well as cgroupns support on cgroup v1 and begins the migration to private cgroupns for all kind nodes.\r\n\r\nIn a future release kind node images will drop support for kind binaries without cgroupns=private (which is already the default on all cgroup v2 hosts, and cgroup v1 in kind v0.20.0).

tool.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Distributed Deployment Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide).\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade from v2.0.1 to v2.1.0\r\n* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/master/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB\r\n* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:\r\n  * apollo-configservice\r\n  * apollo-adminservice\r\n  * apollo-portal\r\n* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204\r\n```sql\r\nuse ApolloPortalDB;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION`;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @shenhuaxin made their first contribution in https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/4409\r\n* @lorgine-li made their first
