See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/907\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add support for `proxy_url` config option in Prometheus scrape configs. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/503\r\n* FEATURE: remove parts with stale data as soon as they go outside the configured `-retentionPeriod`. Previously such parts may remain active for long periods of time. This should help reducing disk usage for `-retentionPeriod` smaller than one month.\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: allow setting multiple values for `-notifier.tlsInsecureSkipVerify` command-line flag per each `-notifier.url`.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: vmalert: properly escape multiline queries when passing them to Grafana. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/890\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: set missing `__meta_kubernetes_service_*` labels in `kubernetes_sd_config` for `endpoints` and `endpointslices` roles. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/982\r\n* BUGFIX: do not adjust `offset` value provided in MetricsQL query. Previously it could be modified in order to improve response cache hit ratio. This is unneeded, since cache hit ratio should remain good because the query time range should be already aligned to multiple of `step` values.

Native RWX support (experimental)\r\n    1. See [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/) for documentation.\r\n1. ARM64 support (experimental)\r\n    1. Longhorn now supports ARM64 architecture in addition to AMD64. You can deploy Longhorn as usual in ARM64 without any modification.\r\n1. [CSI Snapshotter support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/)\r\n    1. CSI Snapshotter is a new beta feature since Kubernetes v1.17. It allows users to create snapshots for volumes directly using the `kubectl` command. In Longhorn's context, those `CSI snapshots` will be mapped into `backups`. So after we add the support, Longhorn users will be able to create/restore backups for the volumes without using the Longhorn UI.\r\n1. [Prometheus support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/monitoring/)\r\n    1. We've added Prometheus endpoints and an example Grafana dashboard.\r\n    1. Now the users can easily use the existing monitoring solution to collect stats about the Longhorn, as well as set up alerts for certain situations.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n1. Enhanced failure recovery during Kubernetes node failure\r\n    1. [Automatic recovery for the StatefulSets](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/node-failure/#pod-deletion-policy-when-node-is-down).\r\n    1. [Improved recovery mechanism for volume failure](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/recover-volume/).\r\n    1. Rebuild based on existing replica after the node temporarily disconnected.\r\n1. [Better node maintenance support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/volumes-and-nodes/maintenance/)\r\n    1. Automatically remove node when the node has been removed from Kubernetes.\r\n    1. Automatically recognized the existing disk on another node (e.g. reattached EBS on a different EC2 instance).\r\n    1. Support Kubernetes `drain`.\r\n    1. Support manually pause replica rebuild for server maintenance.\r\n    1. Support replica eviction for the nodes/disks.\r\n1. Support [`Data Locality` option](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/data-locality/) to always keep a replica local to the engine.\r\n    1. The data locality feature will always try to keep a replica local to the workload, which guarantees even when the network interruption happens, the volume will continue working for the local workload.\r\n1. [Allow volume creation with degraded availability](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/references/settings/#allow-volume-creation-with-degraded-availability)\r\n    1. If the value is **true**, Longhorn will not prevent the volume creation as long as there is at least one replica has been scheduled successfully. It will help users with less than 3 nodes environment. Longhorn will automatically start rebuilding replicas if more available space on other nodes is found later.\r\n    1. The default value is **true**. Recommend value for **the production environment: false**.\r\n1. Improvement performance via removing revision counter (experimental).\r\n\r\n# Release note\r\n1. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn v1.1.0 is **v1.16**.\r\n2. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn with CSI Snapshotter is **v1.17**.\r\n    1. Please follow the instruction [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/) to install the CSI Snapshot Controller in your Kubernetes cluster if you want to use the CSI snapshot feature. \r\n1. Experimental features:\r\n    1. For the experimental features in this release, we will continue working on improving them. We don't recommend using the experimental features in production.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade\r\nLive upgrade from v1.0.x is supported. Follow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/deploy/upgrade/)", "created_at": "2020-12-18T03:33:45Z", "project": "Longhorn", "repo": "longhorn/longhorn", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.3.0", "tag_name": "v1.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v1.3.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk", "body": "This is a big release, namely that a new go [CLI plugin](https://master.book.kubebuilder.io/reference/cli-plugins.html) `go/v3` has been introduced and is now the default when `operator-sdk init` is run. All projects initialized with previous operator-sdk versions (which use `go/v2`) are still and will continue to be supported until v2.0.0. Some of the biggest updates that come with this new plugin:\r\n- Kubernetes v1.19 support\r\n- v1 CRD and webhook configuration support by default (v1beta1 is still supported)\r\n- Liveness and readiness probes by default\r\n- An option to use controller-runtime's [component config](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/config) to configure your operator\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the new [`run bundle-upgrade`](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/cli/operator-sdk_run_bundle-upgrade/) lets you test bundled operator upgrades in-cluster and is available to all project types. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Additions\r\n\r\n- Added OLM bindata for the 0.17.0 release version. ([#4242](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4242))\r\n- Added [`order=<int>`](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/markers/#usage) marker fields to CSV markers. ([#4254](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4254))\r\n- In Ansible-based operators, added the `ansible_operator_build_info` metric to instrument commit and version information. ([#4220](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4220))\r\n- In Helm-based operators, added the `helm_operator_build_info` metric to instrument commit and version information. ([#4220](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4220))\r\n- Added the `--package <name>` flag to all `generate` subcommands. This flag is required by `generate <bundle|packagemanifests>` when run outside of a project. ([#4074](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4074))\r\n- Added the `run bundle-upgrade` subcommand to automate testing upgrades of an operator from one version to another using OLM. ([#4271](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4271))\r\n- (go/v2) Added the command `\u00f2perator-sdk edit` which allows users edit the project layout to support [multi-group](https://book.kubebuilder.io/migration/multi-group.html). ([#4156](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4156))\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- (go/v2) Bumped controller-runtime from v0.6.3 to v0.6.4. ([#4282](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4282))\r\n- Go CLI plugin go/v3 is now the default. ([#4307](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4307))\r\n- Bumped `operator-sdk` binary dependencies to their k8s v1.19 equivalents. ([#4294](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4294))\r\n- Updated helm-operator's Helm dependency to v3.4.1. ([#4259](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4259))\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Made the `cleanup` command's error handling more robust on deletion and \"not found\" events. ([#4303](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4303))\r\n- Fixed the documented `packagemanifests` make recipe. ([#4303](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4303))\r\n- `generate kustomize manifests` will now (re)generate a base `ClusterServiceVersion` manifest with a valid name. ([#4276](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4276))\r\n- (ansible/v1) Pinned all top level Python requirements. This fixes a bug that erroneously installed Ansible 2.10.z instead of Ansible 2.9.z. ([#4321](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4321))\r\n- Refactored the `generate bundle|packagemanifest` commands to generate bundles/package manifest data outside of projects. ([#4074](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4074))\r\n- (go/v2) Removed unused import for defaulting webhooks scaffolded by `create webhook` ([kubebuilder#1718](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/1718)). ([#4156](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4156))\r\n- (go/v2) Allow owner to not be specified in generated licenses ([kubebuilder#1749](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/1749)). ([#4156](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4156))\r\n- (go/v2) Fixed controller imports scaffolded by `create api` when `--resource=false` ([kubebuilder#1770](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/1770)).

([#27212](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27212))\n\n    Only primitive-typed values have a string representation, so this formatting mode is not compatible with complex types. The `-json` mode is still available as a general way to get a machine-readable representation of an output value of any type.\n    \n* config: `for_each` now allows maps whose _element values_ are sensitive, as long as the element keys and the map itself are not sensitive. ([#27247](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27247))\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* config: Fix `anytrue` and `alltrue` functions when called with values which are not known until apply. ([#27240](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27240))\n* config: Fix `sum` function when called with values which are not known until apply. Also allows `sum` to cope with numbers too large to represent in float64, along with correctly handling errors around infinite values. ([#27249](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27249))\n* config: Fixed panic when referencing sensitive values in resource `count` expressions ([#27238](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27238))\n* config: Fix incorrect attributes in diagnostics when validating objects ([#27010](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27010))\n* core: Prevent unexpected updates during plan when multiple sensitive values are involved ([#27318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27318))\n* dependencies: Fix several small bugs related to the use of `sensitive` values with expressions and functions.\n* lang: Fix panic when calling `coalescelist` with a `null` argument ([#26988](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26988))\n* `terraform apply`: `-refresh=false` was skipped when running apply directly ([#27233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27233))\n* `terraform init`: setting `-get-plugins` to `false` will now cause a warning, as this flag has been a no-op since 0.13.0 and usage is better served through using `provider_installation` blocks ([#27092](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27092))\n* `terraform init` and other commands which interact with the dependency lock file: These will now generate a normal error message if the lock file is incorrectly a directory, rather than crashing as before.

The operator extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of Contour on behalf of users. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts, but includes domain-specific knowledge to automate the entire lifecycle of Contour. \r\n\r\nVisit the [getting started guide](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started/#option-2-install-using-operator) on how to quickly get up and running with the operator.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the [contour operator](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour-operator) repo.\r\n\r\n## Global TLS minimum to 1.2\r\nThe default global minimum TLS version is moved to 1.2 from 1.1.\r\nThis forces all HTTPProxies and Ingresses to use at least 1.2.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3112\r\n\r\n## Envoy v1.16.2\r\n\r\nContour supports Envoy v1.16.2 which resolves various CVEs found in Envoy, please upgrade your clusters!\r\n\r\n## Envoy XDS Resource Version Support\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [Contour 1.10](https://projectcontour.io/contour_v1100/#envoy-xds-v3-support) the `v2` XDS resource version has been removed from Contour ahead of its removal from Envoy. Please see the [XDS Migration Guide](https://projectcontour.io/guides/xds-migration/) for upgrading your instances of Envoy/Contour.\r\n\r\n__Note:__ This change applies also to any External Auth servers that may be integrated.\r\n\r\n## Trigger rebuild for configured secrets\r\n\r\nIf client certificates, represented in Kubernetes secrets, were changes, Contour did not notice that change and blocked a valid cert rotation path for users. Contour v1.11 adds secret references from the configuration file to the list of secrets that will trigger DAG rebuild.  Previously only secrets referred by HTTPProxy and Ingress resources were considered.  The result was that secrets were not picked up correctly if they were created after the creation of HTTPProxy or Ingress themselves triggered a rebuild.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3191\r\n\r\nThanks to @tsaarni  for the fix and @Zsolt-LazarZsolt for reporting!\r\n\r\n## Deprecation Notices\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f Contour annotations starting with `contour.heptio.com` have been removed from documentation for some time. Contour 1.8 marks the official deprecation of these annotations and have been removed in Contour v1.11.0.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading\r\nPlease consult the upgrade [documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n## Community Thanks!\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

"https://github.com/openebs/openebs", "body": "## Release Summary\r\n\r\nOpenEBS v2.4 is our last monthly release for the year with some key enhancements and several fixes for the issues reported by the user community. \r\n\r\n_Note: With Kubernetes 1.20, `SelfLink` option has been removed which is used by the OpenEBS jiva and cStor (non-csi) provisioners. This causes the PVCs to remain in a `pending` state. The workaround and fix for this are being tracked under this [issue](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3314). A patch release will be made available as soon as the fix has been verified on 1.20 platforms._ \r\n\r\nHere are some of the key highlights in this release:\r\n\r\n### New capabilities\r\n- ZFS Local PV has now been graduated to stable with all the supported features and upgrade tests automated via e2e testing. ZFS Local PV is best suited for distributed workloads that require resilient local volumes that can sustain local disk failures. You can read more about using the ZFS Local volumes at https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv and check out how ZFS Local PVs are used in production at [Optoro](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/adopters/optoro/README.md).\r\n\r\n- OpenEBS is introducing a new NFS dynamic provisioner to allow the creation and deletion of NFS volumes using Kernel NFS backed by block storage. This provisioner is being actively developed and released as alpha. This new provisioner allows users to provision OpenEBS RWX volumes where each volume gets its own NFS server instance. In the previous releases, OpenEBS RWX volumes were supported via the [Kubernetes NFS Ganesha and External Provisioner](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/rwm.html) - where multiple RWX volumes share the same NFS Ganesha Server. You can read more about the new OpenEBS Dynamic Provisioner at https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Added support for specifying a custom node affinity label for OpenEBS Local Hostpath volumes. By default, OpenEBS Local Hostpath volumes use `kubenetes.io/hostname` for setting the PV Node Affinity. Users can now specify a custom label to use for PV Node Affinity. Custom node affinity can be specified in the Local PV storage class as follows: \r\n  ```\r\n  kind: StorageClass\r\n  metadata:\r\n    name: openebs-hostpath\r\n    annotations:\r\n      openebs.io/cas-type: local\r\n      cas.openebs.io/config: |\r\n        - name: StorageType\r\n          value: \"hostpath\"\r\n        - name: NodeAffinityLabel\r\n          value: \"openebs.io/custom-node-id\"\r\n  provisioner: openebs.io/local\r\n  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\r\n  reclaimPolicy: Delete\r\n  ```\r\n  This will help with use cases like:\r\n  - Deployments where `kubenetes.io/hostname` is not unique across the cluster (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2875)\r\n  - Deployments, where an existing Kubernetes node in the cluster running Local volumes is replaced with a new node, and storage attached to the old node, is moved to a new node. Without this feature, the Pods using the older node will remain in the pending state.  \r\n- Added a configuration option to the Jiva volume provisioner to skip adding replica node affinity. This will help in deployments where replica nodes are frequently replaced with new nodes causing the replica to remain in the pending state. The replica node affinity should be used in cases where replica nodes are not replaced with new nodes or the new node comes back with the same node-affinity label. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3226). The node affinity for jiva volumes can be skipped by specifying the following ENV variable in the OpenEBS Provisioner Deployment. \r\n   ```\r\n        - name: OPENEBS_IO_JIVA_PATCH_NODE_AFFINITY\r\n          value: \"disabled\"\r\n   ```\r\n- Enhanced OpenEBS Velero plugin (cStor) to automatically set the target IP once the cStor volumes is restored from a backup.  (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/pull/131). This feature can be enabled by updating the VolumeSnapshotLocal using `configuration option autoSetTargetIP` as follows:\r\n  ```\r\n  apiVersion: velero.io/v1\r\n  kind: VolumeSnapshotLocation\r\n  metadata:\r\n    ...\r\n  spec:\r\n    config:\r\n      ...\r\n      ...\r\n      autoSetTargetIP: \"true\"\r\n  ```\r\n  (Huge thanks to @zlymeda for working on this feature which involved co-ordinating this fix across multiple repositories).\r\n- Enhanced the OpenEBS Velero plugin used to automatically create the target namespace during restore, if the target namespace doesn't exist. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/issues/137).\r\n- Enhanced the OpenEBS helm chart to support Image pull secrets. https://github.com/openebs/charts/pull/174\r\n- Enhance OpenEBS helm chart to allow specifying resource limits on OpenEBS control plane pods. https://github.com/openebs/charts/issues/151\r\n- Enhanced the NDM filters to support discovering LVM devices both with `/dev/dm-X` and `/dev/mapper/x` patterns. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3310).\r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue that was causing Jiva Target to crash due to fetching stats while there was an ongoing IO. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/jiva/pull/334). \r\n- Fixed an issue where Jiva volumes failed to start if PodSecurityPolicies were setup. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3305). \r\n- Fixed an issue where helm chart `--dry-run` would fail due to admission webhook checks. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/maya/issues/1771). \r\n- Fixed an issue where NDM would fail to discover block devices on encountering an issue with block device, even if there were other good devices on the node. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3051).\r\n- Fixed an issue where NDM failed to detect OS disk on `cos` nodes, where the root partition entry was set as `root=/dev/dm-0`. (Ref: https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager/pull/516). \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Velero has updated the configuration for specifying a different node selector during restore. The configuration changes from `velero.io/change-pvc-node` to `velero.io/change-pvc-node-selector`. ( Ref: https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin/pull/139)\r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n- OpenEBS ZFS Local PV CI has been updated to include CSI Sanity tests and fixed some minor issue to confirm with CSI test suite. ( Ref: https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/pull/232).\r\n- OpenEBS has applied for becoming a CNCF incubation project and is currently undergoing a Storage SIG review of the project and addressing the review comment provided. \r\n- Significant work is underway to make it easier to install only the components that the users finally decide to use for their workloads. These features will allow users to run different flavors of OpenEBS in K8s clusters optimized for the workloads they intend to run in the cluster. This can be achieved in the current version using a customized helm values file or using a modified Kubernetes manifest file. We have continued to make some significant progress with the help of the community towards supporting individual helm charts for each of the storage engines. The location for the various helm charts are as follows:\r\n    - Dynamic Local PV ( host path and device) \r\n    - Dynamic Local PV CSI ( ZFS )\r\n    - Dynamic Local PV CSI ( Rawfile ) \r\n    - cStor\r\n    - Mayastor\r\n- Automation of further Day 2 operations like -  automatically detecting a node deletion from the cluster, and re-balancing the volume replicas onto the next available node. \r\n- Keeping the OpenEBS generated Kubernetes custom resources in sync with the upstream Kubernetes versions, like moving CRDs from `v1beta1` to `v1`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @FeynmanZhou (KubeSphere) for becoming a public reference and supporter of OpenEBS by sharing your use case on [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS? You can help OpenEBS in its journey towards becoming CNCF Incubation project by sharing your OpenEBS story and join the league of [OpenEBS Adopters](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2719).\r\n\r\n### Shout outs!\r\n\r\n_MANY THANKS_ to our existing contributors and for everyone helping OpenEBS Community going. \r\n\r\nA very special thanks to our  **first-time** contributors to code, tests, and docs:  @alexppg, @arne-rusek, @Atharex, @bobek, @Mosibi, @mpartel, @nareshdesh, @rahulkrishnanfs, @ssytnikov18, @survivant \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite to install\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.14+ or newer release is installed. \r\n- Kubernetes 1.17+ is recommended for using cStor CSI drivers.\r\n- Make sure that you run the below installation steps with the cluster-admin context. The installation will involve creating a new Service Account and assigning it to OpenEBS components.\r\n- Make sure [iSCSI Initiator](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html) is installed on the Kubernetes nodes.\r\n- Node-Disk-Manager (NDM) helps in discovering the devices attached to Kubernetes nodes, which can be used to create storage pools. If you like to exclude some of the disks from getting discovered, update the filters in [NDM Config Map](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugndm.html) to exclude paths before installing OpenEBS.\r\n- NDM runs as a privileged pod since it needs to access the device information. Please make the necessary changes to grant access to run in privileged mode. For example, when running in RHEL/CentOS, you may need to set the security context appropriately. Refer [Configuring OpenEBS with selinux=on](https://blog.openebs.io/configuring-openebs-to-run-with-security-enhanced-linux-1e5a90a91da2)\r\n\r\n### Install using kubectl\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/2.4.0/openebs-operator.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install using Helm stable charts\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install --namespace openebs --name openebs openebs/openebs --version 2.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details refer to the documentation at https://docs.openebs.io/\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade to 2.4 is supported only from 1.0 or higher and follows a similar process as earlier releases.

If you are using the cStor Storage Engine, please review the following before upgrading to this release.\r\n\r\n- The recommended approach for deploying cStor Pools is using the new custom resource called cStorPoolCluster (CSPC). Even though the provisioning of cStor Pools using StoragePoolClaim(SPC) is supported, it will be deprecated in future releases. The pools provisioned using SPC can be easily migrated to CSPC.  \r\n- When using cStor Pools, make sure that raw block devices are available on the nodes. If the block devices are formatted with a filesystem or mounted, then cStor Pool will not be created on the block device. In the current release, there are [manual steps](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/t-volume-provisioning.html#cstor-pool-pod-not-running) that could be followed to clear the filesystem or use partitions for creating cStor Pools, please reach out to the community (#openebs) at https://slack.k8s.io.\r\n- If you are using cStor pools with ephemeral devices, starting with 1.2 - upon node restart, cStor Pool will not be automatically re-created on the new devices. This check has been put to make sure that nodes are not accidentally restarted with new disks. The steps to recover from such a situation are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/maya/pull/1401#issue-308355304), which involve changing the status of the corresponding CSP to `Init`.\r\n- Capacity over-provisioning is enabled by default on the cStor pools. If you don\u2019t have alerts set up for monitoring the usage of the cStor pools, the pools can be fully utilized and the volumes can get into a read-only state. To avoid this, set up resource quotas as described in https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2855.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-12-15T16:55:11Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "release-1.19.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/nginx/nginx/commit/65ddeebf338b68bc7d1c061a58fa24f988080d2c", "repo_url": "https://github.com/nginx/nginx", "body": "nginx-1.19.6-RELEASE", "created_at": "2020-12-15T14:41:39Z", "project": "Nginx", "repo": "nginx/nginx", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Teleport 4.3.9", "tag_name": "v4.3.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v4.3.9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport", "body": "This release of Teleport contains a security fix.\r\n\r\n* Mitigated [CVE-2020-29509](https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg) by updating `github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2`.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2` library which is used by Teleport for SSO authentication via the SAML protocol.\r\n\r\nWith a carefully crafted SAML response, an attacker could inject malicious content, bypassing signature validation, permitting full authentication bypass.  \r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\nAll Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to the latest release of Teleport.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nDownload the current and previous releases of Teleport at https://gravitational.com/teleport/download.", "created_at": "2020-12-15T02:03:11Z", "project": "Teleport", "repo": "gravitational/teleport", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/commit/fe04d346df55bbfba36682e69fb3bcd790cfbfe8", "repo_url": "https://github.com/influxdata/influxDb", "body": "chore: freeze CHANGELOG for 2.0.3", "created_at": "2020-12-15T00:12:33Z", "project": "InfluxDb", "repo": "influxdata/influxDb", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.10.4", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/commits/436d8a13b48de1115a05a056aac6daa3e979e7f5", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible", "body": "New release v2.10.4", "created_at": "2020-12-14T20:44:44Z", "project": "Ansible", "repo": "ansible/ansible", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "r4.4.3", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo/commits/913d6b62acfbb344dde1b116f4161360acd8fd13", "repo_url": "https://github.com/mongoDb/mongo", "body": "SERVER-53029 Port the changes for SERVER-52955 to later branches", "created_at": "2020-12-14T17:44:03Z", "project": "MongoDb", "repo": "mongoDb/mongo", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.1", "tag_name": "v1.0.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/releases/tag/v1.0.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec", "body": "Significant PRs since v1.0:\r\n\r\n    Add protobuf format as a sub-protocol -

Cutting the first rc for 1.20 - v1.20.0-rc.1 ([#4416](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4416), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))\r\n\r\n#### API Change\r\n - Add allowed_annotations option to runtime handler structure, which allows admins to gate which runtime classes interpret the annotation io.kubernetes.cri-o.userns-mode. In doing so, also drop the experimental allow_userns_annotation option. ([#4281](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4281), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Feature\r\n - Add `io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices` annotation to the list interpretable allowed annotations. Now, users can pass in devices they want added to their containers, but only if the runtime class is allowed to use the annotation. ([#4349](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4349), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Add option `seccomp_override_empty` to override an unspecified seccomp profile from being unconfined to being the runtime default. Note: setting this option makes CRI-O not fully CRI compliant, but does increase security. ([#4212](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4212), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Allow using userns together with ManageNSLifecycle ([#4333](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4333), [@kolyshkin](https://github.com/kolyshkin))\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n - When running under systemd, image pulls happen in a new cgroup ([#4057](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4057), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n - The `manage_ns_lifecycle` option is now deprecated, and will be set to true unconditionally in the future. ([#4209](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4209), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - CRIO allow to run pods with default runtime profile in the Pod.Spec, if seccomp is disabled ([#4370](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4370), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))\r\n - Crio-o portMapping dual-stack support ([#4361](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4361), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))\r\n - Fix a bug where a timeout in RunPodSandbox or CreateContainer requests caused CRI-O to delete the newly created resource. Now, it saves that resource, until the kubelet re-requests it, thus allowing kubelet and CRI-O to reconcile quicker when nodes are under load. ([#4430](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4430), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix bug where runAsUser would only work with runAsGroup if userns annotations were specified ([#4300](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4300), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix bug where we attempted to chown with the mappings configured on server level, when they could have been from annotations ([#4294](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4294), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Fix making /etc/resolv.conf bind-mount to be readonly for a readonly container. ([#4268](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4268), [@kolyshkin](https://github.com/kolyshkin))\r\n - Fix occasional \"chown: interrupted system call\" error on container creation. ([#4334](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4334), [@kolyshkin](https://github.com/kolyshkin))\r\n - Fixed bug that all custom sandbox annotations will be passed to OCI hooks and therefore are also available on the containers ([#4138](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4138), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Provide an option to run performance hooks via specifying allowed_annotations under the runtime handler configuration\r\n  [DEPRECATION] The run of performance hooks for the high-performance runtime handler without specifying allowed_annotations will be deprecated under release 1.21\r\n  [DEPRECATION] Usage of performance annotation with the true value, will be deprecated under release 1.21, instead, the disable value should be used ([#4389](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4389), [@cynepco3hahue](https://github.com/cynepco3hahue))\r\n\r\n#### Other (Cleanup or Flake)\r\n - Changed the output of the printed seccomp profile to JSON instead of the struct. The profile will be only printed on CRI-O startup and if the `--log-level`/`log_level` is set to `trace`. ([#4158](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4158), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Fixed a bug where a container creation failure caused that container to leak in the runtime ([#4198](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4198), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Uncategorized\r\n - Fix a goroutine leak when checking image pulling progress ([#4413](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4413), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Moves shm size to a handler-allowed annotation ([#4417](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4417), [@openshift-cherrypick-robot](https://github.com/openshift-cherrypick-robot))\r\n - Update broken link for podman tutorial ([#4179](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4179), [@lovebaby979](https://github.com/lovebaby979))\r\n - Update broken link for tutorials ([#4180](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4180), [@lovebaby979](https://github.com/lovebaby979))\r\n - Update nix pin with `make nixpkgs` ([#4347](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4347), [@hswong3i](https://github.com/hswong3i))\r\n\r\n##

As a result, containers created in Podman 2.2.0 with image volumes will not have them in v2.2.1, and these containers will need to be re-created.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would, on systems without the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable defined, use an incorrect path for the PID file of the Podman pause process, causing Podman to fail to start ([#8539](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8539)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers created using Podman v1.7 and earlier were unusable in Podman due to JSON decode errors ([#8613](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8613)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could retrieve invalid cgroup paths, instead of erroring, for containers that were not running.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman system reset` command would print a warning about a duplicate shutdown handler being registered.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to mount `sysfs` in circumstances where it was not allowed; some OCI runtimes (notably `crun`) would fall back to alternatives and not fail, but others (notably `runc`) would fail to run containers.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman create` commands would fail to create containers from untagged images ([#8558](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8558)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where remote Podman would prompt for a password even when the server did not support password authentication ([#8498](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8498)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman exec` command did not move the Conmon process for the exec session into the correct cgroup.\r\n- Fixed a bug where shell completion for the `ancestor` option to `podman ps --filter` did not work correctly.\r\n- Fixed a bug where detached containers would not properly clean themselves up (or remove themselves if `--rm` was set) if the Podman command that created them was invoked with `--log-level=debug`.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the `Binds` and `Mounts` parameters in `HostConfig`.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers ignored the `Name` query parameter.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle the \"default\" value for `NetworkMode` (this value is used extensively by `docker-compose`) ([#8544](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8544)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images would sometimes incorrectly use the `target` query parameter as the image's tag.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Podman v2.2.0 vendored a non-released, custom version of the `github.com/spf13/cobra` package; this has been reverted to the latest upstream release to aid in packaging.\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.9.0\r\n", "created_at": "2020-12-07T23:00:20Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.19.0 \"Somali Gort\"", "tag_name": "v0.19.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.19.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 Custom Tasks \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.19.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.19.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.19.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.19.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.19.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Do not allow use of deprecated Conditions with custom tasks (#3601)\r\n\r\n   Disallow use of Conditions in pipeline tasks that reference custom tasks\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Plumb the TEKTON_RESOURCE_NAME env var into the cluster and PR reso\u2026 (#3555)\r\n\r\n   Binary file (standard input) matches\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Plumb the TEKTON_RESOURCE_NAME environment variable into more resou\u2026 (#3532)\r\n\r\n   Binary file (standard input) matches\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Add variable expansion for ImagePullPolicy in Tasks.

Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes. \r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup. \r\n \r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper. \r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied. \r\n \r\n- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster. \r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Please refer to the zero downtime upgrades feature to read more about it. \r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nThe following versions are now latest and stable:\r\n\r\n  |Type | Rancher Version | Docker Tag |Helm Repo| Helm Chart Version |\r\n  |---|---|---|---|---|\r\n  | Latest | v2.5.3 | `rancher/rancher:latest` | server-charts/latest |v2.5.3 |\r\n  | Stable | v2.5.3 | `rancher/rancher:stable` | server-charts/stable | v2.5.3 | \r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements \r\n* Introduced support for UAE north region in AKS [[#28341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28341)]\r\n\r\n## Major Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.10\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused very high CPU usage in clusters with Project Network Isolation enabled. [[https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30048](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30048)], [[#30089](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30089)], [[#30052](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30052)]. \r\n> Note: This requires redeploying `nginx-ingress-controller`. Please refer to [this comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30045#issuecomment-731653007) for more details. \r\n* Fixed an issue where windows node with Mirantis container runtime docker 19.03.13 failed to join the cluster. [[#30148](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30148)]\r\n\r\n## Minor Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.10\r\n* Fixed an UI issue where catalog apps would automatically upgrade to the latest version if they're upgraded without any changes. [[#27891](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27891)] \r\n* Fixed an issue where Elasticsearch logged timestamps in only seconds, not nanoseconds. [[#29078](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29078)]\r\n* Fixed an issue where configuring alerts would result into webhook not found error, even if alerts aren't webhook forwarded. [[#30088](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30088)]\r\n\r\n### Air Gap Installations and Upgrades\r\n\r\nIn v2.4.0, an air gap installation no longer requires mirroring the systems chart git repo. Please follow the directions on how to [install Rancher to use the packaged systems chart](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap/install-rancher).\r\n\r\n### Other Upgrades\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]\r\n- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\"API Server Request Rate\"_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]\r\n- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue.

Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components.  Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see [the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n\r\n**Important:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected. \r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-30T23:47:12Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "containerd 1.3.9", "tag_name": "v1.3.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.3.9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "body": "Welcome to the v1.3.9 release of containerd!\r\n\r\nThe ninth patch release for `containerd` 1.3 is a security release to address CVE-2020-15257.\r\nSee [GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4) for more details.\r\n\r\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\r\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n* Derek McGowan\r\n* Michael Crosby\r\n* Samuel Karp\r\n* Ted Yu\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<details><summary>5 commits</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n* [`ea765aba0`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/ea765aba0d05254012b0b9e595e995c09186427f) Merge pull request from GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4\r\n* [`25f3b2972`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/25f3b2972a6ca72f2c9e3785ff62dd227090d5fc) Prepare 1.3.9 releases notes\r\n* [`85d3b5c78`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/85d3b5c7894ac34724513a932e8a9fe4c11fd011) containerd-shim: use path-based unix socket\r\n* [`689d92ce1`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/689d92ce1c3d827e33b320d5d2bdab8c218d73fc) Use path based unix socket for shims\r\n* [`ea04599ed`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/ea04599edfee061506b0193df190485f390e00ea) Use named error return for service#StartShim\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\nThis release has no dependency changes\r\n\r\nPrevious release can be found at [v1.3.8](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.3.8)\r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-30T18:39:32Z", "project": "Containerd", "repo": "containerd/containerd", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v13.7.0-rc3", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits/5bdc821c42d50923fb54bf796ea9b7e447acbbe6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq", "body": "Ensure pipelines run for 13.7.0-rc3\n\nThe last commit synced to this repository includes the \"ci skip\" tag,\npreventing tag pipelines from running.

Before, zone-aware replication was implicitly enabled if a zone was set on ingesters. #3200\r\n* [CHANGE] Removed the deprecated CLI flag `-config-yaml`. You should use `-schema-config-file` instead. #3225\r\n* [CHANGE] Enforced the HTTP method required by some API endpoints which did (incorrectly) allow any method before that. #3228\r\n  - `GET /`\r\n  - `GET /config`\r\n  - `GET /debug/fgprof`\r\n  - `GET /distributor/all_user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /distributor/ha_tracker`\r\n  - `GET /all_user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /ha-tracker`\r\n  - `GET /api/v1/user_stats`\r\n  - `GET /api/v1/chunks`\r\n  - `GET <legacy-http-prefix>/user_stats`\r\n  - `GET <legacy-http-prefix>/chunks`\r\n  - `GET /services`\r\n  - `GET /multitenant_alertmanager/status`\r\n  - `GET /status` (alertmanager microservice)\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /store-gateway/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /compactor/ring`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/flush`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ingester/shutdown`\r\n  - `GET|POST /flush`\r\n  - `GET|POST /shutdown`\r\n  - `GET|POST /ruler/ring`\r\n  - `POST /api/v1/push`\r\n  - `POST <legacy-http-prefix>/push`\r\n  - `POST /push`\r\n  - `POST /ingester/push`\r\n* [CHANGE] Renamed CLI flags to configure the network interface names from which automatically detect the instance IP. #3295\r\n  - `-compactor.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-compactor.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-distributor.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-distributor.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n  - `-ruler.ring.instance-interface` renamed to `-ruler.ring.instance-interface-names`\r\n* [CHANGE] Renamed `-<prefix>.redis.enable-tls` CLI flag to `-<prefix>.redis.tls-enabled`, and its respective YAML config option from `enable_tls` to `tls_enabled`. #3298\r\n* [CHANGE] Increased default `-<prefix>.redis.timeout` from `100ms` to `500ms`. #3301\r\n* [CHANGE] `cortex_alertmanager_config_invalid` has been removed in favor of `cortex_alertmanager_config_last_reload_successful`. #3289\r\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: POST requests whose body size exceeds 10MiB will be rejected. The max body size can be customised via `-frontend.max-body-size`. #3276\r\n* [FEATURE] Shuffle sharding: added support for shuffle-sharding queriers in the query-frontend. When configured (`-frontend.max-queriers-per-tenant` globally, or using per-tenant limit `max_queriers_per_tenant`), each tenants's requests will be handled by different set of queriers. #3113 #3257\r\n* [FEATURE] Shuffle sharding: added support for shuffle-sharding ingesters on the read path. When ingesters shuffle-sharding is enabled and `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period` is set, queriers will fetch in-memory series from the minimum set of required ingesters, selecting only ingesters which may have received series since 'now - lookback period'. #3252\r\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: added `compression` config to support results cache with compression. #3217\r\n* [FEATURE] Add OpenStack Swift support to blocks storage. #3303\r\n* [FEATURE] Added support for applying Prometheus relabel configs on series received by the distributor. A `metric_relabel_configs` field has been added to the per-tenant limits configuration. #3329\r\n* [FEATURE] Support for Cassandra client SSL certificates. #3384\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Introduces two new limits `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group` and `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant` to control the number of rules per rule group and the total number of rule groups for a given user. They are disabled by default. #3366\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow to specify multiple comma-separated Cortex services to `-target` CLI option (or its respective YAML config option). For example, `-target=all,compactor` can be used to start Cortex single-binary with compactor as well. #3275\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose additional HTTP configs for the S3 backend client. New flag are listed below: #3244\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.idle-conn-timeout`\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.response-header-timeout`\r\n  - `-blocks-storage.s3.http.insecure-skip-verify`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `cortex_query_frontend_connected_clients` metric to show the number of workers currently connected to the frontend. #3207\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Shuffle sharding: improved shuffle sharding in the write path. Shuffle sharding now should be explicitly enabled via `-distributor.sharding-strategy` CLI flag (or its respective YAML config option) and guarantees stability, consistency, shuffling and balanced zone-awareness properties. #3090 #3214\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added new metric `cortex_ingester_active_series` to track active series more accurately. Also added options to control whether active series tracking is enabled (`-ingester.active-series-enabled`, defaults to false), and how often this metric is updated (`-ingester.active-series-update-period`) and max idle time for series to be considered inactive (`-ingester.active-series-idle-timeout`). #3153\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added zone-aware replication support to blocks replication in the store-gateway. #3200\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: exported new metrics. #3231\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_store_cached_series_fetch_duration_seconds`\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_store_cached_postings_fetch_duration_seconds`\r\n  - `cortex_bucket_stores_gate_queries_max`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `-version` flag to Cortex. #3233\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Hash ring: added instance registered timestamp to the ring. #3248\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce tail latency by smoothing out spikes in rate of chunk flush operations. #3191\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] User Cortex as User Agent in http requests issued by Configs DB client. #3264\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Experimental Ruler API: Fetch rule groups from object storage in parallel. #3218\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Chunks GCS object storage client uses the `fields` selector to limit the payload size when listing objects in the bucket. #3218 #3292\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added shuffle sharding support to ruler. Added new metric `cortex_ruler_sync_rules_total`. #3235\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Return an explicit error when the store-gateway is explicitly requested without a blocks storage engine. #3287\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: only load rules that belong to the ruler. Improves rules synching performances when ruler sharding is enabled. #3269\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `-<prefix>.redis.tls-insecure-skip-verify` flag. #3298\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `cortex_alertmanager_config_last_reload_successful_seconds` metric to show timestamp of last successful AM config reload. #3289\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: reduced number of bucket listing operations to list block content (applies to newly created blocks only). #3363\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Include the tenant ID on the notifier logs. #3372\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage Compactor: Added `-compactor.enabled-tenants` and `-compactor.disabled-tenants` to explicitly enable or disable compaction of specific tenants. #3385\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage ingester: Creating checkpoint only once even when there are multiple Head compactions in a single `Compact()` call. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage ingester: Read repair memory-mapped chunks file which can end up being empty on abrupt shutdowns combined with faulty disks. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage ingester: Close TSDB resources on failed startup preventing ingester OOMing. #3373\r\n* [BUGFIX] No-longer-needed ingester operations for queries triggered by queriers and rulers are now canceled. #3178\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: directories in the configured `rules-path` will be removed on startup and shutdown in order to ensure they don't persist between runs. #3195\r\n* [BUGFIX] Handle hash-collisions in the query path. #3192\r\n* [BUGFIX] Check for postgres rows errors. #3197\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler Experimental API: Don't allow rule groups without names or empty rule groups. #3210\r\n* [BUGFIX] Experimental Alertmanager API: Do not allow empty Alertmanager configurations or bad template filenames to be submitted through the configuration API. #3185\r\n* [BUGFIX] Reduce failures to update heartbeat when using Consul. #3259\r\n* [BUGFIX] When using ruler sharding, moving all user rule groups from ruler to a different one and then back could end up with some user groups not being evaluated at all. #3235\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed shuffle sharding consistency when zone-awareness is enabled and the shard size is increased or instances in a new zone are added. #3299\r\n* [BUGFIX] Use a valid grpc header when logging IP addresses. #3307\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed the metric `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_duration_seconds` in the Ruler, it wouldn't report any values. #3310\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed gRPC connections leaking in rulers when rulers sharding is enabled and APIs called. #3314\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed shuffle sharding consistency when zone-awareness is enabled and the shard size is increased or instances in a new zone are added. #3299\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed Gossip memberlist members joining when addresses are configured using DNS-based service discovery. #3360\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fail to start an ingester running the blocks storage, if unable to load any existing TSDB at startup. #3354\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: Avoid deletion of blocks in the ingester which are not shipped to the storage yet. #3346\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fix common prefixes returned by List method of S3 client. #3358\r\n* [BUGFIX] Honor configured timeout in Azure and GCS object clients. #3285\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: Avoid creating blocks larger than configured block range period on forced compaction and when TSDB is idle. #3344\r\n* [BUGFIX] Shuffle sharding: fixed max global series per user/metric limit when shuffle sharding and `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=true` are both enabled in distributor. When using these global limits you should now set `-distributor.sharding-strategy` and `-distributor.zone-awareness-enabled` to ingesters too. #3369\r\n* [BUGFIX] Slow query logging: when using downstream server request parameters were not logged. #3276\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed tenant detection in the ruler and alertmanager API when running without auth. #3343\r\n\r\n### Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Builder: download plan file locally before processing it. #3209\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Cleaner: added new tool for deleting chunks data. #3283\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: support for scanning specific date-range only. #3222\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: metrics for tracking progress. #3222\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Builder: retry block upload before giving up. #3245\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocksconvert \u2013 Scanner: upload plans concurrently. #3340\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocksconvert: fix chunks ordering in the block. Chunks in different order than series work just fine in TSDB blocks at the moment, but it's not consistent with what Prometheus does and future Prometheus and Cortex optimizations may rely on this ordering. #3371", "created_at": "2020-11-09T18:15:27Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name":

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable. Thanks also to @anuraaga @jorgheymans @jcchavezs and @abesto for inputs and review.", "created_at": "2020-10-31T15:23:43Z", "project": "Zipkin", "repo": "openzipkin/zipkin", "type": "Tracing", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Vitess 8.0.0", "tag_name": "v8.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v8.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "body": "This release complies with VEP-3 which removes the upgrade order requirement.

This matches the default behavior of MySQL. #6749\r\n* Turn off schema tracker by default #6712\r\n\r\n## Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n### VTGate / MySQL compatibility\r\n* Fix where clause in information schema

Upgrading kops to 1.18.1 (or the latest versions of the 1.15, 1.16, 1.17 or 1.18 series) and running `kops update` followed by a `kops rolling-update` will fix the issue.  Please see [the advisory](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/advisories/etcd-manager-certificate-expiration/) for the full details.\r\n\r\n---\r\nkops 1.18.2 is the next patch release in the 1.18 series of kops, offering support for kubernetes 1.18.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/releases/1.18-NOTES.md) for the full list of changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Release notes for kops 1.18 series\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n* **The default image has been updated to [Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#ubuntu-2004-focal)**. Consequently, the SSH user changed to `ubuntu` and the Linux kernel changed to version 5.4.\r\n\r\n* To address the [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91507) of IPv4 only clusters being susceptible to MitM attacks via IPv6 rogue router advertisements, the affected components have been upgraded as follows:\r\n    * Docker version 19.03.11 - [CVE-2020-13401](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/v19.03.11)\r\n    * CNI plugins 0.8.6 - [CVE-2020-10749](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/tag/v0.8.6)\r\n    * Calico 3.15.1 - [CVE-2020-13597](https://www.projectcalico.org/security-bulletins/)\r\n    * Weave Net 2.6.5 - [CVE-2020-11091](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/security/advisories/GHSA-59qg-grp7-5r73)\r\n\r\n* Support for [RHEL 8](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#rhel-8) and [CentOS 8](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#centos-8) has been added.\r\n\r\n* Support for [Amazon Linux 2](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/images/#amazon-linux-2) has been improved and will work with the default Docker version.\r\n\r\n* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md) has been added and can be selected as an alternate container runtime for Kubernetes. Enable by using the `--container-runtime containerd` flag when creating a cluster or by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd`.\r\n\r\n* Rolling updates now support surging and parallelism within an instance group. For details see [the documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/rolling-update/).\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use AWS networking natively through the AWS ENI IPAM mode. Kops can also run a Kubernetes cluster entirely without kube-proxy using Cilium's BPF NodePort implementation.\r\n\r\n* Cilium CNI can now use a dedicated etcd cluster managed by etcd-manager for synchronizing agent state instead of CRDs.\r\n\r\n* The Terraform target now supports Terraform 0.12 syntax (HCL2) by default. See the Required Actions item below.\r\n\r\n* New clusters in GCE are configured to run the [metadata-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metadata-proxy) by default. The proxy runs as a DaemonSet and lands on nodes with the nodeLabel `cloud.google.com/metadata-proxy-ready: \"true\"`. If you want to enable metadata-proxy on an existing cluster/instance group, add that nodeLabel to your instancegroup specs (`kops edit ig ...`) and run `kops update cluster`. When the changes are applied, the proxy will roll out to those targeted nodes.\r\n\r\n* GCE has a new flag: `--gce-service-account`. This takes the email of an existing GCP service account and launches the instances with it. This setting applies to the whole cluster (ie: it is not currently designed to support Instance Groups with different service accounts). If you do not specify a service account during cluster creation, the default compute service account will be used which matches the prior behavior.\r\n\r\n* Google API client libraries updated from v0.beta to v1.\r\n\r\n* Support for [NodeLocalDNS cache](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cluster_spec/#node-local-dns-cache).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker versions 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 has been removed because of the [dockerproject.org shut down](https://www.docker.com/blog/changes-dockerproject-org-apt-yum-repositories/). Those affected must upgrade to a newer Docker version.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename some resources in their state file in order to prepare for Terraform 0.12 support. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the CoreOS OS distribution has been removed. Users should consider Flatcar as a replacement.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Debian 8 (Jessie) OS distribution has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Docker `health-check` service has been disabled by default. It shouldn't be needed anymore, but it can still be enabled by setting `spec.docker.healthCheck: true`. It is recommended to also check [node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) and [draino](https://github.com/planetlabs/draino) as replacements. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Network and internet access for `docker run` containers has been disabled by default, to avoid any unwanted interaction between the Docker firewall rules and the firewall rules of netwok plugins. This was the default since the early days of Kops, but a race condition in the Docker startup sequence changed this behaviour in more recent years. To re-enable, set `spec.docker.ipTables: true` and `spec.docker.ipMasq: true`.\r\n\r\n* Lyft CNI plugin default subnet tags changed from from `Type: pod` to `KubernetesCluster: myclustername.mydns.io`. Subnets intended for use by the plugin will need to be tagged with this new tag and [additional tag filters](https://github.com/lyft/cni-ipvlan-vpc-k8s#other-configuration-flags) may need to be added to the cluster spec in order to achieve the desired set of subnets.\r\n\r\n* Support for basic authentication has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and will be [removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89069) in Kubernetes 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for static tokens has been disabled by default for Kubernetes 1.18 and later. To re-enable, see the [Security Notes for Kubernetes](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/security/#api-bearer-token). We intend to remove support entirely in a future kops version, so file an issue with your use case if you need this feature. \r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. See Required Actions below.\r\n\r\n* Support for the \"Legacy\" etcd provider has been removed for Kubernetes versions 1.18 and higher. Such clusters will need to migrate to the default \"Manager\" etcd provider. To migrate, see the [etcd migration documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/etcd3-migration/).\r\n\r\n* A controller is now used to apply labels to nodes.  If you are not using AWS, GCE or OpenStack your (non-master) nodes may not have labels applied correctly.\r\n\r\n* The `kops.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API has been removed. Users of `kops replace` will need to supply v1alpha2 resources.\r\n\r\n* Please see the notes in the 1.15 release about the apiGroup changing from kops to kops.k8s.io\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename resources in their terraform state file in order to support Terraform 0.12.\r\n  Terraform 0.12 [no longer supports resource names starting with digits](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html#pre-upgrade-checklist). In Kops, both the default route and additional VPC CIDR associations are affected. See [#7957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/7957) for more information.\r\n  * The default route was named `aws_route.0-0-0-0--0` and will now be named `aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0`.\r\n  * Additional CIDR blocks associated with a VPC were similarly named the hyphenated CIDR block with two hyphens for the `/`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16`. These will now be prefixed with `cidr-`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16`.\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```\r\n  KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=-Terraform-0.12 kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform <0.12\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Observe any aws_route or aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association resources being destroyed and recreated\r\n  # Run these commands as necessary. The exact names may differ; use what is outputted by terraform plan\r\n  terraform state mv aws_route.0-0-0-0--0 aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0\r\n  terraform state mv aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16 aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n  Kops will now output Terraform 0.12 syntax with the normal workflow:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  # Use Terraform 0.12. This plan should be a no-op\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Users that need the Docker `health-check` service will need to explicitly enable it:\r\n```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    docker:\r\n      healthCheck: true\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. This is required for newer versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n  To enable the Pod priority feature, follow these steps:\r\n  ```\r\n  kops edit cluster\r\n  # Add the following section\r\n  spec:\r\n    kubelet:\r\n      featureGates:\r\n        PodPriority: \"true\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If a custom Kops build was used on a cluster, a kops-controller Deployment may have been created that should get deleted.\r\n  Run `kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment kops-controller` after upgrading to Kops 1.16.0-beta.1 or later.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n* AWS clusters with an ACM certificate attached to the API ELB (the cluster's `spec.api.loadBalancer.sslCertificate` is set) will need to reenable basic auth to use the kubeconfig context created by `kops export kubecfg`. Set `spec.kubeAPIServer.disableBasicAuth: false` before running `kops export kubecfg`. See [#9756](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9756) for more information.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.9 and 1.10 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions of Kops.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions is deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## All changes from 1.18.1 to 1.18.2\r\n\r\n* Add missing spot

this release from `3.7.15` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.\r\n\r\nBecause older RabbitMQ CLI tools can be incompatible with Erlang 22+ releases,\r\nRabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` on Erlang 21.3 first,\r\nthen Erlang 22.x or 23.x, then RabbitMQ to most recent 3.8.x release.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nAny questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Starting with `3.8.0`, an unintentionally introduced assertion could prevent classic mirrored queue\r\n   mirrors from starting successfully in case the primary replica changed concurrently with their startup.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2449](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2449)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Raft implementation's [failure detector](https://github.com/rabbitmq/aten) default polling interval has been increased from 1s to 5s.\r\n   The previously used default results in too frequent leader elections in networks with high packet loss\r\n   (say, double digit percent).\r\n\r\n   This has no correctness or safety ramifications, however, automated tests that assert on Raft properties\r\n   or expect a very fast leader re-election may have to set it back so that peer failures are detected quicker.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2450](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2450)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The now deprecated intrusive health check endpoint, `GET /api/healthchecks/node`, reported failures in the response\r\n   but always set the status to `200 OK`. It now uses the status of `500` in case of a failure.\r\n\r\n   [RabbitMQ Monitoring guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#health-checks) explains why\r\n   this health check is no longer recommended and what the alternatives are.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#840](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/840)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * When a client doubly encodes a request into JSON, the plugin tries to detect that and will produce a more\r\n   helpful 400 response instead of a 500.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#839](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/839)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When a classic mirrored queue with a replica on every cluster node (this is [highly discouraged](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#replication-factor)) was federated,\r\n   multiple links could be started by the plugin, potentially making message transfers concurrent\r\n   and affecting ordering.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#114](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/114)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * It is now possible to federate exchanges in different virtual hosts in the same cluster for more than one hop.\r\n   For example, federate messages from an exchange in virtual host B to C, while B itself is federated from\r\n   virtual host A. Previously such messages would have been filtered by the message cycle detection algorithm\r\n   which assumed that exchanges are only federated across clusters.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#116](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/116)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Kubernetes API events registered by this plugin mixed up reason and message fields.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by Gabriele Santomaggio.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s#70](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s/pull/70)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 AuthN/AuthZ Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Improved compatibility with Azure AD. This plugin can now be configured to fetch scopes from a non-standard\r\n   field in the decoded token value (other than the standard `scopes` field).\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @Robert-Gustafsson.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#53](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/pull/53)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source code archives\r\n\r\n**Warning**: The source code archive provided by GitHub only contains the source of the broker, not the plugins or the client libraries.\r\nPlease download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.8.9.tar.xz`.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-09-24T17:48:15Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.27.4", "tag_name": "1.27.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose", "body": "# Bugs\r\n\r\n- Remove path checks for bind mounts\r\n\r\n- Fix port rendering to output long form syntax for non-v1\r\n\r\n- Add protocol to the docker socket address", "created_at": "2020-09-24T15:17:20Z", "project": "Docker-compose", "repo": "docker/compose", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.6", "tag_name": "v1.0.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly/releases/tag/v1.0.6", "repo_url": "https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly", "body": "support preheat for register.

You can now manage the deployment of applications atop Kubernetes clusters using the familiar Portainer UX. This release is a big one & introduces a total of 101 changes to Portainer, meaning it needs to be tested in your environment before upgrading your production instances of Portainer 1.xx to Portainer 2.0.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** There are a number of breaking changes, and changes to functionality that require analysis, specifically a re-engineering of the application templates feature, removal of support for VMWare VIC, and removal of support for externally defined endpoints.\r\n\r\nIF YOU ARE RUNNING A \"HISTORIC\" VERSION OF PORTAINER (IE OLDER AND 1.23.X) PLEASE EITHER FIRST UPGRADE TO 1.24.1 AND/OR BACKUP YOUR PORTAINER.DB FILE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO UPGRADE TO CE 2.0; THERE ARE REPORTED ISSUES OF DB CORRUPTION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO UPGRADE FROM SUCH AND OLD VERSION TO LATEST IN ONE STEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes:\r\n* We have released CE 2.0 as `portainer/portainer-ce` to ensure auto-updaters (like watchtower) don't expose users to risks by automatically updating on release.\r\n* Extensions have now been removed; there is now no ability to use RBAC, Registry Manager, or External Authentication extensions in CE 2.0 (Extension customers will be communicated directly with a free license for the upcoming Portainer Business Edition). **EXTENSION USERS, DO NOT UPGRADE TO PORTAINER CE 2.0**\r\n* Port 8000 is now exposed by default. Reverse proxy configurations that don't specify a port for the load balancer will now likely need to do so: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3963\r\n* The `--no-auth` flag was removed as part of support for setting a custom timeout: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3846\r\n* Support for external endpoints has been removed along with the `--external-endpoints` flag. **WARNING:** migrating to this version with external endpoints defined will render them un-manageable: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3832\r\n* Support for VIC environments has been removed: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3834\r\n* The `--no-snapshot` flag has been removed, instances migrating with this flag will revert to default snapshot interval: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3804\r\n* Host jobs are now an edge-exclusive feature: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3745\r\n* The `--no-analytics` flag will be kept to allow migration of instances running a previous version of Portainer with this flag enabled, to version 2.0 where enabling this flag will have no effect.\r\n* Changed templates syntax to support versioning, a migration tool can be found [here](https://github.com/portainer/helper-templates) for your convenience:  https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3708\r\n* The `--sync-interval` flag was removed as part of the removal of external endpoints: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3832\r\n* Removed template management features & the `--templates-file` flag. **NOTE:** Users will no longer be able to create container templates via UI: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3707\r\n\r\n## Security:\r\n* Enforced the security setting \"disable the use of bind mounts\" when set via API:  https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106\r\n* Disabled Container Capabilities for non-admins: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4105\r\n* Enforce use of TLS 1.2 and recommended ciphers: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4070\r\n* Prevent non-admin users from running containers using the host namespace PID: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4068\r\n* Added a setting to disable the creation of stacks by non-admin users: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4067\r\n* Added a setting to disable device mapping by non admin users: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4066\r\n* Ensure users cannot create privileged containers via the API: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4065\r\n* Disabled ability for a regular user to re-create/edit/duplicate containers if a related security setting is enabled: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4069\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes:\r\n* Introduce support for Kubernetes: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/1637\r\n* Added the ability to apply taints and labels to nodes: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4005\r\n* Added the ability to expose an application via ingress: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4004\r\n* Added the ability to set placement constraints/preferences when deploying/editing an application: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4003\r\n* Added the ability to set the auto-scale policy of an application: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4002\r\n* Added the ability to use existing volumes when creating an application: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4001\r\n* Added the ability to download application/stack logs: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3998\r\n* Added support for multi-container pod applications: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4010\r\n* Added a link to the kubernetes endpoint configuration in the sidebar: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4179\r\n* Added checks when reducing the Quota assigned to a RP: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4144\r\n* Added form validation for placement constraints: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4213\r\n* Enhanced the used by column for volumes: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4012\r\n* Allow an administrator user to see which node the API is running on: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3996\r\n* Allow an administrator user to see which node hosts the leader components for `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager`: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3995\r\n* Allow an administrator user to see the status of the underlying cluster components: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3992\r\n* Allow any user to see the provisioner associated to any volume: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3997\r\n* Allow any user to inspect the tolerations and affinities associated to an application deployed inside or outside of Portainer: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3994\r\n* Allow any user to see the underlying workload associated to an application: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3993\r\n* Allow any user to see how an application (deployed inside or outside of Portainer) is exposed through an Ingress resource: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3991\r\n* Allow any user to inspect the auto-scaling policy (if any) associated to an application deployed inside or outside of Portainer.: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3989\r\n* Allow any user to see which application is using a volume directly in the volume list view: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3988\r\n* Allow any user to list all the storage used in their cluster with the total size used for each storage.: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3999\r\n* Prevent resource assignment when editing a resource pool, if not permitted at creation time:

auto-scaling policy on an application so as to default to the current instance count: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4183\r\n* Fixed LDAP Auth not working with underscore Usernames: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4141\r\n* Removed the kubernetes RC banner: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4204\r\n\r\n## Analytics:\r\n* Replaced Google Analytics with our own custom telemetry leveraging Matomo: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/3742\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of GDPR rules and the GDPR compliance recommendations provided by Matomo (the telemetry tool we are using for analytics) it was determined we will use the opt-out data collection mechanism. The reason for this assessment is that we are not collecting **ANY** personally identifiable data (all data is anonymized), and the data we collect is solely for our Legitimate business interests, and is not sold or provided to any 3rd parties.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity, we do not collect **ANY** user identifiable or personal information at any time, all statistics collected are anonymous and we have no way of identifying the Portainer instances reporting, nor the users using the application.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE ALSO NOTE:** The `--no-analytics` flag will be kept to allow migration of instances running a previous version of Portainer with this flag enabled, to version 2.0 where enabling this flag will have no effect.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to our [updated privacy policy](https://www.portainer.io/documentation/in-app-analytics-and-privacy-policy/)\r\n\r\n## Authentication & UAC:\r\n* Integrated the external authentication extension:
