The metric indicates the percentage of time that RabbitMQ has attempted a delivery\r\n   to a consumer of a queue, and was allowed to do so by the [channel prefetch value](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html#channel-qos-prefetch) and\r\n   the number of currently unacknowledged deliveries.\r\n\r\n   For queues that have no consumers, the metric now returns 0%. For consumers that accept all deliveries\r\n   attempted, the metric will be around 100% (optimal).\r\n\r\n   For queues that do have consumers but no traffic the metric will be at 100%. The assumption here is that consumers\r\n   can absorb all the load. This case is intentionally treated differently from the one above with no online consumers.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2843](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2843)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Consumer utilisation metric has been renamed to consumer capacity which more accurately represents\r\n   what it measures. See a more detailed note above in the Management plugin section.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2843](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2843)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Federation Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues now can be federated.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2756](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2756)\r\n\r\n * Exchange federation now supports a new option, `channel_use_mode`, which allows a single\r\n   channel to be used for all federation link activity if set to `single`:\r\n\r\n   ``` shell\r\n   rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream dc-2 '{\"uri\":\"amqp://dc2.messaging.coolcorp.local:5672\", \"channel-use-mode\": \"single\"}'\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   This helps avoid a race condition between topology changes and message flow\r\n   and the cost of topology operations reducing message transfer rates and increasing\r\n   rate variability.\r\n\r\n   The default value is `multiple`. It means that every link will use multiple channels (one for message transfer,\r\n   one for topology changes, etc), which has been the case since rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#97.\r\n   This is the recommended mode for most environments, and all environments with a mostly static topology.\r\n\r\n   See [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#97](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/pull/97) for the background.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2829](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2829)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AMQP 1.0 Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The plugin could run into unhandled exceptions.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2830](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2830)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 AuthN/AuthZ Backend\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Several settings of the plugin are now exposed to `rabbitmq.conf` and provide validations:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   auth_backends.1 = oauth2\r\n   auth_oauth2.resource_server_id = a_resource_server_id\r\n   auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key = a_custom_scope_key\r\n   auth_oauth2.default_key = id1\r\n   auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id1 = /path/to/signing.key1.pem\r\n   auth_oauth2.signing_keys.id2 = /path/to/signing.key2.pem\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2550](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2550)\r\n\r\n * JWT tokens now can be fetched from a JWKS endpoint provided using the `rabbitmq_auth_backend_oauth2.key_config.jwks_url`\r\n   key in `advanced.config`.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by Teo @teozkr Klestrup R\u00f6ijezon.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#2791](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2791)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * `lager` was [upgraded to 3.8.2](https://github.com/erlang-lager/lager/compare/3.8.0..3.8.2)\r\n * `cuttlefish` was [upgraded to 2.6.0](https://github.com/kyorai/cuttlefish/compare/v2.4.0..v2.6.0)\r\n * `credentials_obfuscation` was [upgraded to 2.4.0](https://github.com/rabbitmq/credentials-obfuscation/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#changes-between-230-and-240-february-18-2021)\r\n * `observer_cli` was [upgraded to 1.6.0](https://github.com/zhongwencool/observer_cli/compare/1.5.4..v1.6.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.8.13.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-27T16:16:19Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "KubeEdge v1.6.0 release", "tag_name": "v1.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/releases/tag/v1.6.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge", "body": "See [CHANGELOG-1.6.md](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.6.md) for details.", "created_at": "2021-02-27T12:16:27Z", "project": "KubeEdge", "repo": "kubeedge/kubeedge", "type": "Edge", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3.4.15", "tag_name": "v3.4.15", "html_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.4.15", "repo_url": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd", "body": "Please check out [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/CHANGELOG-3.4.md) for a full list of changes.

We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest release.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nBelow we highlight the most serious issues found, as well as the components of Teleport they affect.\r\n\r\n#### Teleport Application Access\r\n\r\nIf an attacker can convince a user to click on a malicious link, the attacker can steal the victim\u2019s session cookie or force them to log into an attacker controlled Application Access account.\r\n\r\n#### Trusted Clusters\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances, an already privileged user within a root cluster could potentially elevate their privileges further by gaining the exact same roles in the leaf as they have in the root cluster (instead of the mapped roles).\r\n\r\n#### All\r\n\r\nAn unauthenticated attacker that has network access to the Teleport Web Proxy could stage a DOS attack causing it to crash.\r\n\r\n#### Changes In Behavior\r\n\r\n##### Trusted Clusters\r\n\r\nTrusted clusters now correctly handle role mapping for Kubernetes. If you had identically-named roles in root and leaf clusters for granting Kubernetes access, leaf clusters now use `kubernetes_users` and `kubernetes_groups` from the leaf role instead of the root role.\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\nFor all users, we recommend upgrading the Teleport Proxy process.\r\n\r\nFor Application Access users, we also recommend upgrading the Application Access processes.\r\n\r\nFor Trusted Cluster users, we also recommend upgrading the Teleport Auth process within both leaf and root clusters.\r\n\r\nFor Kubernetes Access users who rely on Trusted Clusters, we recommend reviewing the leaf cluster roles and making sure that they grant the correct `kubernetes_users` and `kubernetes_groups`.\r\n\r\nUpgrades should follow the normal Teleport upgrade procedure: https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nDownload one of the following releases to mitigate the issue:\r\n\r\n* Teleport 5.2.1*\r\n* Teleport 4.4.8\r\n* Teleport 4.3.10\r\n\r\n\\* For Enterprise customers, 5.2.1 is identical to 5.2.0. A new release had to be made due to an issue with the build process.\r\n\r\nAll current and previous releases of Enterprise can be downloaded from https://dashboard.goteleport.com.", "created_at":

This means Prometheus 1.6 support has been removed and the oldest Prometheus version supported in the remote write is 1.7. #3682\r\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed the flag `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration-deprecated` which was deprecated in 1.4.0. Please use the `ruler_evaluation_delay_duration` per-tenant limit instead. #3694\r\n* [CHANGE] Removed the flags `-<prefix>.grpc-use-gzip-compression` which were deprecated in 1.3.0: #3694\r\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-ruler.client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-ruler.client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-bigtable.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-bigtable.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-ingester.client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-ingester.client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-use-gzip-compression`: use `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-compression` instead\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier: it's not required to set `-frontend.query-stats-enabled=true` in the querier anymore to enable query statistics logging in the query-frontend. The flag is now required to be configured only in the query-frontend and it will be propagated to the queriers. #3595 #3695\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: compactor is now required when running a Cortex cluster with the blocks storage, because it also keeps the bucket index updated. #3583\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: block deletion marks are now stored in a per-tenant global markers/ location too, other than within the block location. The compactor, at startup, will copy deletion marks from the block location to the global location. This migration is required only once, so you can safely disable it via `-compactor.block-deletion-marks-migration-enabled=false` once new compactor has successfully started once in your cluster. #3583\r\n* [CHANGE] OpenStack Swift: the default value for the `-ruler.storage.swift.container-name` and `-swift.container-name` config options has changed from `cortex` to empty string. If you were relying on the default value, you should set it back to `cortex`. #3660\r\n* [CHANGE] HA Tracker: configured replica label is now verified against label value length limit (`-validation.max-length-label-value`). #3668\r\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: `extend_writes` field in YAML configuration has moved from `lifecycler` (inside `ingester_config`) to `distributor_config`. This doesn't affect command line option `-distributor.extend-writes`, which stays the same. #3719\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Deprecated `-cluster.` CLI flags in favor of their `-alertmanager.cluster.` equivalent. The deprecated flags (and their respective YAML config options) are: #3677\r\n  * `-cluster.listen-address` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.listen-address`\r\n  * `-cluster.advertise-address` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.advertise-address`\r\n  * `-cluster.peer` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.peers`\r\n  * `-cluster.peer-timeout` in favor of `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout`\r\n* [CHANGE] Blocks storage: the default value of `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.sync-interval` has been changed from `5m` to `15m`. #3724\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Queries can be federated across multiple tenants. The tenants IDs involved need to be specified separated by a `|` character in the `X-Scope-OrgID` request header. This is an experimental feature, which can be enabled by setting `-tenant-federation.enabled=true` on all Cortex services. #3250\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: introduced the experimental option `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled` to shard tenants across multiple Alertmanager instances. This feature is still under heavy development and its usage is discouraged. The following new metrics are exported by the Alertmanager: #3664\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_ring_check_errors_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_sync_configs_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_sync_configs_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_tenants_discovered`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_tenants_owned`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow specifying JAEGER_ENDPOINT instead of sampling server or local agent port. #3682\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: introduced a per-tenant bucket index, periodically updated by the compactor, used to avoid full bucket scanning done by queriers, store-gateways and rulers. The bucket index is updated by the compactor during blocks cleanup, on every `-compactor.cleanup-interval`. #3553 #3555 #3561 #3583 #3625 #3711 #3715\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: introduced an option `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled` to enable the usage of the bucket index in the querier, store-gateway and ruler. When enabled, the querier, store-gateway and ruler will use the bucket index to find a tenant's blocks instead of running the periodic bucket scan. The following new metrics are exported by the querier and ruler: #3614 #3625\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_loads_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_load_failures_total`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_load_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_loaded`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: exported the following metrics. #3583 #3625\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_count`: Total number of blocks per tenant in the bucket. Includes blocks marked for deletion, but not partial blocks.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_marked_for_deletion_count`: Total number of blocks per tenant marked for deletion in the bucket.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_blocks_partials_count`: Total number of partial blocks.\r\n  * `cortex_bucket_index_last_successful_update_timestamp_seconds`: Timestamp of the last successful update of a tenant's bucket index.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `cortex_prometheus_last_evaluation_samples` to expose the number of samples generated by a rule group per tenant. #3582\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: add status page (/memberlist) with available details about memberlist-based KV store and memberlist cluster. It's also possible to view KV values in Go struct or JSON format, or download for inspection. #3575\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: client can now keep a size-bounded buffer with sent and received messages and display them in the admin UI (/memberlist) for troubleshooting. #3581 #3602\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: added block index attributes caching support to metadata cache. The TTL can be configured via `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.metadata-cache.block-index-attributes-ttl`. #3629\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add support for Azure blob storage. #3634\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: tenants marked for deletion will now be fully cleaned up after some delay since deletion of last block. Cleanup includes removal of remaining marker files (including tenant deletion mark file) and files under `debug/metas`. #3613\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: retry compaction of a single tenant on failure instead of re-running compaction for all tenants. #3627\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Implement result caching for tenant query federation. #3640\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] API: Add a `mode` query parameter for the config endpoint: #3645\r\n  * `/config?mode=diff`: Shows the YAML configuration with all values that differ from the defaults.\r\n  * `/config?mode=defaults`: Shows the YAML configuration with all the default values.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OpenStack Swift: added the following config options to OpenStack Swift backend client: #3660\r\n  - Chunks storage: `-swift.auth-version`, `-swift.max-retries`, `-swift.connect-timeout`, `-swift.request-timeout`.\r\n  - Blocks storage: ` -blocks-storage.swift.auth-version`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.max-retries`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.connect-timeout`, ` -blocks-storage.swift.request-timeout`.\r\n  - Ruler: `-ruler.storage.swift.auth-version`, `-ruler.storage.swift.max-retries`, `-ruler.storage.swift.connect-timeout`, `-ruler.storage.swift.request-timeout`.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Disabled in-memory shuffle-sharding subring cache in the store-gateway, ruler and compactor. This should reduce the memory utilisation in these services when shuffle-sharding is enabled, without introducing a significantly increase CPU utilisation. #3601\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Shuffle sharding: optimised subring generation used by shuffle sharding. #3601\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New /runtime_config endpoint that returns the defined runtime configuration in YAML format. The returned configuration includes overrides. #3639\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: included the parameter name failed to validate in HTTP 400 message. #3703\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fail to startup Cortex if provided runtime config is invalid. #3707\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add flags to customize the cluster configuration: #3667\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.gossip-interval`: The interval between sending gossip messages. By lowering this value (more frequent) gossip messages are propagated across cluster more quickly at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.\r\n  * `-alertmanager.cluster.push-pull-interval`: The interval between gossip state syncs. Setting this interval lower (more frequent) will increase convergence speeds across larger clusters at the expense of increased bandwidth usage.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: change the error message returned when a received series has too many label values. The new message format has the series at the end and this plays better with Prometheus logs truncation. #3718\r\n  - From: `sample for '<series>' has <value> label names; limit <value>`\r\n  - To: `series has too many labels (actual: <value>, limit: <value>) series: '<series>'`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve bucket index loader to handle edge case where new tenant has not had blocks uploaded to storage yet. #3717\r\n* [BUGFIX] Allow `-querier.max-query-lookback` use `y|w|d` suffix like deprecated `-store.max-look-back-period`. #3598\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: Entry in the ring should now not appear again after using \"Forget\" feature (unless it's still heartbeating). #3603\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: do not close idle TSDBs while blocks shipping is in progress. #3630 #3632\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: correctly update `cortex_ingester_memory_users` and `cortex_ingester_active_series` when a tenant's idle TSDB is closed, when running Cortex with the blocks storage. #3646\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix default value incorrectly overriding `-querier.frontend-address` in single-binary mode. #3650\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: delete `deletion-mark.json` at last when deleting a block in order to not leave partial blocks without deletion mark in the bucket if the compactor is interrupted while deleting a block. #3660\r\n* [BUGFIX] Blocks storage: do not cleanup a partially uploaded block when `meta.json` upload fails. Despite failure to upload `meta.json`, this file may in some cases still appear in the bucket later.

Harbor is now built using Golang v1.15.6 as of this release.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Considerations\r\n- **Certificate Impact**:  Since Harbor is compiled by Golang v1.15.6, the certificates may need to be updated. Go `1.15.0` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates are generated by Harbor prepare script. For more information, see Go GitHub issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39568.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n   - Deprecate built-in Clair.  Users still have the option to install Clair in out-of-tree fashion by pairing with Harbor through its interrogation services framework.\r\n   - The ChartMuseum is scheduled to be deprecated in a future v2.4.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n- **API**:  The `/systeminfo` API now displays less information when the request is triggered by an unauthenticated user.  For details please  refer to the following issue comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/9149#issuecomment-733662106\r\n- **Scan Report**:  After upgrading to v2.2, all scan reports in the previous version have been deleted due to changes in the vulnerability database scheme.

In order to export the config on cluster update, you need to either add the `--user <user>` to reference an existing user, or `--admin` to export the cluster admin user. If neither flag is passed, the kubernetes config will not be modified. This makes it easier to reuse user definitions across clusters should you, for example, use OIDC for authentication.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `kops export kubecfg` will also require passing either the `--admin` or `--user` flag if the context does not already exist.\r\n\r\nBy default, the credentials of any exported admin user now have a lifetime of 18 hours. The lifetime of the exported\r\ncredentials may be specified as a value of the `--admin` flag. To get the previous behavior, specify `--admin=87600h` to either `kops update cluster` or `kops export kubecfg`.\r\n\r\n`kops create cluster --yes` exports the admin user along with rest of the cluster config, as was the previous behaviour (except for the 18-hour validity).\r\n\r\n## ARM64 support\r\n\r\nkOps will install ARM64 artifacts and containerd images when the instance group supports ARM64 for both machine type and OS image. At the moment this is known to work with AWS m6g, c6g, r6g and t4g instances, with the latest Ubuntu 20.04 OS images for ARM64.\r\n\r\n## OpenStack Cinder plugin\r\n\r\nkOps will install the Cinder plugin for kOps running kubernetes 1.16 or newer. If you already have this plugin installed you should remove it before upgrading.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a default `StorageClass`, you should set `cloudConfig.Openstack.BlockStorage.CreateStorageClass: false` to prevent kOps from installing one.\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes by kind\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n* New clusters will now have one nodes group per zone. The number of nodes now defaults to the number of zones.\r\n\r\n* On AWS kOps now defaults to using launch templates instead of launch configurations.\r\n\r\n* There is now Alpha support for Hashicorp Vault as a store for secrets and keys. See the [Vault state store docs](/state/#vault-vault).\r\n\r\n* The lifetimes of certificates used by various components have been substantially reduced.\r\nThe certificates on a node will expire sometime between 455 and 485 days after the node's creation.\r\nThe expiration times vary randomly so that nodes are likely to have their certs expire at different times than other nodes.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports using an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) for API access.\r\nSee the [documentation](/cluster_spec/#load-balancer-class) for more info.\r\n\r\n* Allow users to partially compress user-data, check the instance groups docs for more details.\r\n\r\n* Worker nodes on AWS will now be bootstrapped using kops-controller.\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n* The `kops update cluster` command will now refuse to run on a cluster that\r\nhas been updated by a newer version of kOps unless it is given the `--allow-kops-downgrade` flag.\r\n\r\n* New command for deleting a single instance: [kops delete instance](/docs/cli/kops_delete_instance/)\r\n\r\n### CNI\r\n\r\n* Clusters using the Amazon VPC CNI provider now perform an `ec2.DescribeInstanceTypes` call at instance launch time. In large clusters or AWS accounts this may lead to API throttling which could delay node readiness. If this becomes a problem please open a GitHub issue.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico with `CrossSubnet` enabled will switch to the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) for disabling the [AWS source/destination checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck). The previous implementation using [k8s-ec2-srcdst](https://github.com/ottoyiu/k8s-ec2-srcdst) is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now enable the [eBPF dataplane](https://docs.projectcalico.org/about/about-ebpf) mode for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.bpfEnabled: true` and `spec.kubeProxy.enabled: false` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Clusters using Calico can now encrypt pod-to-pod traffic with [WireGuard](https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic) for Ubuntu hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.wireguardEnabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Cilium now enable BPF NodePort by default if the Kubernetes version is 1.12 or newer.\r\n\r\n### Addons\r\n\r\n* Metrics Server is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.metricsServer.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cluster Autoscaler is now availalble as a configurable addon. Add `spec.clusterAutoscaler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* AWS Node Termination Handler is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.nodeTerminationHandler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.\r\n\r\n* Cilium will enable `enable-remote-identity` by default. This can affect network policies. If you want to keep old behaviour, add `spec.networking.cilium.enableRemoteIdentity: false` in your cluster spec.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes 1.9 and 1.10 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Romana networking provider has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for legacy IAM permissions has been removed. This removal may be temporarily deferred to kOps 1.20 by setting the `LegacyIAM` feature flag.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* See note about [Openstack Cinder plugin](#openstack-cinder-plugin) above.\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS, in order to prevent downtime you will have to remove the state of any existing ELB or TargetGroup attachments from your Terraform state file. This is due to migrating the attachments to the in-line `aws_autoscaling_group` fields. See the [terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group) for more information about the difference. This migration is required due to a bug described in [#9913](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9913).\r\n\r\n  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_autoscaling_attachment | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform 0.12 users on AWS migrating clusters from Launch Configurations to Launch Templates may need to remove the state of the old Launch Configuration. This is due to potential errors with Terraform attempting to delete the Launch Configuration before updating the AutoScalingGroup to use the Launch Template. The Launch Configurations will need to be manually deleted afterwards.\r\n  More information including detailed remediation steps is available in [#10017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/10017).\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform state list | grep aws_launch_configuration | xargs -L1 terraform state rm\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Ensure launch configurations are not being destroyed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename their EBS Volume resources to match 0.12's stricter naming requirements. Volumes whose Terraform resource name begin with a digit are now prefixed with `ebs-`. This change will be made regardless of `Terraform-0.12` feature flag value. More information is available in [#9982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/9982).\r\n  When upgrading to kOps 1.19, follow these steps to determine if a rename is necessary:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  kops update cluster --target terraform ...\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Look for any EBS volumes being recreated\r\n  # Adjust these arguments as necessary\r\n  terraform state mv aws_ebs_volume.1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local aws_ebs_volume.ebs-1a-etcd-events-foo-k8s-local\r\n  terraform plan\r\n  # Confirm no EBS volumes being changed\r\n  terraform apply\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* If you are using Terraform with an additional .tf file and using \"aws_autoscaling_attachment\" to attach additional Load Balancers or ALB/NLB Target Groups you'll need to migrate to [attaching them through the InstanceGroup spec instead](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#externalloadbalancers).\r\n\r\n* AWS clusters using an ACM Certificate on the API ELB (`.spec.api.loadBalancer.sslCertificateID`) will need to migrate from Classic LoadBalancer (CLB) to Network LoadBalancer (NLB) prior to upgrading to Kubernetes 1.19 by setting `.spec.api.loadBalancer.class: Network`.\r\n  Any kubeconfig files using kOps' admin client credentials will need to be regenerated with `kops export kubecfg --admin`.\r\n  For more information see [this page](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/permalinks/acm_nlb.md).\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.11 and 1.12 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for Docker container runtime has been deprecated and will be replaced with containerd for new clusters as of kOps 1.20. For existing clusters the default behaviour can be overridden by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd` in the cluster spec. This change closely tracks the upstream [deprecation of Docker](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker).\r\n\r\n* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20.\r\n\r\n* Support for feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.20. All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The experimental node authorizor is now ignored if you are using kubernetes 1.19.

frequently-occurring `WARN` level log messages have been downgraded to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to not clutter terminal output.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `Created` field of `podman ps --format=json` was formatted as a string instead of an Unix timestamp (integer) ([#9315](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9315)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where failing lookups of individual layers during the `podman images` command would cause the whole command to fail without printing output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `--cgroups=split` did not function properly on cgroups v1 systems.\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over an directory in the container that existed, but was empty, could fail ([#9393](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9393)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where mounting a volume over a directory in the container that existed could copy the entirety of the container's rootfs, instead of just the directory mounted over, into the volume ([#9415](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/9415)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would treat the `--entrypoint=[\"\"]` option to `podman run` and `podman create` as a literal empty string in the entrypoint, when instead it should have been ignored ([#9377](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9377)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would set the `HOME` environment variable to `\"\"` when the container ran as a user without an assigned home directory ([#9378](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9378)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where specifying a pod infra image that had no tags (by using its ID) would cause `podman pod create` to panic ([#9374](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9374)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--runtime` option was not properly handled by the `podman build` command ([#9365](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9365)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would incorrectly print an error message related to the remote API when the remote API was not in use and starting Podman failed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would change ownership of a container's working directory, even if it already existed ([#9387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9387)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd --new` command would incorrectly escape `%t` when generating the path for the PID file ([#9373](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9373)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could, when run inside a Podman container with the host's containers/storage directory mounted into the container, erroneously detect a reboot and reset container state if the temporary directory was not also mounted in ([#9191](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9191)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where some options of the `podman build` command (including but not limited to `--jobs`) were nonfunctional ([#9247](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9247)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a breaking change to the Libpod Wait API for Containers where the Conditions parameter changed type in Podman v3.0 ([#9351](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9351)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not properly handle forwarded ports that did not specify a host port.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Libpod Wait endpoint for Containers could write duplicate headers after an error occurred.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Images would not pull images that already had a matching tag present locally, even if a more recent version was available at the registry ([#9232](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/9232)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Images has had its compatibility with Docker improved, allowing its use with the `docker-java` library.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.19.4\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.24.6\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-18T20:16:12Z", "project": "Podman", "repo":

This driver is released as alpha and currently supports the following additional features compared to the non-CSI jiva volumes. \r\n   * Jiva Replicas are backed by OpenEBS host path volumes\r\n   * Auto-remount of volumes that are marked read-only by iSCSI client due to intermittent network issues\r\n   * Handle the case of multi-attach error sometimes seen on on-premise clusters\r\n   * A custom resource for Jiva volumes to help with easy access to the volume status\r\n   \r\n  For instructions on how to set up and use the Jiva CSI driver, please see. https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator.\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n\r\n- Several bug fixes to the Mayastor volumes along with improvements to the API documentation. See [Mayastor release notes](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor/releases/tag/v0.7.1). \r\n- Enhanced the [NFS Dynamic Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) to support using Cluster IP for dynamically provisioned NFS server. It was observed that on some of the Kubernetes clusters the kubelet or the node trying to mount the NFS volume was unable to resolve the cluster local service. \r\n- [ZFS Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) added support for resizing of the raw block volumes. \r\n- [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) is enhanced with additional features and some key bug fixes like:\r\n  * Raw block volume support\r\n  * Snapshot support\r\n  * Ability to schedule based on the capacity of the volumes provisioned\r\n  * Ensure that LVM volume creation and deletion functions are idempotent\r\n- NDM partition discovery was updated to fetch the device details from its parent block device.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue with cStor helm chart w.r.t to CVC operator service that was causing velero restores to fail. (https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/pull/239)\r\n- Fixed an issue with cStor CSPC validation causing failures in creating pools with ZFS supported compression algorithms. (https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/issues/237)\r\n- Fixed an issue with the cStor validation webhook not getting deleted in K8s 1.20+ when the OpenEBS namespace is deleted. https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3338)\r\n- Fixed an issue with Jiva replicas attempting duplicate registration if the Pod IP of the replica changes. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3323)\r\n- Fixed an issue where Jiva cleanup jobs can't be executed when cluster PSP is restrictive. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3331)\r\n- Fixed an issue where cStor pool migration from SPC to CSPC could result in pool failure when migration takes time and the user tries to restart the SPC pool. (https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/issues/82)\r\n- Fixed an issue with NDM partition discovery causing errors when partitions were present on top of filtered devices like OS disk. (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3321)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.17 or higher release is recommended as this release contains the following updates that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n  * The CSI components have been upgraded to: \r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-attacher:v3.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-node-driver-registrar:v2.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-provisioner:v2.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-resizer:v1.1.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-snapshotter:v4.0.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/snapshot-controller:v4.0.0\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/csi-snapshotter:v3.0.3 (for cStor CSI volumes)\r\n      * k8s.gcr.io/sig-storage/snapshot-controller:v3.0.3 (for cStor CSI volumes)\r\n\r\n- If you are upgrading from an older version of cStor operators to this version, you will need to manually delete the cStor CSI driver object prior to upgrading. `kubectl delete csidriver cstor.csi.openebs.io`. For complete details on how to upgrade your cStor operators, see https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/upgrade.md#cspc-pools.\r\n\r\n- The CRD API version has been updated for the cStor custom resources to v1. If you are upgrading via the helm chart, you might have to make sure that the new CRDs are updated. https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators/tree/master/deploy/helm/charts/crds\r\n\r\n- The e2e pipelines include upgrade testing only from 1.5 and higher releases to 2.6. If you are running on release older than 1.5, OpenEBS recommends you upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- OpenEBS has applied for becoming a CNCF incubation project and is currently undergoing a Storage SIG review of the project and addressing the review comment provided. One of the significant efforts we are taking in this direction is to upstream the changes done in uZFS to OpenZFS. \r\n- Automation of further Day 2 operations like -  automatically detecting a node deletion from the cluster, and re-balancing the volume replicas onto the next available node. \r\n- Migrating the CI pipelines from Travis to GitHub actions. \r\n- Several enhancements to the cStor Operators documentation with a lot of help from @survivant.\r\n- PSP support has been added to ZFS Local PV and cStor helm charts.\r\n- Improving the [OpenEBS Rawfile Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) in preparation for its beta release. In the current release, fixed some issues as well as added support for setting resource limits on the sidecar and few other optimizations.\r\n- Sample Grafana dashboards for managing OpenEBS are being developed here: https://github.com/openebs/charts/tree/gh-pages/grafana-charts\r\n\r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @coboluxx (IDNT) for becoming a public reference and supporter of OpenEBS by sharing your use case on [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS? You can help OpenEBS in its journey towards becoming a CNCF Incubation project by sharing your OpenEBS story and join the league of [OpenEBS Adopters](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2719).\r\n\r\n### Shout outs!\r\n\r\n_MANY THANKS_ to our existing contributors and for everyone helping OpenEBS Community going. \r\n\r\nA very special thanks to our  **first-time** contributors to code, tests, and docs:  @luizcarlosfaria, @Z0Marlin, @iyashu, @dyasny, @hanieh-m, @si458, @Ab-hishek\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite to install\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.17+ or newer release is installed. \r\n- Make sure that you run the below installation steps with the cluster-admin context. The installation will involve creating a new Service Account and assigning it to OpenEBS components.\r\n- Make sure [iSCSI Initiator](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/prerequisites.html) is installed on the Kubernetes nodes.\r\n- Node-Disk-Manager (NDM) helps in discovering the devices attached to Kubernetes nodes, which can be used to create storage pools. If you like to exclude some of the disks from getting discovered, update the filters in [NDM Config Map](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugndm.html) to exclude paths before installing OpenEBS.\r\n- NDM runs as a privileged pod since it needs to access the device information. Please make the necessary changes to grant access to run in privileged mode. For example, when running in RHEL/CentOS, you may need to set the security context appropriately.

If you are using the cStor Storage Engine, please review the following before upgrading to this release.\r\n\r\n- The recommended approach for deploying cStor Pools is using the new custom resource called cStorPoolCluster (CSPC). Even though the provisioning of cStor Pools using StoragePoolClaim(SPC) is supported, it will be deprecated in future releases. The pools provisioned using SPC can be easily migrated to CSPC.  \r\n- When using cStor Pools, make sure that raw block devices are available on the nodes. If the block devices are formatted with a filesystem or mounted, then cStor Pool will not be created on the block device. In the current release, there are [manual steps](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/t-volume-provisioning.html#cstor-pool-pod-not-running) that could be followed to clear the filesystem or use partitions for creating cStor Pools, please reach out to the community (#openebs) at https://slack.k8s.io.\r\n- If you are using cStor pools with ephemeral devices, starting with 1.2 - upon node restart, cStor Pool will not be automatically re-created on the new devices. This check has been put to make sure that nodes are not accidentally restarted with new disks. The steps to recover from such a situation are provided [here](https://github.com/openebs/maya/pull/1401#issue-308355304), which involves changing the status of the corresponding CSP to `Init`.\r\n- Capacity over-provisioning is enabled by default on the cStor pools. If you don\u2019t have alerts set up for monitoring the usage of the cStor pools, the pools can be fully utilized and the volumes can get into a read-only state. To avoid this, set up resource quotas as described in https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2855.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-15T17:27:44Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.15.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/openvswitch/ovs/commits/8dc1733eaea866dce033b3c44853e1b09bf59fc7", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs", "body": "Set release date for 2.15.0.\n\nAcked-by: Ian Stokes <ian.stokes@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ilya Maximets <i.maximets@ovn.org>", "created_at": "2021-02-15T17:21:23Z", "project": "Ovs", "repo": "openvswitch/ovs", "type": "Network", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "7.4.1", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/commits/428b97ba52430e69be0b6e92ae795dadf7574dce", "repo_url": "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet", "body": "Merge pull request #8511 from GabrielNagy/fix-gid-idempotency-main\n\n(PUP-10896) Fix gid idempotency on user resource", "created_at": "2021-02-10T16:34:53Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.3.2", "tag_name": "2.3.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kong/releases/tag/2.3.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/Kong/kong", "body": "**Download Kong 2.3.2 and run it now:**\n\n- https://konghq.com/install/\n- [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/kong/)\n\nLinks:\n- [2.3.2 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/2.3.2/CHANGELOG.md#232)", "created_at": "2021-02-09T18:21:37Z", "project": "Kong", "repo": "Kong/kong", "type": "Gateway", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.21.0 \"Savannah Ash\"", "tag_name": "v0.21.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.21.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "# \ud83c\udf89 WhenExpressions and Results in Finally Tasks \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.21.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.21.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.21.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.21.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.21.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n\r\n* The controller now requires that the SYSTEM_NAMESPACE environment variable is set.

Users are strongly recommended to update to this release. It fixes two security issues in upstream dependencies and one security issue in the Helm codebase.\r\n\r\nPlease review the following security advisories for context:\r\n\r\n- During an audit, Helm core maintainers discovered sanitization issues [described in a security advisory](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c38g-469g-cmgx). These have been fixed.\r\n- GoUtils (via Sprig) updated the [random alphanumeric functions](https://github.com/Masterminds/goutils/security/advisories/GHSA-xg2h-wx96-xgxr) used in Helm templates. Thanks to Open Source Developer Erik Sundell of Sundell Open Source Consulting AB for reporting this issue.\r\n- ORAS had a [security release](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c38g-469g-cmgx) that does not appear to directly impact Helm. However, we have merged it as a precaution.\r\n- The Go team renamed a crypto library (golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal to golang.org/x/term). This was NOT a security fix. But it was a breaking change to the Helm build.\r\n\r\n> **WARNING:** Helm is now stricter about sanitizing data in `Chart.yaml`, `index.yaml`, and `plugin.yaml`. In particular, we are stricter about SemVer strings.\r\n\r\nThe community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there!\r\n\r\n- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\r\n  -  for questions and just to hang out\r\n  -  for discussing PRs, code, and bugs\r\n- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/696660622)\r\n- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [GitHub/helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Upgrading\r\n\r\nDownload Helm v3.5.2.

Whenever upgrading to any Kubernetes version, please review the Kubernetes release notes for any breaking changes. \r\n\r\n- **Users using a single Docker container install** - Etcd in the Docker container has been upgraded from 3.3 to 3.4, therefore you *must* take a backup before upgrading in order to be able to roll back to a v2.3.x release. You will not be able to rollback without this backup. \r\n \r\n- **Users using node pools with RHEL/CentOS nodes [[#18065](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18065)]**: The default storage driver for RHEL/CentOS nodes has been updated to `overlay2`. If your node template does not specify a storage driver, any new node will be provisioned using the new updated default (`overlay`) instead of the old default (`devicemapper`). If you need to keep using `devicemapper` as your storage driver option, edit your node template to explicitly set the storage driver as `devicemapper. \r\n\r\n- **Users running Windows clusters [[#25582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/25582)]** - Windows has launched a security patch as of Feb 11. Before upgrading, please update your nodes to include this security patch, otherwise your upgrade will fail until the patch is applied. \r\n \r\n- **Rancher launched clusters require additional 500MB space** - By default, Rancher launched clusters have enabled audit logging on the cluster. \r\n\r\n- **Rancher launched Kubernetes clusters behavior of upgrades have changed [[#23897](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/23897)]** - Worker nodes are now upgraded in batches. Please refer to the [RKE documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/upgrades/maintaining-availability/) about how to upgrade clusters without downtime for applications.\r\n\r\n- **Restrict Kubernetes versions in Rancher helm chart to versions less than 1.20.0 [[#30746](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30746)]** - This restriction was added to prevent Rancher from being installed on incompatible versions of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements \r\n\r\n* Updated to use `v1.18.15-rancher1-1` and `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`\r\n* Allow for rancher-agent image to be pulled from cluster private registry. [[#26366](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/26366)]\r\n* Add support for configuring OpenLDAP with StartTLS [[#29810](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29810)]\r\n* Add option in the UI to use StartTLS for OpenLDAP [[#30348](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30348)]\r\n* Fixed Logging support for clusters with Windows Server SAC 1909 nodes and for clusters with Windows Server LTSC 2019 nodes. [[#30279](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30279)]\r\n* Logging system chart upgraded to version 0.2.3 [[#30569](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30569)]\r\n* Added disableMountSubPath option to Prometheus operator for monitoring system chart [[#29149](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29149)] \r\n* Added filter option for requests to get a template so that only version links compatible with cluster are returned. [[#30497](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30497)]\r\n* Added new Rancher external DNS system chart. [[#30186](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30186)]\r\n* Enable support for limiting Kubernetes versions of system charts. [[#29647](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29647)]\r\n\r\n## Major Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.12\r\n\r\n* Fixed issue with Rancher server pods crashing. [[#28293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28293)]\r\n\r\n## Minor Bugs Fixed Since v2.4.12\r\n\r\n* Fixed `confd` build issue to support Huawei Arm server. [[#30678](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30678) [PR](https://github.com/rancher/confd/pull/2)]\r\n* Added retry on conflict for errors encountered while enabling monitoring. [[#30290](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30290)]\r\n* Fixed an issue where EC2 instances failed to start when using Amazon Linux. [[#21648](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/21648)]\r\n* Properly remove vSphere vCenter server entries. [[#27306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27306)]\r\n* Fixed Logging v1 connection reset by peer error for AKS clusters. [[#30618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30618)]\r\n* Fixed UI issue where node template values were not changing while switching cloud credentials for vSphere. [[#30074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30074)]\r\n* Rancher's Istio installation now includes missing helm chart template for setting resource limits and requests on Istio sidecar containers with annotations. [[#28950]( https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28950)]\r\n\r\n### Air Gap Installations and Upgrades\r\n\r\nIn v2.4.0, an air gap installation no longer requires mirroring the systems chart git repo. Please follow the directions on how to [install Rancher to use the packaged systems chart](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap/install-rancher).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- When using monitoring with persistent storage for Grafana enabled, upgrading monitoring causes the pod to fail to start. Workaround steps are provided in the issue. [[#27450](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27450)]\r\n- When using monitoring, upgrading Kubernetes versions removes the _\"API Server Request Rate\"_ metric [[#27267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27267)]\r\n- When a new chart version is added to a helm 3 catalog, the upgrade process can default to helm 2, causing an api error. Workaround in issue.

Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components.  Plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see [the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n\r\n**Important:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade.

"body": "In `v0.10.0` the most important changes we're \"shipping\" are about improving sustainability:\r\n\r\n- Doubled the set of project owners, granting @aojea & @amwat full access to help maintain the project.\r\nA huge thank you to them for their existing contributions and for stepping up here :heart:\r\n- Rewritten and revamped contributor guide https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/getting-started/\r\n\r\nAdditionally we're trying a new approach to tracking [priorities for v0.11.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/2024) which you can see in our issue tracker.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we've made a number of bug fixes and minor improvements.\r\n\r\nSome users may appreciate the ability to run kind v0.10.0 (NOT the currently installed v0.7.0) in the free [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) for quick demos, workshops, etc.\r\n\r\nSimply install kind somewhere under $HOME and add it to your $PATH to use it in cloud shell:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGO111MODULE=on go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.10.0\r\nexport PATH=\"$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}\"\r\nkind create cluster\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo persist this `PATH` for future usage you can edit your `$HOME/.bashrc` in cloudshell.\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n- The default node image is a Kubernetes `v1.20.2` image: `kindest/node:v1.20.2@sha256:8f7ea6e7642c0da54f04a7ee10431549c0257315b3a634f6ef2fecaaedb19bab`\r\n- We're only actively supporting Kubernetes `v1.14.0`+, however limited best effort functionality still encompases `v1.13.0` for now.\r\n- Images from KIND `v0.8.0+` should continue to work for now, but lack various improvements.\r\n- udev is explicitly disabled at the node level, though as always please try not to depend on the inner details of nodes beyond providing a particular Kubernetes version with kind\r\n- IPv6 pod subnet defaults to /56 instead of /64 (a necessary fix for newer Kubernetes, see #1903)\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"new-features\">New Features</h1>\r\n\r\n- `kind export logs` now includes the kind version\r\n- Node images compiled without dockershim for Kubernetes v1.19+ possible, reducing size\r\n- Reduced kind binary size further (~7MB) with improved build options\r\n- Improved zsh completion\r\n- Experimental github actions CI for podman, docker, cgroupsv2\r\n- Expanded WSL2 documentation\r\n- Revamped contributor guide\r\n- Improved docs site implementation, including table of contents generation\r\n- Updated dependencies\r\n- New Loadbalancer user guide\r\n- Better support for running in nested container environments when using images built with v0.10.0+\r\n  - This enables cloud shell support\r\n\r\nNew Node images have been built for kind `v0.10.0`, please use these **exact** images (IE like `v1.20.2:@sha256:8f7ea6e7642c0da54f04a7ee10431549c0257315b3a634f6ef2fecaaedb19bab` including the digest) or build your own as we may need to

The following built-in functions have been implemented natively and no longer need to be supplied by SDKs: `graph.reachable`, `json.filter`, `json.remove`, `object.get`, `object.remove`, and `object.union`.\r\n\r\n- This release fixes several bugs in the Wasm implementation of certain `regex` built-in functions ([#2962](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2962)), `format_int` ([#2923](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2923)) and `round` ([#2999](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/2999)).\r\n\r\n- This release adds `ceil` and `floor` built-in functions. Previously these could be implemented in Rego using `round` however these are more convenient.\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- OPA has been extended support [OAuth2 JWT Bearer Grant Type](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/#oauth2-jwt-bearer-grant-type) and [OAuth2 Client Credential JWT](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/configuration/#oauth2-client-credentials-jwt-authentication) authentication options for communicating with control plane services. This change allows OPA to use services that rely on Ping Identity as well as GCP service accounts for authentication. OPA has also been extended to support [custom authentication plugins](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/configuration/#custom-plugin) (thanks @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11)).\r\n\r\n- OPA plugins can now enter a \"WARN\" state to indicate they are operating in a degraded capacity (thanks @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11)).\r\n\r\n- The `opa bench` command can now benchmark partial evaluation queries. The options to enable partial evaluation are shared with `opa eval`. See `opa bench --help` for details.\r\n\r\n- Wasm compiled policies now contain source locations that are included inside of runtime error messages (such as object key conflicts.) In addition, Wasm compiled policies only export the minimal set of APIs described on the [WebAssembly#exports](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/wasm/#exports) page.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- ast: Fix parsing of numbers to reject leading zeroes ([#2947](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2947)) authored by @[LCartwright](https://github.com/LCartwright).\r\n- bundle: Fix loader to only verify bundle keys if configured to do so ([#3028](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3028)).\r\n- cmd: Fix build to avoid packaging policy.wasm twice ([#3007](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3007)).\r\n- cmd: Fix pretty-printed PE output to hide spurious blank lines\r\n- server: Fix false-positive in bundle root check that would prevent data updates in some cases ([#2868](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2868)).\r\n- server: Fix query cache to respect ?instrument option ([#3000](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3000)).\r\n- server: Fix server to support discovery on inter-query cache configuration\r\n- topdown: Fix PE to avoid generating expressions that do not type check ([#3012](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3012)).\r\n- wasm: Fix planner to avoid generating a conflict error in some cases ([#2926](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2926)).\r\n- wasm: Fix planner to generate correct virtual document iteration instructions ([#3065](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3065)).\r\n- wasm, topdown: Fix with keyword handle to ensure last statement wins ([#3010]((https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3010))).\r\n- wasm: Fix planner to handle assignment conflicts correctly when else keyword is used ([#3031]((https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3031))).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Add new section on integrating policies with OAuth2 and OIDC.\r\n- Update Kubernetes admission control tutorial to work as non-root user.\r\n- Fix link to signing documentation ([#3027](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3027)) authored by @[princespaghetti](https://github.com/princespaghetti).\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- Previously, OPA deduplicated sets and objects in all cases except when iterating over/referring directly to values generated by partial rules. This inconsistency would only be noticed when running ad-hoc queries or within policies when aggregating the results of array comprehensions (e.g., `count([1 | p[x]])` could observe duplicates in `p`.) This release removes the inconsistency by deduplicating sets and objects in all cases ([#429](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/429)). This was the second oldest open issue on the project.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n\r\n- OPA now logs warnings when it receives legacy `bundle` config sections instead of the `bundles` section introduced in v0.13.0.", "created_at": "2021-01-20T18:21:11Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.8", "tag_name": "v1.0.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/tag/v1.0.8", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless", "body": "This release includes the following commits and features:\r\n- 579f8485 Update trigger controllers (#1215)\r\n- 51d84f30 Use bundled deps file with function file(url+zip etc.) (#1206)\r\n- 8eb6b466 use only 'function' and 'created-by' labels as deployment matchLabels (#1212)\r\n- c7ee7b57 Strict deployment loading from configmap (#1199)\r\n- 40088e83 Added completions for zsh, fish and powershell (#1193)\r\n- babd9c88 use `--no-cache-dir` flag to `pip` in dockerfiles to save space (#1189)\r\n- 50c2dc1c Use `--depth` flag to `git clone` in Dockerfiles, to save space (#1188)\r\n- 1fc330d2 architecture.md : fixing some typos (#1186)\r\n- 7b2c26d5 Build with Go 1.15 (#1143)\r\n- ffd182fb update kubectl logs cmmand and it's output (#1180)\r\n- 71df7727 update the deployment url of Kong (#1182)\r\n- 97854236 add AWS Kinesis Trigger (#1181)\r\n- b4d4c2b3 update the deployment.yaml url of NATS operator (#1178)\r\n- 1c5d1d48 update available triggers (#1177)\r\n- 583bf98f update the url of kinesis-trigger manifest (#1176)\r\n- 3320e4a2 update yaml output of CRD functions.kubeless.io (#1175)\r\n- 25d6376c Add secrets to runtime configuration (#1169)\r\n- b87adf86 Added support for function deployment from gzip/bzip2/xz compressed tar files (#1168)\r\n- d838585f Added option in kubeless command to specify service-account (#1165)\r\n- cab7c64f Display function list command with namespace argument after deploy/update.

Native RWX support (experimental)\r\n    1. See [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/advanced-resources/rwx-workloads/) for documentation.\r\n1. ARM64 support (experimental)\r\n    1. Longhorn now supports ARM64 architecture in addition to AMD64. You can deploy Longhorn as usual in ARM64 without any modification.\r\n1. [CSI Snapshotter support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/)\r\n    1. CSI Snapshotter is a new beta feature since Kubernetes v1.17. It allows users to create snapshots for volumes directly using the `kubectl` command. In Longhorn's context, those `CSI snapshots` will be mapped into `backups`. So after we add the support, Longhorn users will be able to create/restore backups for the volumes without using the Longhorn UI.\r\n1. [Prometheus support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/monitoring/)\r\n    1. We've added Prometheus endpoints and an example Grafana dashboard.\r\n    1. Now the users can easily use the existing monitoring solution to collect stats about the Longhorn, as well as set up alerts for certain situations.\r\n\r\n# Enhancements\r\n1. Enhanced failure recovery during Kubernetes node failure\r\n    1. [Automatic recovery for the StatefulSets](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/node-failure/#pod-deletion-policy-when-node-is-down).\r\n    1. [Improved recovery mechanism for volume failure](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/recover-volume/).\r\n    1. Rebuild based on existing replica after the node temporarily disconnected.\r\n1. [Better node maintenance support](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/volumes-and-nodes/maintenance/)\r\n    1. Automatically remove node when the node has been removed from Kubernetes.\r\n    1. Automatically recognized the existing disk on another node (e.g. reattached EBS on a different EC2 instance).\r\n    1. Support Kubernetes `drain`.\r\n    1. Support manually pause replica rebuild for server maintenance.\r\n    1. Support replica eviction for the nodes/disks.\r\n1. Support [`Data Locality` option](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/high-availability/data-locality/) to always keep a replica local to the engine.\r\n    1. The data locality feature will always try to keep a replica local to the workload, which guarantees even when the network interruption happens, the volume will continue working for the local workload.\r\n1. [Allow volume creation with degraded availability](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/references/settings/#allow-volume-creation-with-degraded-availability)\r\n    1. If the value is **true**, Longhorn will not prevent the volume creation as long as there is at least one replica has been scheduled successfully. It will help users with less than 3 nodes environment. Longhorn will automatically start rebuilding replicas if more available space on other nodes is found later.\r\n    1. The default value is **true**. Recommend value for **the production environment: false**.\r\n1. Improvement performance via removing revision counter (experimental).\r\n\r\n# Release note\r\n1. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn v1.1.0 is **v1.16**.\r\n2. The minimal required Kubernetes version for Longhorn with CSI Snapshotter is **v1.17**.\r\n    1. Please follow the instruction [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.1.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-snapshot-support/enable-csi-snapshot-support/) to install the CSI Snapshot Controller in your Kubernetes cluster if you want to use the CSI snapshot feature. \r\n1.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
