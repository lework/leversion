"### Features\r\n- The `podman manifest inspect` command now supports the `--authfile` option, for authentication purposes.\r\n- The `podman wait` command now supports `--condition={healthy,unhealthy}`, allowing waits on successful health checks.\r\n- The `podman push` command now supports a new option, ` --compression-level`, which specifies the compression level to use ([#18939](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18939)).\r\n- The `podman machine start` command, when run with `--log-level=debug`, now creates a console window to display the virtual machine while booting.\r\n- Podman now supports a new option, `--imagestore`, which allows images to be stored in a different directory than the graphroot.\r\n- The `--ip-range` option to the `podman network create` command now accepts a new syntax, `<startIP>-<endIP>`, which allows more flexibility when limiting the ip range that Podman assigns.\r\n- [Tech Preview] A new command, `podmansh`, has been added, which executes a user shell within a container when the user logs into the system. The container that the users get added to can be defined via a Podman Quadlet file. This feature is currently a `Tech Preview` which means it's ready for users to try out but changes can be expected in upcoming versions.\r\n- The `podman network create` command supports a new `--option`, `bclim`, for the `macvlan` driver.\r\n- The `podman network create` command now supports adding static routes using the `--route` option.\r\n- The `podman network create` command supports a new `--option`, `no_default_route` for all drivers.\r\n- The `podman info` command now prints network information about the binary path, package version, program version and DNS information ([#18443](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18443)).\r\n- The `podman info` command now displays the number of free locks available, helping to debug lock exhaustion scenarios.\r\n- The `podman info` command now outputs information about pasta, if it exists in helper_binaries_dir or $PATH.\r\n- The remote Podman client\u2019s `podman build` command now accepts Containerfiles that are not in the context directory ([#18239](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18239)).\r\n- The remote Podman client\u2019s `podman play kube` command now supports the `--configmap` option ([#17513](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17513)).\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports multi-doc YAML files for configmap arguments. ([#18537](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18537)).\r\n- The `podman pod create` command now supports a new flag, `--restart`, which sets the restart policy for all the containers in a pod.\r\n- The `--format={{.Restarts}}` option to the `podman ps` command now shows the number of times a container has been restarted based on its restart policy.\r\n- The `--format={{.Restarts}}` option to the `podman pod ps` command now shows the total number of container restarts in a pod.\r\n- The podman machine provider can now be specified via the `CONTAINERS_MACHINE_PROVIDER` environment variable, as well as via the `provider` field in `containers.conf` ([#17116](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17116)).\r\n- A default list of pasta arguments can now be set in `containers.conf` via `pasta_options`.\r\n- The `podman machine init` and `podman machine set` commands now support a new option, `--user-mode-networking`, which improves interops with VPN configs that drop traffic from WSL networking, on Windows.\r\n- The remote Podman client\u2019s `podman push` command now supports the `--digestfile` option ([#18216](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18216)).\r\n- Podman now supports a new option, `--out`, that allows redirection or suppression of STDOUT ([#18120](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18120)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The `podman system service` command now emits a warning when binding to a TCP socket. This is not a secure configuration and the Podman team recommends against using it.\r\n- The `podman top` command no longer depends on ps(1) being present in the container image and now uses the one from the host ([#19001](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19001)).\r\n- The `--filter id=xxx` option will now treat `xxx` as a CID prefix, and not as a regular expression ([#18471](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18471)).\r\n- The `--filter` option now requires multiple `--filter` flags to specify multiple filters. It will no longer support the comma syntax (`--filter label=a,label=b`).\r\n- The `slirp4netns` binary for will now be searched for in paths specified by the `helper_binaries_dir` option in `containers.conf` ([#18239](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18568)).\r\n- Podman machine now updates `/run/docker.sock` within the guest to be consistent with its rootless/rootful setting ([#18480](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18480)).\r\n- The `podman system df` command now counts files which podman generates for use with specific containers as part of the disk space used by those containers, and which can be reclaimed by removing those containers. It also counts space used by files it associates with specific images and volumes as being used by those images and volumes.\r\n- The `podman build` command now returns a clearer error message when the Containerfile cannot be found. ([#16354](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16354)).\r\n- Containers created with `--pid=host` will no longer print errors on podman stop ([#18460](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18460)).\r\n- The `podman manifest push` command no longer requires a destination to be specified. If a destination is not provided, the source is used as the destination ([#18360](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18360)).\r\n- The `podman system reset` command now warns the user that the graphroot and runroot directories will be deleted ([#18349](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18349)), ([#18295](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18295)).\r\n- The `package` and `package-install` targets in Makefile have now been fixed and also renamed to `rpm` and `rpm-install` respectively for clarity ([#18817](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18817)).\r\n\r\n### Quadlet\r\n- Quadlet now exits with a non-zero exit code when errors are found ([#18778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18778)).\r\n- Rootless podman quadlet files can now be installed in `/etc/containers/systemd/users` directory.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `AutoUpdate` option.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Mask` and `Unmask` options.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `WorkingDir` option, which specifies the default working dir in a container.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Sysctl` option, which sets namespaced kernel parameters for containers ([#18727](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18727)).\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `SecurityLabelNetsted=true` option, which allows nested SELinux containers.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `Pull` option in `.container` files ([#18779](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18779)).\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `ExitCode` field in `.kube` files, which reflects the exit codes of failed containers.\r\n- Quadlet now supports `PodmanArgs` field.\r\n- Quadlet now supports the `HostName` field, which sets the container's host name, in `.container` files ([#18486](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18486)).\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command would fail with a 255 exit code. It now waits for systemd-user sessions to be up, and for SSH to be ready, addressing the flaky machine starts ([#17403](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17403)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman auto update` command did not correctly use authentication files when contacting container registries.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `--label` option to the `podman volume ls` command would return volumes that matched any of the filters, not all of them  ([#19219](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19219)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman kube play` command did not recognize containerPort names inside Kubernetes liveness probes. Now, liveness probes support both containerPort names as well as port numbers ([#18645](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18645)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--dns` option to the `podman run` command was ignored for macvlan networks ([#19169](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19169)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman system service` command where setting LISTEN_FDS when listening on TCP would misbehave.\r\n- Fixed a bug where hostnames were not recognized as a network alias.

It now sets the correct working directory pointing to the container bundle directory ([#18907](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18907)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `-device-cgroup-rule` option was silently ignored in rootless mode ([#18698](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18698)).\r\n- Listing images is now more resilient towards concurrently running image removals.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--force` option to the `podman kube down` command would not remove volumes ([#18797](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18797)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where setting the `--list-tags` option in the `podman search` command would cause the command to ignore the `--format` option ([#18939](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18939)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command did not properly translate the proxy IP.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman auto-update` command would not restart dependent units (specified via `Requires=`) on auto update ([#18926](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18926)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman pull` command would print ids multiple times when using additional stores ([#18647](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18647)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where creating a container while setting unmask option to an empty array would cause the create to fail ([#18848](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18848)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the propagation of proxy settings for QEMU VMs was broken.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman rm -fa` command could fail to remove dependency containers such as pod infra containers ([#18180](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18180)).\r\n- Fixed a bug  where ` --tz` option to the `podman create ` and `podman run` commands would not create a proper localtime symlink to the zoneinfo file, which was causing some applications (e.g. java) to not read the timezone correctly.\r\n- Fixed a bug where lowering the ulimit after container creation would cause the container to fail ([#18714](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18714)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where signals were not forwarded correctly in rootless containers ([#16091](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16091)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter volume=` option to the `podman events` command would not display the relevant events ([#18618](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18618)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman wait` command where containers created with the `--restart=always` option would result in the container staying in a stopped state.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command returned an incorrect memory limit after a `container update`. ([#18621](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18621)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman run` command where the `PODMAN_USERNS` environment variable was not ignored when the `--pod` option was set, resulting in a container created in a different user namespace than its pod ([#18580](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18580)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` command would not create the `/run/.containerenv` when the tmpfs is mounted on `/run` ([#18531](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18531)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `$HOME` environment variable would be configured inconsistently between container starts if a new passwd entry had to be created for the container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command would restart initContainers based on the restart policy of the pod. initContainers should never be restarted.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client\u2019s `build` command where an invalid platform would be set.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman history` command did not display tags ([#17763](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17763)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine init` command would create invalid machines when run with certain UIDs ([#17893](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17893)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client\u2019s `podman manifest push` command where an error encountered during the push incorrectly claimed that the error occurred while adding an item to the list.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine rm` command would remove the machine connection before the user confirms the removal of the machine ([#18330](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18330)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the sqlite database backend where the first read access may fail ([#17859](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17859)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where a podman machine could get stuck in the `starting` state ([#16945](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/16945)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where running a container with the `--network=container:` option would fail when the target container uses the host network mode. The same also now works for the other namespace options (`--pid`, `--uts`, `--cgroupns`, `--ipc`) ([#18027](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18027)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format {{.State}}` option to the `podman ps` command would display the status rather than the state ([#18244](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18244)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `podman commit` command where setting a `--message` while also specifying `--format=docker` options would incorrectly warn that setting a message is incompatible with OCI image formats ([#17773](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17773)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `--format` option to the `podman history` command, where the `{{.CreatedAt}}` and `{{.Size}}` fields were inconsistent with Docker\u2019s output ([#17767](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17767)), ([#17768](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17768)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the remote Podman client where filtering containers would not return all matching containers ([#18153](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18153)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat and Libpod Top endpoints for Containers did not correctly report errors.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Pull and Compat Push endpoints where errors were incorrectly handled.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Wait endpoint to correctly handle the \"removed\" condition ([#18889](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18889)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Stats endpoint for Containers where the `online_cpus` field was not set correctly ([#15754](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15754)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Compat Build endpoint where the pull field accepted a boolean value instead of a string ([#17778](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17778)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Compat History endpoint for Images did not prefix the image ID with `sha256:` ([#17762](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17762)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Libpod Export endpoint for Images where exporting to an oci-dir or a docker-dir format would not export to the correct format ([#15897](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15897)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Containers now supports the `platform` parameter ([#18951](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18951)).\r\n- The Compat Remove endpoint for Images now supports the `noprune` query parameter, which ensures that dangling parents of the specified image are not removed\r\n- The Compat Info endpoint now reports running rootless and SELinux enabled as security options.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Auth endpoint where a nil dereference could potentially occur.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- The `podman system service` command is now supported on FreeBSD.\r\n- Updated the Mac pkginstaller QEMU to v8.0.0\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.31.0\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.48.0\r\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.26.1\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.55.2", "created_at": "2023-07-20T22:04:23Z", "project": "Podman", "repo": "containers/libpod", "type": "Container", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.31.1", "tag_name": "v1.31.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.31.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

Packer have not been updated. Plugin releases occur on\n     a regular basis to address issues and feature requests.\n     Please note that in an upcoming version of Packer, we will remove the last\n     bundled plugins from Packer.\n     Users are encouraged to use `packer init` for HCL2 templates or\n     `packer plugins install` with legacy JSON templates for installing external\n     plugins.\n\n* Packer will now warn when using bundled plugins. This feature will be removed in\n    a future version of the tool, so this warning is meant to bring awareness of the\n    upcoming change, and to help users update their environment/templates to be\n    ready for this.\n    [GH-12495](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12495)\n\n### BUG FIXES:\n\n* Fixed a bug with how Packer was discovering plugins: in order to load\n     plugins, Packer would recursively scan all the known directories in which\n     we could have installed plugins. This caused unnecessary directory\n     walks and slowdowns upon invocation. Packer will now only check\n     for nested plugins within the directories used by commands such as `packer\n     init`, or `packer plugins install`, or as defined in PACKER_PLUGIN_PATH.\n     Refer to\n     [Packer's plugin directory documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/configure#packer-s-plugin-directory)\n     for details on how loading works.\n     [GH-12414](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12414)\n\n* The `packer init` subcommand now bundles all the missing installed plugins into one\n    condensed warning, as opposed to one warning per missing plugin.\n    [GH-12506](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12506)\n\n### PLUGINS:\n\n* packer-plugin-parallels: The Parallels plugin has been handed over to the Parallels\n     team. New releases for this plugin are available at\n     https://github.com/parallels/packer-plugin-parallels. This plugin is is no longer\n     being bundled in the Packer binary release. Existing references to the\n     plugin will continue to work but users are advised to update the\n     `required_plugins` block to use the new plugin source address.\n    [GH-12476](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12476)\n    ```\n     required_plugins {\n       parallels = {\n         source  =  \"github.com/parallels/parallels\"\n         version =  \"~> 1\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* The `hcl2_upgrade` subcommand will now add `required_plugins` to the template\n    generated from JSON for all our officially supported plugins.\n    [GH-12504](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/pull/12504)\n\n", "created_at": "2023-07-19T20:13:58Z", "project": "packer", "repo": "hashicorp/packer", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Kubernetes v1.24.16", "tag_name": "v1.24.16", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.24.16", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes", "body": "\nSee [kubernetes-announce@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce).

requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.0.x`.\r\n[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on\r\nErlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimum Supported Erlang Version\r\n\r\nAs of 3.12.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25.

In the `ids` field, multiple IDs\n  can now be specified in a grant, either via commas (text format) or array\n  (JSON format). ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3263)).\n* dev environment: When running `boundary dev` the initial LDAP auth-method with an\n  ID of `amldap_1234567890` is now in a public-active state, so it will be returned\n  in the response from `boundary auth-methods list`\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Grants can now accept more than one ID per grant string (or entry in JSON) via\n  the `ids` parameter. In 0.15.0 the ability to add new grants via the `id`\n  parameter will be removed.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* PKI worker authentication: A worker authentication record can be stored more than once, if it matches the \n  existing record for that worker auth key ID.

(#6895, @saschagrunert)\n\n#### Uncategorized\n - Adds debug log to identify when a relabel was not requested (#6962, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)\n - Fix a bug where network metrics collection is broken with systemd cgroup driver and dropped infra containers.

Backwards compatibility with older OpenTelemetry Collector versions can be achieved through the following flags:\r\n  * `prometheus.query.normalize-calls`: If true, normalizes the \"calls\" metric name. e.g. \"calls_total\".\r\n  * `prometheus.query.normalize-duration`: If true, normalizes the \"duration\" metric name to include the duration units. e.g. \"duration_milliseconds_bucket\".\r\n\r\n#### New Features\r\n* [Cassandra] Add Configuration.Close() to ensure TLS cert watcher is closed ([@kennyaz](https://github.com/kennyaz) in [#4515](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4515))\r\n* Add *.kerberos.disable-fast-negotiation option to Kafka consumer ([@pmuls99](https://github.com/pmuls99) in

([@albertteoh](https://github.com/albertteoh) in [#4555](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4555))\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements\r\n\r\n* Add readme for memstore plugin ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [283bdd9](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/commit/283bdd93cbb4a467842625d8eb320722fcb83494))\r\n* Pass a wrapper instead of `opentracing.Tracer` to ease migration to OTEL in the future [part 1] ([@afzalbin64](https://github.com/afzalbin64) in [#4529](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4529))\r\n* [hotROD] Add OTEL instrumentation to

[#4553](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/4553))\r\n* [Test] Fixed a race condition causing unit test failure by changing the logging  ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in

See [#41113](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41113) for more details. See the upstream Kubernetes [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Docker 23.0 Support\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\nSupport for Docker 23.0 has been added. See [#40731](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40731) for more details. See the upstream Docker [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/23.0/) for a full list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Improved Install Process for Kubernetes v1.25 and Above\r\n\r\nRancher versions 2.7.2 through 2.7.4 require users to set `global.cattle.psp.enabled` to `false` to install on Kubernetes versions 1.25 and above. Rancher will now attempt to detect if a cluster is running a Kubernetes version where PSPs are not supported, and default usage of PSPs to `false` if it can determine that PSPs are not supported in the cluster. Users can still manually override this by explicitly providing `true` or `false` for this value. Rancher will still use PSPs by default in clusters which support PSPs, such as clusters running Kubernetes versions 1.24 or lower.\r\n\r\nIf you install Rancher with PSPs enabled on a cluster which doesn't support PSPs, such as by overriding this value to `true` when installing the chart, you may experience issues when attempting to uninstall Rancher, which can leave resources behind. In these cases, you should run the [Rancher cleanup tool](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cleanup) to remove any left-over artifacts of Rancher, and complete the uninstall process. See [#41455](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41455) for more details.\r\n\r\n### New in Rancher\r\n\r\n<!-- team/mapps -->\r\n- Increased the refresh time to 6 hours when updating the Rancher charts Helm repository. This mitigates timeout errors on git.rancher.io during Rancher releases. See [#40805](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40805).\r\n- You can now select Okta groups from the **Member Roles** dropdown under **Cluster Settings**. See [#38029](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38029) for more details.\r\n- Added customization support for scheduling fields and resource limits for the cluster agent, and for the cluster's Fleet agent. You can use this feature to modify cluster tolerations, affinity rules, and resource requirments. See [#41035](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41035) and the [Rancher documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-server-configuration) (under *Cluster Agent Configuration and Fleet Agent Configuration* for your respective Kubernetes distribution).\r\n\r\n### New in the Rancher UI\r\n\r\n- The Advanced Worker now supports the `management` and `rancher` stores, and  handles socket management and event processing within a Web Worker . See [#8837](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8837).\r\n- You can view a list of resources for projects with a single request by filtering by one or more projects or namespaces. See [#7618](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7618).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Disabled a feature that caused a significant memory increase in both Rancher and downstream clusters. See [#41379](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41379).\r\n<!-- team/area2, area/harvester, area/provisioning-v2 -->\r\n- Fixed an issue where, during an upgrade of RKE2 in a Harvester cluster, the first node would be upgraded while the remaining server nodes' scheduling was disabled. See [#39167](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39167).\r\n<!-- team/area1, area/ingress, area/server-chart -->\r\n- Added the `--set service.type: NodePort` Helm setting. This resolves an issue where clusters that used the default GKE ingress but didn't use VPC-native mode were incompatible with `cattle-system/rancher`. See [#16061](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16061).\r\n- Fixed an issue where, when removing finalizers from a provisioning cluster object, there was a race condition between adding the finalizers back and the generating framework that deletes the generated `rkecluster`, `rkecontrolplane`, `cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io` and `machinedeployment`s. See [#41887](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41887).\r\n<!-- team/area2, team/infracloud -->\r\n- The `v1.24.14+k3s1`, `v1.25.10+k3s1`, and `v1.26.5+k3s1` K3s versions added in Rancher v2.7.5 fix an issue where Ingress wasn't working on certain K3s clusters following an upgrade. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/7586#issuecomment-1555414626) for earlier Kubernetes versions. See [#41582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41582). \r\n\r\n# Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- team/area1 -->\r\n- Rancher now installs the same pinned version of the rancher-webhook chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Note that restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions ideally need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n- The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n- After upgrading to Rancher v2.7.5, LDAP-based login using Active Directory integration fails due a change in the LDAP search scope. See [#42122](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42122).\r\n- After upgrading to Rancher v2.7.5, a migration is performed due to the LDAP search scope update. During the migration, logging in with a user that hasn't been migrated yet will create a duplicate user. The initial login succeeds, but the user won't have the expected permissions and subsequent logins will fail due to duplicates of the user existing. See [#42120](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42120).\r\n- When you try to upgrade an RKE1 v1.22 cluster on Rancher v2.7.2 or above, the upgrade fails with a \"failure to validate\" cluster error. See [#42127](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42127).\r\n- When you try to provision an RKE2 node with a custom Docker machine driver and already have multiple Rancher replicas running, the provisioning job will fail, as it can not find the driver in `/assets`. See [#42128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42128).\r\n- Attempting to delete a master node breaks the ectd configuration on the former master node. Endpoints won't update correctly and the leader election process will fail. This breaks the Cluster API. See [#42121](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42121).\r\n- Fleet periodically deletes certain Kubernetes resources in bundles. Bundle IDs are trimmed to fit within the Helm release name length (53 chars) using the `<trimmed-release-name>-<6-char-hash>` format. When the 47th character of the original release name is already a dash (`-`), the generated release name will contain a double dash. This leads to discrepancies between the actual deployed release name, and the one expected by Fleet to be deployed. Fleet deletes and redeploys the corresponding bundle. See [#1660](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1660).\t\r\n- The relationship between a given Rancher version and a given Fleet version is currently not defined, which may lead to inconsistent versions of Fleet being installed during  Rancher upgrades. See [#1590](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1590).\r\n- Fleet is creating a large number of orphaned resources, which are then stored in etcd. This increased load on etcd is leading to timeouts. See [#1656](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1656).\r\n- During an RKE2 snapshot restore of a custom cluster, Rancher might delete nodes from the cluster. <!-- SURE-6669 -->\r\n- When you edit RKE1 clusters with defined Cluster agent or Fleet agent configurations, removing these values and adding new ones to the same section results in the new values not being saved. Editing the cluster and setting the new values again will correctly apply the change. See [#9003](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9003).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n<!-- dashboard, team/area2 -->\r\n- The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n<!-- team/rke2 -->\r\n- When you upgrade a Windows RKE2 cluster, the upgrade gets stuck on the Windows node and is unable to complete. Some logs indicate that RKE2 is unable to restart because the process is currently being used. See [#41868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41868).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter (such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later), upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0, which supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command, to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and related issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the privileged flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n- The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s now respects the `managedBy` annotation. Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround in its initial release to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false` since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n- Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n- Privilege escalation is now disabled by default when creating deployments. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n- Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n  - Rancher now aggregates the changed counts and only send a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n  - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, causing significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n- When provisioning downstream clusters, the cluster name must now conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n- In previous versions, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. A configurable priorityClass has been added to the Rancher pod and its feature charts. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n- Rancher now defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging, instead of Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n- Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type Application. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some  necessary actions within Azure AD. This will cause errors.\r\n- Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters. The default behavior has been changed, so that if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.7.5\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.7.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.4.6](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.4.6)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.26.4 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.9\r\n- v1.24.13\r\n- v1.23.16\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.26.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.25.10\r\n- v1.24.14\r\n- v1.23.17\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- Dual-stack and IPv6-only support for RKE1 clusters using the Flannel CNI will be experimental starting in v1.23.x. See the [upstream Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/). Dual-stack is not currently supported on Windows. See [#165](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/165).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\n- Microsoft has deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. A configuration update is necessary to make sure users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the docs](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n### Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features were announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global) - Apps within Multicluster Apps section\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Major Issues\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - Starting with Rancher v2.7.2, a webhook will now be installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher >= v2.7.2 to a version < v2.7.2, you'll experience an issue where the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after Rancher version < v2.7.2 is running) to remove the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE and RKE2:**\r\n    - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n  - **RKE2:**\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - When provisioning using an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - The communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n    - The `system-upgrade-controller` Deployment may fail after Monitoring is enabled on an RKE2 v1.23 or v1.24 cluster with Windows nodes. See [#38646](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38646).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Windows:**\r\n    - CSI Proxy for Windows will now work in an air-gapped environment.\r\n    - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n    - When upgrading Windows nodes in RKE2 clusters via the Rancher UI, Windows worker nodes will require a reboot after the upgrade is completed. See [#37645](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37645).\r\n    - The `fleet-agent` pod fails to deploy on an upgraded RKE2 Windows Custom cluster. See [#993](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/993).\r\n  - **RKE2 and K3s:**\r\n    - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).\r\n    - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n        - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n        - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n  - **K3s:**\r\n    - Clusters are in an `Updating` state even when it contains nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020029) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/helm-charts-in-rancher#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n    - If you have downstream private GKE clusters, you might experience issues when interacting with the resources that the webhook validates, such as namespaces. This can cause problems with activities where Rancher needs to interact with those resources, such as when you install charts. As a [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142#issuecomment-1505624756), add a firewall setting to allow traffic to the webhook. See [#41142](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41142).\r\n  - **EKS:**\r\n    - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. To see more detail about this issue and the workaround, please see this [comment](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392#issue-1421180024).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Authentication:**\r\n    - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after configuring another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup annotation with the unlocked value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:**\r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio Versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes 1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes 1.23 until the next charts' release.\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n    - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Docker Installations:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n  - Rancher single node wont start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or newer. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. During an upgrade, this is a benign error and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - - When enabling some custom node drivers, the Cloud Credential creation page does not show the correct default fields and has an uneditable foo key. See [#8563](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8563).\r\n  - You need to force-refresh the Rancher UI after initial Rancher setup, to trigger the prompt to accept the self-signed certificate. As a workaround, visit the Rancher portal, accept the self-signed certificate, and go through the setup process. Once done, go to the address bar of your browser and click the lock icon. Select the option to allow you to receive certificate errors for the Rancher website. You'll then be prompted again to accept the new certificate. See [#7867](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7867).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n  - In some instances under Users and Authentication, no users are listed and clicking Create to create a new user does not display the entire form. To work around this when encountered, perform a hard refresh to be able to log back in. See [#37531](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37531).\r\n  - Deployment securityContext section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy Support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).\r\n  - Remove legacy feature multi-cluster app. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt.

We are also introducing a new way to select tablet type preference which should eventually replace the `in_order:` hint currently used as a prefix for tablet types. The signature for creating a new `TabletPicker` now looks like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewTabletPicker(\r\n\tctx context.Context,\r\n\tts *topo.Server,\r\n\tcells []string,\r\n\tlocalCell, keyspace, shard, tabletTypesStr string,\r\n\toptions TabletPickerOptions,\r\n) (*TabletPicker, error) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere ctx, localCell, option are all new parameters.\r\n\r\n`option` is of type `TabletPickerOptions` and includes two fields, `CellPreference` and `TabletOrder`.\r\n- `CellPreference`: \"PreferLocalWithAlias\" (default) gives preference to vtgate's local cell, or \"OnlySpecified\" which only picks from the cells explicitly passed in by the client\r\n- `TabletOrder`: \"Any\" (default) for no ordering or random, or \"InOrder\" to use the order specified by the client\r\n\r\nSee [PR 12282 Description](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12282) for examples on how this changes cell picking behavior.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgr-default-tls-version\"/>Default TLS version changed for `vtgr`\r\n\r\nWhen using TLS with `vtgr`, we now default to TLS 1.2 if no other explicit version is configured. Configuration flags are provided to explicitly configure the minimum TLS version to be used.\r\n\r\n`vtgr` is now deprecated as part of `v17.0.0`, please see [the deprecation notice](#deprecated-vtgr).\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"dedicated-vtgate-prepare-stats\">Dedicated stats for VTGate Prepare operations\r\n\r\nPrior to v17 Vitess incorrectly combined stats for VTGate `Execute` and `Prepare` operations under a single stats key (`Execute`). In v17 `Execute` and `Prepare` operations generate stats under independent stats keys.\r\n\r\nHere is a (condensed) example of stats output:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"VtgateApi\": {\r\n    \"Histograms\": {\r\n      \"Execute.src.primary\": {\r\n        \"500000\": 5\r\n      },\r\n      \"Prepare.src.primary\": {\r\n        \"100000000\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"VtgateApiErrorCounts\": {\r\n    \"Execute.src.primary.INVALID_ARGUMENT\": 3,\r\n    \"Execute.src.primary.ALREADY_EXISTS\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"migrated-vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin web migrated to vite\r\n\r\nPreviously, VTAdmin web used the Create React App framework to test, build, and serve the application. In v17, Create React App has been removed, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used in its place. Some of the main changes include:\r\n- Vite uses `VITE_*` environment variables instead of `REACT_APP_*` environment variables\r\n- Vite uses `import.meta.env` in place of `process.env`\r\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is used in place of Jest for testing\r\n- Our protobufjs generator now produces an es6 module instead of commonjs to better work with Vite's defaults\r\n- `public/index.html` has been moved to root directory in web/vtadmin\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"keyspace-name-validation\">Keyspace name validation in TopoServer\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, it was possible to create a keyspace with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations.\r\n\r\nKeyspace names are restricted to using only ASCII characters, digits and `_` and `-`. TopoServer's `GetKeyspace` and `CreateKeyspace` methods return an error if given an invalid name.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"shard-name-validation\">Shard name validation in TopoServer\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, it was possible to create a shard name with invalid characters, which would then be inaccessible to various cluster management operations.\r\n\r\nShard names are restricted to using only ASCII characters, digits and `_` and `-`. TopoServer's `GetShard` and `CreateShard` methods return an error if given an invalid name.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"remove-compression-flags-from-vtctld-binaries\">Compression CLI flags remove from vtctld and vtctldclient binaries\r\n\r\nThe CLI flags below were mistakenly added to `vtctld` and `vtctldclient` in v15. In v17, they are no longer present in those binaries.\r\n\r\n * `--compression-engine-name`\r\n * `--compression-level`\r\n * `--external-compressor`\r\n * `--external-compressor-extension`\r\n * `--external-decompressor`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"VtctldClient-RestoreFromBackup\">VtctldClient command RestoreFromBackup will now use the correct context\r\n\r\nThe VtctldClient command `RestoreFromBackup` initiates an asynchronous process on the specified tablet to restore data from either the latest backup or the closest one before the specified backup-timestamp.\r\nPrior to v17, this asynchronous process could run indefinitely in the background since it was called using the background context. In v17 [PR#12830](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12830),\r\nthis behavior was changed to use a context with a timeout of `action_timeout`. If you are using VtctldClient to initiate a restore, make sure you provide an appropriate value for action_timeout to give enough\r\ntime for the restore process to complete. Otherwise, the restore will throw an error if the context expires before it completes.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-restore-metrics\">VTTablet Restore Metrics\r\n\r\nAs part of the VTTablet Sidecar Schema Maintenance Refactor in v16.0.0, we dropped the `local_metadata` table from the sidecar database schema. This table was storing a couple of metrics related to restores from backup.\r\nThey have now been re-introduced as metrics that can be accessed from `/debug/vars`.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"Vttablet-TxThrottler\">Vttablet's transaction throttler now also throttles DML outside of `BEGIN; ...; COMMIT;` blocks\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, `vttablet`'s transaction throttler (enabled with `--enable-tx-throttler`) would only throttle requests done inside an explicit transaction, i.e., a `BEGIN; ...; COMMIT;` block.\r\nIn v17 [PR#13040](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13037), this behavior was being changed so that it also throttles work outside of explicit transactions for `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/LOAD` queries.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-flag\"/>New command line flags and behavior\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"builtin-backup-read-buffering-flags\"/>Backup --builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size and --builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size\r\n\r\nPrior to v17 the builtin Backup Engine does not use read buffering for restores, and for backups uses a hardcoded write buffer size of `2097152 bytes`.\r\n\r\nIn v17 these defaults may be tuned with, respectively `--builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size` and `--builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size`.\r\n\r\n- `--builtinbackup-file-read-buffer-size`:  read files using an IO buffer of this many bytes. Golang defaults are used when set to `0`.\r\n- `--builtinbackup-file-write-buffer-size`: write files using an IO buffer of this many bytes. Golang defaults are used when set to `0`. (default `2097152`)\r\n\r\nThese flags are applicable to the following programs:\r\n\r\n- `vtbackup`\r\n- `vtctld`\r\n- `vttablet`\r\n- `vttestserver`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"manifest-backup-external-decompressor-command\" />Manifest backup external decompressor command\r\n\r\nAdd a new builtin/xtrabackup flag `--manifest-external-decompressor`. When set the value of that flag is stored in the manifest field `ExternalDecompressor`. This manifest field may be consulted when decompressing a backup that was compressed with an external command.\r\n\r\nThis feature enables the following flow:\r\n\r\n 1. Take a backup using an external compressor\r\n    ```\r\n     Backup --compression-engine=external \\\r\n            --external-compressor=zstd \\\r\n            --manifest-external-decompressor=\"zstd -d\"\r\n    ```\r\n 2. Restore that backup with a mere `Restore` command, without having to specify `--external-decompressor`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"throttler-config-via-topo\" />vttablet --throttler-config-via-topo\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in v16 and defaulted to `false`. In v17 it defaults to `true`, and there is no need to supply it.\r\n\r\nNote that this flag overrides `--enable-lag-throttler` and `--throttle-threshold`, which now give warnings, and will be removed in v18.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New stats\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"detailed-backup-and-restore-stats\"/>Detailed backup and restore stats\r\n\r\n##### Backup metrics\r\n\r\nMetrics related to backup operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet.\r\n\r\n- `BackupBytes`\r\n- `BackupCount`\r\n- `BackupDurationNanosecond`\r\n\r\nDepending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a backup may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Reading files from disk.\r\n* Compressing files.\r\n* Uploading compress files to cloud object storage.\r\n\r\nThese operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.\r\n\r\n##### Restore metrics\r\n\r\nMetrics related to restore operations are available in both Vtbackup and VTTablet:\r\n\r\n- `RestoreBytes`\r\n- `RestoreCount`\r\n- `RestoreDurationNanoseconds`\r\n\r\nDepending on the Backup Engine and Backup Storage in-use, a restore may be a complex pipeline of operations, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Downloading compressed files from cloud object storage.\r\n* Decompressing files.\r\n* Writing decompressed files to disk.\r\n\r\nThese operations are counted and timed, and the number of bytes consumed or produced by each stage of the pipeline are counted as well.\r\n\r\n##### Vtbackup metrics\r\n\r\nVtbackup exports some metrics which are not available elsewhere:\r\n\r\n- `DurationByPhaseSeconds`\r\n\r\nVtbackup fetches the last backup, restores it to an empty mysql installation, replicates recent changes into that installation, and then takes a backup of that installation.\r\n\r\n`DurationByPhaseSeconds` exports timings for these individual phases.\r\n\r\n##### Example\r\n\r\n**A snippet of vtbackup metrics after running it against the local example after creating the initial cluster**\r\n\r\n(Processed with `jq` for readability.)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n

6\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome notes to help understand these metrics:\r\n\r\n* `BackupBytes[\"BackupStorage.File.File:Write\"]` measures how many bytes were read from disk by the `file` Backup Storage implementation during the backup phase.\r\n* `DurationByPhaseSeconds[\"CatchUpReplication\"]` measures how long it took to catch-up replication after the restore phase.\r\n* `DurationByPhaseSeconds[\"RestoreLastBackup\"]` measures to the duration of the restore phase.\r\n* `RestoreDurationNanoseconds[\"-.-.Restore\"]` also measures to the duration of the restore phase.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-error-count-with-code\"/>VTTablet error count with error code\r\n\r\n##### VTTablet Error Count\r\n\r\nWe are introducing new error counter `QueryErrorCountsWithCode` for VTTablet. It is similar to existing [QueryErrorCounts](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vttablet/tabletserver/query_engine.go#L174) except it contains errorCode as additional dimension.\r\nWe will deprecate `QueryErrorCounts` in v18.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vreplication-stream-status-for-prometheus\"/>VReplication stream status for Prometheus\r\n\r\nVReplication publishes the `VReplicationStreamState` status which reports the state of VReplication streams. For example, here's what it looks like in the local cluster example after the MoveTables step:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"VReplicationStreamState\": {\r\n  \"commerce2customer.1\": \"Running\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to v17, this data was not available via the Prometheus backend. In v17, workflow states are also published as a Prometheus gauge with a `state` label and a value of `1.0`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# HELP vttablet_v_replication_stream_state State of vreplication workflow\r\n# TYPE vttablet_v_replication_stream_state gauge\r\nvttablet_v_replication_stream_state{counts=\"1\",state=\"Running\",workflow=\"commerce2customer\"} 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet\"/>VTTablet\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-initialization\"/>Initializing all replicas with super_read_only\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent SUPER privileged users like `root` or `vt_dba` from producing errant GTIDs on replicas, all the replica MySQL servers are initialized with the MySQL\r\nglobal variable `super_read_only` value set to `ON`. During failovers, we set `super_read_only` to `OFF` for the promoted primary tablet. This will allow the\r\nprimary to accept writes. All of the shard's tablets, except the current primary, will still have their global variable `super_read_only` set to `ON`. This will make sure that apart from\r\nMySQL replication no other component, offline system or operator can write directly to a replica.\r\n\r\nReference PR for this change is [PR #12206](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12206)\r\n\r\nAn important note regarding this change is how the default `init_db.sql` file has changed.\r\nThis is even more important if you are running Vitess on the vitess-operator.\r\nYou must ensure your `init_db.sql` is up-to-date with the new default for `v17.0.0`.\r\nThe default file can be found in `./config/init_db.sql`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-schema-reload-timeout\"/>Vttablet Schema Reload Timeout\r\n\r\nA new flag, `--schema-change-reload-timeout` has been added to timeout the reload of the schema that Vttablet does periodically. This is required because sometimes this operation can get stuck after MySQL restarts, etc. More details available in the issue https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13001.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"settings-pool\"/>Settings Pool\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in v15 and it enables pooling the connection with modified connection settings.\r\nTo know more what it does read the [v15 release notes](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v15.0.0) or the [blog](https://vitess.io/blog/2023-03-27-connection-pooling-in-vitess/) or [docs](https://vitess.io/docs/17.0/reference/query-serving/reserved-conn/)\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"online-ddl\"/>Online DDL\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"online-ddl-cut-over-threshold-flag\" />--cut-over-threshold DDL strategy flag\r\n\r\nOnline DDL's strategy now accepts `--cut-over-threshold` (type: `duration`) flag.\r\n\r\nThis flag stand for the timeout in a `vitess` migration's cut-over phase, which includes the final locking of tables before finalizing the migration.\r\n\r\nThe value of the cut-over threshold should be high enough to support the async nature of vreplication catchup phase, as well as accommodate some replication lag. But it mustn't be too high. While cutting over, the migrated table is being locked, causing app connection and query pileup, consuming query buffers, and holding internal mutexes.\r\n\r\nRecommended range for this variable is `5s` - `30s`. Default: `10s`.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"noblob\"/>Support for the `noblob` binlog row image mode \r\n\r\nThe `noblob` binlog row image is now supported by the MoveTables and Reshard VReplication workflows. If the source \r\nor target database has this mode, other workflows like OnlineDDL, Materialize and CreateLookupVindex will error out.\r\nThe row events streamed by the VStream API, where blobs and text columns have not changed, will contain null values \r\nfor those columns, indicated by a `length:-1`.\r\n\r\nReference PR for this change is [PR #12905](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12905)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"binlog-compression\"/>Support for MySQL 8.0 binary log transaction compression\r\n\r\nMySQL 8.0 added support for [binary log compression via transaction (GTID) compression in 8.0.20](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysql-8-0-20-replication-enhancements/).\r\nYou can read more about this feature here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log-transaction-compression.html\r\n\r\nThis can \u2014 at the cost of increased CPU usage \u2014 dramatically reduce the amount of data sent over the wire for MySQL replication while also dramatically reducing the overall\r\nstorage space needed to retain binary logs (for replication, backup and recovery, CDC, etc). For larger installations this was a very desirable feature and while you could\r\ntechnically use it with Vitess (the MySQL replica-sets making up each shard could use it fine) there was one very big limitation \u2014 [VReplication workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vreplication/)\r\nwould not work. Given the criticality of VReplication workflows within Vitess, this meant that in practice this MySQL feature was not usable within Vitess clusters.\r\n\r\nWe have addressed this issue in [PR #12950](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12950) by adding support for processing the compressed transaction events in VReplication,\r\nwithout any (known) limitations.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtgate\"/>VTGate\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"stream-execute\"/>Modified StreamExecute GRPC API\r\n\r\nEarlier VTGate grpc api for `StreamExecute` did not return the session in the response.\r\nEven though the underlying implementation supported transactions and other features that requires session persistence.\r\nWith [PR #13131](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/13131) VTGate will return the session to the client\r\nso that it can be persisted with the client and sent back to VTGate on the next api call.\r\n\r\nThis does not impact anyone using the mysql client library to connect to VTGate.\r\nThis could be a breaking change for grpc api users based on how they have implemented their grpc clients.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"insert-planner\"/> Insert Planning with Gen4\r\n\r\nGen4 planner was made default in v14 for `SELECT` queries. In v15 `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries were moved to Gen4 framework.\r\nWith this release `INSERT` queries are moved to Gen4.\r\n\r\nClients can move to old v3 planner for inserts by using `V3Insert` planner version with `--planner-version` vtgate flag or with comment directive /*vt+ planner=<planner_version>` for individual query.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecations-and-deletions\"/>Deprecations and Deletions\r\n\r\n- The deprecated `automation` and `automationservice` protobuf definitions and associated client and server packages have been removed.\r\n- Auto-population of DDL revert actions and tables at execution-time has been removed. This is now handled entirely at enqueue-time.\r\n- Backwards-compatibility for failed migrations without a `completed_timestamp` has been removed (see https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/8499).\r\n- The deprecated `Key`, `Name`, `Up`, and `TabletExternallyReparentedTimestamp` fields were removed from the JSON representation of `TabletHealth` structures.\r\n- The `MYSQL_FLAVOR` environment variable is no longer used.\r\n- The `--enable-query-plan-field-caching`/`--enable_query_plan_field_caching` vttablet flag was deprecated in v15 and has now been removed.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-flags\"/>Deprecated Command Line Flags\r\n\r\n- Flag `vtctld_addr` has been deprecated and will be deleted in a future release. This affects `vtgate`, `vttablet` and `vtcombo`.\r\n- The flag `schema_change_check_interval` used to accept either a Go duration value (e.g. `1m` or `30s`) or a bare integer, which was treated as seconds.\r\n  This behavior was deprecated in v15.0.0 and has been removed.\r\n  `schema_change_check_interval` now **only** accepts Go duration values. This affects `vtctld`.\r\n- The flag `durability_policy` is no longer used by vtctld. Instead it reads the durability policies for all keyspaces from the topology server.\r\n- The flag `use_super_read_only` is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. This affects `vttablet`.\r\n- The flag `queryserver-config-schema-change-signal-interval` is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. This affects `vttablet`.\r\n  Schema-tracking has been refactored in this release to not use polling anymore, therefore the signal interval isn't required anymore.\r\n\r\nIn `vttablet` various flags that took float values as seconds have updated to take the standard duration syntax as well.\r\nFloat-style parsing is now deprecated and will be removed in a later release.\r\nFor example, instead of `--queryserver-config-query-pool-timeout 12.2`, use `--queryserver-config-query-pool-timeout 12s200ms`.\r\nAffected flags and YAML config keys:\r\n\r\n- `degraded_threshold`\r\n- `heartbeat_interval`\r\n- `heartbeat_on_demand_duration`\r\n- `health_check_interval`\r\n- `queryserver-config-idle-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-pool-conn-max-lifetime`\r\n- `queryserver-config-olap-transaction-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-query-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-query-pool-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-schema-reload-time`\r\n- `queryserver-config-schema-change-signal-interval`\r\n- `queryserver-config-stream-pool-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-stream-pool-idle-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-transaction-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-txpool-timeout`\r\n- `queryserver-config-txpool-idle-timeout`\r\n- `shutdown_grace_period`\r\n- `unhealthy_threshold`\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-stats\"/>Deprecated Stats\r\n\r\nThese stats are deprecated in v17.\r\n\r\n| Deprecated stat | Supported alternatives |\r\n|-|-|\r\n| `backup_duration_seconds` | `BackupDurationNanoseconds` |\r\n| `restore_duration_seconds` | `RestoreDurationNanoseconds` |\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"deprecated-vtgr\"/>Deprecated `vtgr`\r\n\r\nThe `vtgr` component has been deprecated, also see https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/13300.

If necessary, a specific version of the SDK can be downloaded for cases when the project has yet to upgrade to a later or latest version. ([#6443](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6443))\n- Currently, the operator SDK for the Ansible operator lacks options to customize the leader election resource lock behavior. This limits the flexibility of the operator and prevents users from adjusting lease duration and renew deadline according to their specific needs.\nChanges: Implemented enhancements to the operator SDK to include additional flags for configuring leader election resource lock options. These changes provide users with the ability to specify the type of resource object used for locking during leader election and customize the lease duration and renew deadline.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-lease-duration flag to allow users to define the duration that non-leader candidates will wait to force acquire leadership. The default duration is set to 15 seconds.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-renew-deadline flag, enabling users to set the renew deadline, which determines the duration that the acting control plane will retry refreshing leadership before giving up. The default duration is set to 10 seconds.\nIntroduced --leader-elect-resource-lock flag to allow users to define the type of resource object that is used for locking during leader election. Supported options are 'leases', 'endpointsleases', and 'configmapsleases'. The default option is 'leases'.\nThese changes provide more flexibility and control over leader election behavior, allowing operators to adapt to various deployment scenarios and specific requirements. ([#6426](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6426))\n\n### Changes\n\n- Currently, when setting `overrideValues` in your `watches.yaml`, every entry is logged with its key and its value. When working with confidential information such as credentials, logging those information would not be optimal nor desirable. Therefore, there should be a way to silence/suppress these values.\nThis feature introduces the `--suppress-override-values` boolean-flag for the `helm-operator`. When set to true, the value of the overrideValues entry is sanitized with this value \"****\".\nThis is a simple example of `overrideValues` of the `watches.yaml` ```yaml overrideValues:\n  x: y\n```\nThe default-value of `--suppress-override-values` is `false` so therefore we would get this warning logged: `Chart value x overridden to y by operator's watches.yaml`\nWhen setting `--suppress-override-values` `true` the warning will be logged in the following manner: `Chart value x overridden to **** by operator's watches.yaml`. ([#6469](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6469))\n- (images): Bumps all Operator SDK maintained images to now use ubi(-minimal) tag 8.8. ([#6466](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/6466))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- In `run bundle-upgrade`, hash the cache directory name to avoid error of too long file name.

Problem arises because the same underlying field is referenced by\nall the view references created for that field.\n\nFor a query like this one:\nWITH  cte AS (SELECT\n              (SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1),\n               COUNT(dt.f2),\n               dt.f3\n              FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) AS dt)\nSELECT * FROM cte;\n\nit gets transformed into\n\nselect `derived_2_6`.`COUNT(f1)` AS `(SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM t1)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`COUNT(dt.f2)` AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n       `derived_2_5`.`Name_exp_1` AS `f3`\nfrom (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f2`) AS `COUNT(dt.f2)`,\n            `test`.`t1`.`f3` AS `Name_exp_1`\n      from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_5`\nleft join (select count(`test`.`t1`.`f1`) AS `COUNT(f1)`\n           from `test`.`t1`) `derived_2_6` on(true) where true;\n\nThe expression \"Name_exp_1\" is a view reference because the derived\ntable \"dt\" gets merged. When this is replaced with an \"Item_field\"\nduring subquery to derived transformation, we do not increment the\nreference count. Later, we see that the derived table \"cte\" which\nis resolved after the creation of the derived tables \"derived_2_5\"\nand \"derived_2_6\" gets merged. While deleting the un-used fields for\nthis derived table, we delete the field \"f3\" even though it is still\nused in the query.\n\nFix is to correctly increment the ref count for the new field created.\n\nChange-Id: I4035d86990e3cfb099144b7f304b864eb0451f5d", "created_at": "2023-06-22T07:34:44Z", "project": "Mysql", "repo": "mysql/mysql-server", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.21.4.2", "tag_name": "v1.21.4.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/openresty/openresty/releases/tag/v1.21.4.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/openresty/openresty", "body": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21T13:19:59Z", "project": "Openresty", "repo": "openresty/openresty", "type": "Proxy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Tekton Pipeline release v0.49.0 \"Maine Coon Megatron\"", "tag_name": "v0.49.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.49.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline", "body": "<!-- For major releases, add a tag line\r\n# \ud83c\udf89 [Tag Line - to be done] \ud83c\udf89\r\n-->\r\n\r\n-[Docs @ v0.49.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.49.0/docs)\r\n-[Examples @ v0.49.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/v0.49.0/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation one-liner\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.49.0/release.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Attestation\r\n\r\nThe Rekor UUID for this release is `24296fb24b8ad77a7568df3bfec7071c4ec0e2ce4f105b7e8f5749bdad0b5c1774ae7000ce62ac8f`\r\n\r\nObtain the attestation:\r\n```shell\r\nREKOR_UUID=24296fb24b8ad77a7568df3bfec7071c4ec0e2ce4f105b7e8f5749bdad0b5c1774ae7000ce62ac8f\r\nrekor-cli get --uuid $REKOR_UUID --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq .\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerify that all container images in the attestation are in the release file:\r\n```shell\r\nRELEASE_FILE=https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.49.0/release.yaml\r\nREKOR_UUID=24296fb24b8ad77a7568df3bfec7071c4ec0e2ce4f105b7e8f5749bdad0b5c1774ae7000ce62ac8f\r\n\r\n# Obtains the list of images with sha from the attestation\r\nREKOR_ATTESTATION_IMAGES=$(rekor-cli get --uuid \"$REKOR_UUID\" --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq -r '.subject[]|.name + \":v0.49.0@sha256:\" + .digest.sha256')\r\n\r\n# Download the release file\r\ncurl \"$RELEASE_FILE\" > release.yaml\r\n\r\n# For each image in the attestation, match it to the release file\r\nfor image in $REKOR_ATTESTATION_IMAGES; do\r\n  printf $image; grep -q $image release.yaml && echo \" ===> ok\" || echo \" ===> no match\";\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Any special upgrade notice\r\n## Upgrade Notices\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: [TEP-0091] support remote v1 pipeline verification (#6765)\r\n\r\nTrusted Resources supports v1 remote tasks verification\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: [TEP-0091] support remote v1 task verification (#6764)\r\n\r\nTrusted Resources supports v1 remote tasks verification\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: [TEP-0091] update taskrun and pipelinerun condition based on VerificationResult (#6757)\r\n\r\nTrustedResourcesVerified is added to TaskRun/PipelineRun status if trusted resources is enabled, the condition indicates the result of the verification.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: add taskrun gauge metrics for k8s throttling because of defined resource quotas or k8s node constraints (#6744)\r\n\r\nA new gauge metric for both PipelineRun and TaskRun will indicate whether underlying Pods are being throttled by Kubernetes because of either ResourceQuota policies defined in the namespace, or because the underlying node is experiencing resource constraints.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Add more secure SecurityContext to injected pod containers (#6515)\r\n\r\nSet new feature flag \"set-security-context\" to \"true\" to allow TaskRuns and PipelineRuns to be run in namespaces with restricted pod security admission\r\n\r\n# Backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\nIn current release:\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light:  Enable beta features by default (#6732)\r\n\r\naction required: \"enable-api-fields\" is set to \"beta\" by default.

This makes it easier to determine from access and audit logs which actions are performed by the system, and which are performed by an administrative user.\r\n* Bump golang:alpine image version [(#7619)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7619)\r\n* Make LB image configurable when compiling k3s [(#7626)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7626)\r\n* Bump vagrant libvirt with fix for plugin installs [(#7605)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7605)\r\n* Add format command on Makefile [(#7437)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7437)\r\n* Use el8 rpm for fedora 38 and 39 [(#7664)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7664)\r\n* Check variant before version to decide rpm target and packager closes #7666 [(#7667)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7667)\r\n* Test Coverage Reports for E2E tests [(#7526)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7526)\r\n* Soft-fail on node password verification if the secret cannot be created [(#7655)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7655)\r\n  * K3s now allows nodes to join the cluster even if the node password secret cannot be created at the time the node joins. The secret create will be retried in the background. This resolves a potential deadlock created by fail-closed validating webhooks that block secret creation, where the webhook is unavailable until new nodes join the cluster to run the webhook pod.\r\n* Enable containerd aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins [(#7661)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7661)\r\n  * The bundled containerd's aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins have been restored.

Filters can indicate whether the direct IP should be used or whether a reported IP from `PROXY` or `X-Forwarded-For` should be used instead. If the latter, Contour's `numTrustedHops` setting will be respected when determining the source IP. Filters defined at the VirtualHost level apply to all routes, unless overridden by a route-specific filter.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n- [HTTPProxy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.HTTPProxy)\r\n- [IPFilterPolicy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.IPFilterPolicy)\r\n- [Envoy RBAC filter documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/rbac/v3/rbac.proto)\r\n\r\n(#5008, @ecordell)\r\n\r\n## Add Tracing Support\r\n\r\nContour now supports exporting tracing data to [OpenTelemetry][1]\r\n\r\nThe Contour configuration file and ContourConfiguration CRD will be extended with a new optional `tracing` section. This configuration block, if present, will enable tracing and will define the trace properties needed to generate and export trace data.\r\n\r\n### Contour supports the following configurations\r\n- Custom service name, the default is `contour`.\r\n- Custom sampling rate, the default is `100`.\r\n- Custom the maximum length of the request path, the default is `256`.\r\n- Customize span tags from literal and request headers.\r\n- Customize whether to include the pod's hostname and namespace.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://opentelemetry.io/\r\n\r\n(#5043, @yangyy93)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n\r\n## Add support for Global External Authorization for HTTPProxy.\r\n\r\nContour now supports external authorization for all hosts by setting the config as part of the `contourConfig` like so: \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nglobalExtAuth:\r\n  extensionService: projectcontour-auth/htpasswd\r\n  failOpen: false\r\n  authPolicy:\r\n    context:\r\n      header1: value1\r\n      header2: value2\r\n  responseTimeout: 1s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndividual hosts can also override or opt out of this global configuration. \r\nYou can read more about this feature in detail in the [guide](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.25/guides/external-authorization/#global-external-authorization).\r\n\r\n(#4994, @clayton-gonsalves)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: Add support for exact path match condition\r\n\r\nHttpProxy conditions block now also supports exact path match condition.\r\n\r\n(#5000, @arjunsalyan)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: Internal Redirect support\r\n\r\nContour now supports specifying an `internalRedirectPolicy` on a `Route` to handle 3xx redirects internally, that is capturing a configurable 3xx redirect response, synthesizing a new request, sending it to the upstream specified by the new route match, and returning the redirected response as the response to the original request.\r\n\r\n(#5010, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy: implement HTTP query parameter matching\r\n\r\nContour now implements HTTP query parameter matching for HTTPProxy resource-based routes. It supports `Exact`, `Prefix`, `Suffix`, `Regex` and `Contains` string matching conditions together with the `IgnoreCase` modifier and also the `Present` matching condition. For example, the following HTTPProxy will route requests based on the configured condition examples for the given query parameter `search`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: httpproxy-queryparam-matching\r\nspec:\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=example' as is\r\n          name: search\r\n          exact: example\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s1\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=prefixthis' or any string value prefixed by `prefix` (case insensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          prefix: PreFix\r\n          ignoreCase: true\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s2\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=thispostfix' or any string value suffixed by `postfix` (case sensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          suffix: postfix\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s3\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=regularexp123' or any string value matching the given regular expression\r\n          name: search\r\n          regex: ^regular.*\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s4\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=somethinginsideanother' or any string value containing the substring 'inside' (case sensitive)\r\n          name: search\r\n          contains: inside\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s5\r\n          port: 80\r\n    - conditions:\r\n      - queryParam:\r\n          # will match e.g. '?search=' or any string value given to the named parameter\r\n          name: search\r\n          present: true\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: s6\r\n          port: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#5036, @relu)\r\n\r\n## Allow Disabling Features\r\n\r\nThe `contour serve` command takes a new optional flag, `--disable-feature`, that allows disabling certain features.\r\n\r\nThe flag is used to disable the informer for a custom resource, effectively making the corresponding CRD optional in the cluster. You can provide the flag multiple times.\r\n\r\nCurrent options include `extensionservices` and the experimental Gateway API features `tlsroutes` and `grpcroutes`.\r\n\r\nFor example, to disable ExtensionService CRD, use the flag as follows: `--disable-feature=extensionservices`.\r\n\r\n(#5080, @nsimons)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: support GRPCRoute\r\n\r\nContour now implements GRPCRoute (https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/grpcroute/). The \"core conformance\" parts of the spec are implemented. See https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.25/guides/grpc/#gateway-api-configuration on how to use GRPCRoute.\r\n\r\n(#5114, @fangfpeng)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Add `AllowPrivateNetwork` to `CORSPolicy` for support Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network. (#5034, @lvyanru8200)\r\n- Optimize processing of HTTPProxy, Secret and other objects by avoiding full object comparison. This reduces CPU usage during object updates. (#5064, @tsaarni)\r\n- Gateway API: support the `path` field on the HTTPRoute RequestRedirect filter. (#5068, @skriss)\r\n- Optimized the memory usage when handling Secrets in Kubernetes client informer cache. (#5099, @tsaarni)\r\n- Adds a new gauge metric, `contour_dag_cache_object`, to indicate the total number of items that are currently in the DAG cache. (#5109, @izturn)\r\n- Gateway API: for routes, replace use of custom `NotImplemented` condition with the upstream `Accepted: false` condition with reason `UnsupportedValue` to match the spec. (#5125, @skriss)\r\n- `%REQ()` operator in request/response header policies now properly supports HTTP/2 pseudo-headers, header fallbacks, and truncating header values. (#5130, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: for routes, always set ResolvedRefs condition, even if true to match the spec. (#5131, @izturn)\r\n- Set 502 response if include references another root. (#5157, @liangyuanpeng)\r\n- Update to support Gateway API v0.6.2, which includes updated conformance tests. See release notes [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.6.2). (#5194, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- HTTPProxy: support Host header rewrites per-service. (#5195, @fangfpeng)\r\n- Contour now sets `GOMAXPROCS` to match the number of CPUs available to the container which results in lower and more stable CPU usage under high loads and where the container and node CPU counts differ significantly.\r\nThis is the default behavior but can be overridden by specifying `GOMAXPROCS` to a fixed value as an environment variable. (#5211, @rajatvig)\r\n- Gateway API: Contour now always sets the Accepted condition on Gateway Listeners. If there is a specific validation error of top-level fields (port, protocol, etc.) the status is set to False, otherwise it is set to True. (#5220, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: Envoy containers manifests should use value from `envoy.health.port` and `envoy.metrics.port` if they are defined in `ContourDeployment.spec.runtimeSettings`. (#5233, @Jean-Daniel)\r\n- Gateway API: support regex path/header match for HTTPRoute and regex header match for GRPCRoute. (#5239, @fangfpeng)\r\n- Fix HTTPProxy duplicate include detection. If we have multiple distinct includes on the same path but different headers or query parameters, duplicates of any include conditions after the first were not detected. (#5296, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Gateway API: support regular expressions in HTTPRoute query param match type. (#5310, @padlar)\r\n- Supported/tested Kubernetes versions are now 1.25, 1.26, 1.27. (#5318, @skriss)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.26.1. See the [v1.26.0 and v1.26.1 changelogs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.26.1/version_history/v1.26/v1.26) for details. (#5320, @skriss)\r\n- Updates to Go 1.20.4. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20) for more information. (#5347, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Upgrade algolia docsearch to v3 on the docs website (#5129, @pnbrown)\r\n- Updates Steve Kriss as Tech Lead and moves Nick Young to Emeritus Maintainer (#5151, @pnbrown)\r\n- Move to a single set of docs per minor release, e.g. 1.24, 1.23 and 1.22.

tool.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Distributed Deployment Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/deployment/distributed-deployment-guide).\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade from v2.0.1 to v2.1.0\r\n* Apply [apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/blob/master/scripts/sql/delta/v200-v210/apolloconfigdb-v200-v210.sql) to ApolloConfigDB\r\n* Deploy v2.1.0 executables with the following sequences:\r\n  * apollo-configservice\r\n  * apollo-adminservice\r\n  * apollo-portal\r\n* Execute the following SQL to clear the spring sessions as spring security sessions are not compatible between versions, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/9204\r\n```sql\r\nuse ApolloPortalDB;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES`;\r\ndelete from `SPRING_SESSION`;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @shenhuaxin made their first contribution in https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/4409\r\n* @lorgine-li made their first
