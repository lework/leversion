Fixes for K8s 1.22\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/11448\r\n\r\nOur webhook parser no longer rejects unknown fields in an object's `metadata`. New fields were introduced in K8s 1.22 which caused Knative's webhook to reject certain operations.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Renaming of some net-kourier components\r\n\r\nRelated issue: [knative/networking#448](https://github.com/knative/networking/issues/448)\r\n\r\nAs part of our efforts to GA/1.0 we've standardized on the naming of our networking plugins that are installed along side Serving. If you're managing your Knative deployment manually with kubectl this will require a two-phase upgrade process. In order to upgrade [net-kourier to v0.25.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/releases/tag/v0.25.0) using `kubectl` please follow the steps:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Apply the new release\r\n$ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml\r\n\r\n# Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but \r\n# prune the old resources\r\n$ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml \\\r\n  --prune -l networking.knative.dev/ingress-provider=kourier\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Disabling namespace certificate provisioning legacy label\r\n\r\nThe namespace label `networking.internal.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert` has been deprecated since v0.15.0 release in favour of `networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert`. We have dropped support for this legacy label. ([#11626](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11626), [@nak3](https://github.com/nak3))\r\n\r\n \r\n### \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n- A feature flag is available to enable priorityClassName for Knative Services. See config-features for details. ([#11746](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11746), [@nealhu](https://github.com/nealhu))\r\n- Add memory metrics for HPA: `hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev` ([#11668](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11668), [@zhaojizhuang](https://github.com/zhaojizhuang))\r\n- Added `app.kubernetes.io/name` labels to resources. It will be replacing app labels in the future. ([#11655](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11655), [@upodroid](https://github.com/upodroid))\r\n- `Containers[*].securityContext.runAsNonRoot` can be set to true without a feature flag ([#11606](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11606), [@senthilnathan](https://github.com/senthilnathan))\r\n- Users can set `spec.template.spec.automountServiceAccountToken` to `false` in a PodSpec in order to opt-out of Kubenetes' default behaviour of mounting a ServiceAccount token in that Pod's containers. ([#11723](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11723), [@psschwei](https://github.com/psschwei))\r\n- Add v1beta1 version of DomainMapping crd ([#11682](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11682), [@julz](https://github.com/julz))\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1e Bug Fixes\r\n- Set `ENABLE_HTTP2_AUTO_DETECTION` to `false` by default if the feature is not enabled.

FEATURE: vmagent: add ability to read scrape configs from multiple files specified in `scrape_config_files` section. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1559).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: reduce memory usage and CPU usage when [Prometheus staleness tracking](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) is enabled for metrics exported from the deleted or disappeared scrape targets.\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: add the ability to limit the number of unique time series scraped per each target. This can be done either globally via `-promscrape.seriesLimitPerTarget` command-line option or on per-target basis via `series_limit` option at `scrape_config` section. See [the updated docs on cardinality limiter](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#cardinality-limiter) and [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1561).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: discover `role: ingress` and `role: endpointslice` in [kubernetes_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config) via v1 API instead of v1beta1 API if Kubernetes supports it. This fixes service discovery in Kubernetes v1.22 and newer versions. See [these docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#ingress-v122).\r\n* FEATURE: take into account failed queries in `vm_request_duration_seconds` summary at `/metrics`. Previously only successful queries were taken into account. This could result in skewed summary. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1537).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add an official dashboard for vmalert. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#monitoring).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add ability to set additional labels per group via `labels` config section. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1471).\r\n* FEATURE: vmalert: add `-disableAlertgroupLabel` command-line flag for disabling the label with alert group name. This may be needed for proper deduplication in Alertmanager. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1532).\r\n* FEATURE: update Go builder from v1.16.7 to v1.17.0. This improves data ingestion and query performance by up to 5% according to benchmarks. See [the release post for Go1.17](https://go.dev/blog/go1.17).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent: expose `promscrape_discovery_http_errors_total` metric, which can be used for monitoring the number of failed discovery attempts per each `http_sd` config.\r\n* FEATURE: do not reset response cache when a sample with old timestamp is ingested into VictoriaMetrics if `-search.disableAutoCacheReset` command-line option is set. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1570).\r\n* FEATURE: add `quantiles(\"quantileLabel\", phi1, ..., phiN, q)` aggregate function to [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html), which calculates the given `phi*` quantiles over time series returned by `q`. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1573).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: rename `sign` function to `sgn` in order to be consistent with PromQL. See [this pull request from Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/8457).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmagent: add `role: endpointslice` in [kubernetes_sd_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config) in order to be consistent with Prometheus. Previously this role was supported with incorrect name: `role: endpointslices`. Now both `endpointslice` and `endpointslices` are supported. See [the corresponding code in Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/2ec6c7dbb82b72834021e01f1773eb90a67a371f/discovery/kubernetes/kubernetes.go#L99).\r\n* BUGFIX: improve the detection of the needed free space for background merge operation. This should prevent from possible out of disk space crashes during big merges. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1560).\r\n* BUGFIX: vmauth: remove trailing slash from the full url before requesting it from the backend. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1554).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html): fix timeout error when snapshot takes longer than 10 seconds.

The implementation can be found in [github.com/open-policy-agent/storage/disk](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/storage/disk). There is also an example in the [`rego` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego#pkg-examples) that shows how policies can be evaluated with the disk-based store. The disk-based store is currently only available as a library (i.e., it is not integrated into the rest of OPA yet.) In the next few releases, we are planning to integrate the implementation into the OPA server and provide tooling to help leverage the disk-based store.\r\n\r\n### Built-in Functions\r\n\r\nThis release includes a few improvements to existing built-in functions:\r\n\r\n- The `http.send` function now supports UNIX domain sockets ([#3661](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3661)) authored by @[kirk-patton](https://github.com/kirk-patton)\r\n- The `units.parse_bytes` function now supports E* and P* units ([#2911](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2911))\r\n- The `io.jwt.encode_sign` function uses the built-in context randomization source (which is helpful for replay purposes)\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\nThis release includes multiple improvements for OPA server deployments in serverless environments:\r\n\r\n- Plugins can now be triggered manually within OPA. This feature allows users extending and customizing OPA to control exactly when operations like bundle downloads and decision log uploads occur. The built-in plugins now include a `trigger` configuration that can be set to `manual` or `periodic` (which is the default). When `manual` triggering is enabled, the plugins WILL NOT perform any periodic/background operations. Instead, the plugins will only execute when the [`Trigger`](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/main/plugins/plugins.go#L101) API is invoked.\r\n- Plugins can now wait for server initialization. When runtime initialization is finished, plugins can be notified. This allows plugins to synchronize their behaviour with server startup. [#3701](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3701) authored by @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11).\r\n- The [Health API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#health-api) now supports an `exclude-plugin` parameter to control which plugins are checked. [#3713](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3713) authored by @[gshively11](https://github.com/gshively11).\r\n\r\n### Tooling\r\n\r\n- The compiler no longer fetches remote schemas by default when used as as library. Capabilities have been updated to include an `allow_net` field to control whether network operations can be performed ([#3746](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3746)). This field is only used to control schema fetching today. In future versions of OPA, the `allow_net` parameter will be used to control other behaviour like `http.send`.\r\n- The `WebAssembly runtime not supported` error message has been improved [#3739](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/3739).\r\n\r\n### Rego\r\n\r\n- Added support for `anyOf` and `allOf` keywords in JSON schema support in the type checker ([#3592](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3592)) authored by [@jchen10500](https://github.com/jchen10500) and [@juliafriedman8](https://github.com/juliafriedman8).\r\n- Added support for custom JSON result marshalling in the `rego` package.\r\n- Added a new convenience function (`Allowed() bool`) to the `rego.ResultSet` API.\r\n- Improved string-representation construction performance for arrays, sets, and objects.\r\n- Improved the topdown evaluator to support `ast.Value` results from the store so that unnecessary conversions can be avoided.\r\n- Improved the `rego` package to make the wasmtime-go dependency optional at build-time ([#3545](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3545)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the comprehension indexer whereby index keys were not constructed correctly leading to incorrect outputs ([#3579](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3579)).\r\n- Fixed a stack overflow during partial evaluation due to incorrect term rewriting in the copy propagation implementation ([#3071](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3071)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in partial evaluation when shallow inlinign is enabled that resulted in built-in functions being invoked instead of saved ([#3681](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3681)).\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly\r\n\r\n- The internal Wasm SDK now supports the inter-query built-in cache.\r\n- The pre-compiled runtime is now built with llvm 12.0.1 and the builder image includes clang-format.\r\n- The internal Wasm SDK has been updated to use wasmtime-go v0.29.0.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThis release includes a number of documentation improvements:\r\n\r\n- The wasm `opa_eval` arguments have been clarified [#3699](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3696)\r\n- The contributing and development guide have been moved into a dedicated [Contributing](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/contributing/) section on the website [#3751](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3751)\r\n- The Envoy standalone tutorial includes cleanup steps now (thanks [@princespaghetti](https://github.com/princespaghetti))\r\n- Various typos have been fixed by multiple folks (thanks [@Tej-Singh-Rana](https://github.com/Tej-Singh-Rana) [@gujun4990](https://github.com/gujun4990))\r\n- The Kubernetes ingress validation tutorial has been updated to include new mandatory attributes and newer API versions (thanks [@ereslibre](https://github.com/ereslibre))\r\n- The recommendations around using OPA Gatekeeper have been improved.\r\n\r\n### Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- OPA is now built with Go v1.17 and CI jobs have been added to ensure OPA builds with older versions of Go.\r\n\r\n### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe `rego` package no longer relies on build constraints to enable the Wasm runtime. Instead, library users must opt-in to Wasm runtime support by adding an import statement in the Go code:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nimport _ \"github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/features/wasm\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that (by default) the wasmtime-go blobs are not vendored in projects that embed OPA as a library. If you are currently relying on the Wasm runtime support in the `rego` package (via the `rego.Target(\"wasm\")` option), please update you code to include the import above.

Please try it and feedback. Thanks for all the contributions!\r\n\r\n- [Support Kubernetes v1.22 and CSI components version update](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2757)\r\n  - Updates the minimum supported version of Kubernetes to v1.18, can support Kubernetes v1.22 by migrating some deprecated resources to active resource versions and bump the version of CSI components.\r\n- [Upload backing image](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2404)\r\n  - Besides downloading backing images from remote in v1.1.1, users can upload backing images from local.\r\n- [Create backing image from volume](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2403)\r\n  - Besides downloading backing images from remote in v1.1.1, users can create backing images from existing volumes.\r\n- [Enhance Longhorn data plane on low performance enviroment](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2206)\r\n  - Enhance Longhorn data plane on low performance environment to better support in differnt resource factors (spinning disk, low network bandwidth, low CPU, network latency, etc).\r\n- [Volume encryption](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1859) & [Backup encryption](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/902) [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/advanced-resources/volume-encryption/)]\r\n  - Longhorn supports encrypted volumes by utilizing the linux kernel modules and uses the Kubernetes secret mechanism for key storage. An encrypted volume results in your data being encrypted while in transit as well as at rest, this also means that any backups taken from that volume are also encrypted.\r\n- [Volume cloning](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1815) [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/snapshots-and-backups/csi-volume-clone/)]\r\n  - Supports CSI volume cloning.\r\n- [Support automatic replica rebalancing](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/587) [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/high-availability/auto-balance-replicas/)]\r\n  - Supports automatically replica rebalancing when node status changes (on/off) based on node/zone soft anti-affinity.\r\n- [Asynchronous backup operations](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1761)\r\n  - Supports asynchronous backup operations by introducing backup target, backup volume and backup custom resource and controllers to improve the performance issues of backup operations in previous versions.\r\n- [Recurring job & group](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/467) [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/snapshots-and-backups/scheduling-backups-and-snapshots/)]\r\n  - Supports the concept of recurring job and group by introducing recuring job custom resource and controller. Users can create/resue recurring jobs and organize their jobs in groups to apply to volumes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n> **Known issue:** \r\n> **After installing/upgrading to Longhorn v1.2.0, if using the default storage class created by Longhorn, you will probably encounter a `fsGroup` ineffective issue when creating a new fs volume. This is due to the default fs setting being removed from the updated CSI external-provisioner. The solution has been provided (ref: https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2964#issuecomment-910969543) and this issue will be resolved in the following patch release (1.2.1) by the end of September.** \r\n\r\nLonghorn supports 3 installation ways including Rancher catalog, Kubectl, and Helm. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/deploy/install/).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n> **1. Please ensure your Kubernetes cluster is at least v1.18 before upgrading to Longhorn v1.2.0, because the supported Kubernetes version has been updated (>= v1.18) in v1.2.0.**\r\n> **2. After the upgrade, the recurring job settings of volumes will be migrated to new recurring job resources and the `RecurringJobs` field in the volume spec will be deprecated. [[doc](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/deploy/upgrade/#4-automatically-migrate-recurring-jobs)]**\r\n\r\nFollow the upgrade instructions [here](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.0/deploy/upgrade/).\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n  \r\n  - [FEATURE] Default recurring backup policy ([467](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/467)) - @kaxing @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support automatic rebalance the replicas based on soft anti-affinity ([587](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/587)) - @kaxing @c3y1huang\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support backup encryption ([902](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/902)) - @joshimoo @meldafrawi\r\n  - [REFACTORING] Longhorn Backup refactoring ([1761](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1761)) - @jenting @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support CSI volume cloning ([1815](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1815)) - @PhanLe1010 @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] Volume Encryption ([1859](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1859)) - @joshimoo @meldafrawi\r\n  - [FEATURE] Speed up rebuilding by getting checksum simultaneously ([1948](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1948)) - @joshimoo @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [BUG] Volume Attachment Recovery Policy feature conflicts with Pod Deletion Policy ([2060](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2060)) - @joshimoo @smallteeths\r\n  - [FEATURE] Enhance Longhorn data plane on low performance environment (spinning disk, 1GBps network, low CPU etc) ([2206](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2206)) - @keithalucas @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] Create backing image from volume ([2403](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2403)) - @shuo-wu\r\n  - [FEATURE] Backing image upload ([2404](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2404)) - @kaxing @shuo-wu\r\n  - [BUG] Failed rebuilding a large replica of 3TB ([2507](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2507)) - @joshimoo @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [BUG] Recurring jobs never run again when the volume is attached after being detached for a long time ([2513](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2513)) - @kaxing @PhanLe1010\r\n  - [BUG] Volumes are not properly mounted/unmounted when kubelet restarts ([2629](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2629)) - @joshimoo @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] Bump Kubernetes, API version group, CSI component's dependency version ([2757](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2757)) - @meldafrawi @PhanLe1010\r\n  \r\n## Enhancements\r\n  \r\n  - [FEATURE] Change default log level for csi sidecars, to reduce leader election log spam ([1202](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/1202)) - @joshimoo\r\n  - [FEATURE] automatic sucessful backups should only retain the last snapshot ([2231](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2231)) - @cclhsu @kaxing @PhanLe1010\r\n  - [BUG] Application couldn't mount the volume after expanded the volume ([2422](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2422)) - @cclhsu @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [FEATURE] Backing image enhancement ([2530](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2530)) - @kaxing @shuo-wu\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support Read only volumes (PVC/PV) and mounts ([2575](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2575)) - @joshimoo @meldafrawi\r\n  - [ENHANCEMENT] Add labels for created cron jobs / backup pods for recurring jobs ([2701](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2701)) - @kaxing @PhanLe1010\r\n  - [FEATURE] Enable pprof endpoints in longhorn manager for troubleshooting ([2715](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2715)) - @kaxing @joshimoo\r\n  - [FEATURE]  WebSocket to support updating BackupVolume and Backup changes ([2740](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2740)) - @kaxing @smallteeths @jenting\r\n  - [FEATURE]  ui show exact time, not only \"xx days ago\" ([2808](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2808)) - @kaxing @smallteeths\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support XFS for RWX volumes ([2814](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2814)) - @joshimoo @meldafrawi\r\n  - [FEATURE] UI support encrypted volumes ([2841](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2841)) - @meldafrawi @smallteeths\r\n  - [FEATURE] Support encrypted RWX volumes ([2867](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2867)) - @joshimoo @meldafrawi\r\n  \r\n## Performance\r\n  \r\n  - [BUG] Daemon set takes more time to come up with RWX PVC ([2102](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2102)) - @c3y1huang\r\n  - [BUG] full data over WS at per 30/seconds interval seems useless ([2591](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/2591)) - @c3y1huang @khushboo-rancher\r\n  - [BUG] List order caused full data transfer when no resource updated.

Users now see a collapsed subset of the most-used Kubernetes resources expressed in simple terms. All Kubernetes resources can be managed through the explorer and quickly found through the resource search functionality. Cluster admins can now administer projects from the cluster detail view. Cluster tools like logging and monitoring are now aggregated under a new easy-to-discover **Cluster Tools.** The cluster detail page is now enhanced with cluster and pod live metrics dashboards when monitoring is deployed through the Cluster Tools. See [#2578](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/2578)\r\n- **New home page**: The default landing page provides a quick overview of the Rancher installation. Users can see what is new in the current release, find support, quickly launch into a cluster, or provision their first cluster. See [#2511](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/2511).\r\n- **New global navigation**: The primary navigation menu has been redesigned and simplified to make it easier for users and admins to quickly switch between clusters and top-level apps. See [#2499](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/2499).\r\n- **New cluster manager navigation**: The new cluster management page lists all of a user's clusters and has been enhanced with a new left-hand navigation menu to manage clusters, credentials, pod security policy templates and node drivers from a single place. See [#2849](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/2849).\r\n\r\nBecause the Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer from Rancher v2.5 have been consolidated into a unified experience, those terms have been replaced in these release notes with \"the global view\" and \"the cluster detail page.\"\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Branding and Customization Options\r\n\r\nA new brand management page has been added to allow customizations to the Rancher UI in a single place:\r\n\r\n- Admins can now customize the logo image, display name, and primary color displayed throughout the Rancher UI.\r\n- Admins can specify a link to direct users to a custom support page.\r\n- Admins can disable displaying Rancher community support links on the new home page.\r\n- Cluster navigation customizations:\r\n  - Users can now add top-level links in the left navigation of the cluster detail page.\r\n  - Users can create groups of links that point to external and services within the cluster.\r\n\r\nFor details, see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/branding/) and [#2835](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/2835).\r\n\r\n### Enhancements for Hosted Kubernetes Clusters\r\n\r\n- **AKS provisioning enhancements:** AKS provisioning has been enhanced to support the full lifecycle management of the cluster. Users can now provision private AKS endpoints, multiple node pools, and leverage Rancher cloud credentials for authentication. Existing AKS clusters provisioned with other tools like the Azure Portal can now be registered into Rancher to allow management of Kubernetes upgrades and configuration going forward. Node pools can be configured with AKS to automatically enable autoscaling. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-admin/editing-clusters/aks-config-reference/#changes-in-rancher-v2-6).\r\n  - **Note for AKS Clusters with RBAC Disabled:** It is possible to create an AKS cluster in the Azure portal that has RBAC disabled. Since Rancher relies heavily on RBAC, a warning message is displayed when registering and viewing an AKS cluster in Rancher that has RBAC disabled. See [#27670](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/27670).\r\n- **GKE provisioning enhancements:** GKE provisioning builds on the updates in Rancher 2.5 that support full lifecycle management of GKE clusters. The GKE enhancements allow users to leverage shared VPCs and multiple node pools within Google Cloud Platform. GKE node pools can be also be configured to support the native autoscaling capabilities.\r\n  - **Ability to support network tags:** When provisioning node pools in GKE clusters, users can add [network tags](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags) to make firewall rules and routes between subnets.\r\n  - **Ability to support Project Network Isolation for registered GKE clusters**: Admins and project owners can now leverage project network isolation to restrict network access between projects on imported/registered GKE clusters.\r\n- **Deploying on hardened clusters:** Support has been added for deploying EKS, AKS, and GKE clusters when the Rancher Management server cluster has been CIS hardened. See [#29066](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29066).\r\n\r\n### Security Enhancements\r\n\r\n- **Username and Identity Provider (IdP) name added to Rancher and Kubernetes audit logs**: Admins can now view Rancher usernames and IdP (e.g., Active Directory and Github) usernames in the Kubernetes audit logs and the Rancher API audit logs, when interacting with the cluster through Rancher UI. Downstream cluster admins no longer have to map the u-********* name back to a user in the Rancher local cluster manually. This allows admins to track a user's activity by using the IDP username throughout the system including login and failed login attempts. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/troubleshooting/userid-tracking-in-audit-logs/) and [#31166](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31166)\r\n- **Rancher server container based on SLE BCI image**: The base image for Rancher server has been moved to SLE BCI. See [#33127](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33127).\r\n- **Rancher API token hashing**: A new opt-in feature flag has been added to enable one-way hashing of Rancher tokens. Enabling this flag is one-way and non-reversible and should be vetted in dev/test environments before enabling in production. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/api/api-tokens) and issues [#31214](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31214)and [#25723](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/25723).\r\n- **Randomly generated bootstrap password**: A random bootstrap password is always generated for the user when Rancher is started for the first time, unless the users sets `bootstrapPassword` in the Helm chart values or `CATTLE_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` on the Docker container. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/bootstrap-password) and [#121](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/32749).\r\n- **Sanitized audit log data:** Audit logs level 2+ no longer output sensitive data (Passwords) in plain text. See [#33338](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/33338).\r\n- **Restricted admin permissions:** Permissions for a user with a \"Restricted Admin\" role have been fixed so that the user is able to perform the following operations, even though they have restricted access to the local cluster:\r\n  - Deploy AKS/GKE/EKS clusters\r\n\r\n### Tech Preview - RKE2 Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\nRancher 2.6 introduces a new provisioning framework built on top of Cluster API for provisioning RKE2 clusters from the Rancher UI/API.\r\n\r\n- **Out of the box node driver support**: RKE2 provisioning can create VMs on the major cloud providers leveraging cloud credentials. New in RKE2 provisioning with Rancher node drivers is the ability to SSH into the node directly from the Rancher UI. See [#32516](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32516). \r\n  - AWS. See [#32367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32367).\r\n  - Azure. See [#32368](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32368).\r\n  - vSphere. See [#32370](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32370).\r\n  - Digital Ocean. See [#32366](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32366).\r\n  - Linode. See [#32371](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32371).\r\n- **Additional CNI options**: RKE2 brings with it new supported CNI options. Rancher's project network isolation feature can be used with CNIs that support Kubernetes network policies. See [#32378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32378).\r\n  - Calico support. See [#32380](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32380).\r\n  - Cilium support. See [#32381](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32381).\r\n  - Multus support. See [#32382](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32382).\r\n  - Canal support. See [#32379](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32379).\r\n- **Support for Authorized Cluster Endpoint**: Cluster admins can configure Rancher's Authorized Cluster Endpoint locally in RKE2 clusters to allow direct access to the cluster without passing through the Rancher Management server proxy. See [#32388](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32388).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tech Preview - RKE2 Windows Node support\r\n\r\n- **RKE2 Cluster provisioning supports Windows nodes:** Users can now provision custom RKE2 clusters with Windows nodes using a single command on pre-provisioned VMs or bare metal nodes. See [#1240](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/1240).\r\n- **Calico CNI support for Windows nodes:** Windows nodes support Calico CNI as the default network plugin. See [#49](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/49) and [#1529](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/1529).\r\n- **Known Issues:**:\r\n  - Air gap support is not currently supported for Windows Containers on Rancher on RKE2.\r\n  - Setting an external IP is currently not an option for Windows Containers.\r\n- **Documentation for RKE2 Windows Cluster Provisioning:**\r\n  - [Windows RKE2 Quickstart Guide](https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart/#windows-agent-worker-node-installation)\r\n  - [Experimental RKE2 Windows Airgap Support](https://docs.rke2.io/install/windows_airgap/)\r\n  - [Windows Agent Configuration Reference](https://docs.rke2.io/install/install_options/windows_agent_config/). See [#1276](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/1276).\r\n  - [Windows Uninstall Script for RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/install/windows_uninstall/). See [#1487](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/1487).\r\n\r\n### Tech Preview - Cluster Templates and Example RKE2 Cluster Template\r\n\r\nCluster templates allow an admin to define a base cluster configuration for users to consume when provisioning clusters. Cluster templates in the new provisioning framework are built as Helm charts and added to Rancher through the catalog.\r\n\r\nUnlike RKE templates, which are for enforcing Kubernetes configuration, cluster templates include more of the cluster definition options and do not affect the cluster after it is initially provisioned. Cluster templates can define node pools, cloud credentials, cluster members, and installation of Rancher tools like monitoring. We provide an example cluster template for RKE2 that can be used to provision a Kubernetes cluster with the following constraints:\r\n\r\n  - Multiple node pools for etcd/control plane and workers\r\n  - An admin provided cloud credential\r\n  - Allow users to enable the authorized cluster endpoint and specify cluster configuration options\r\n  - Install Rancher V2 Monitoring\r\n  - Assign cluster members\r\n\r\nWe provide an example cluster template for an RKE2 cluster [here.](https://github.com/rancher/cluster-template-examples#rke2-cluster-template) To customize the template, you will need to fork the repository, add the Helm chart to a Rancher catalog, and install the template through the catalog. Rancher then provisions the Kubernetes cluster, and the cluster can be managed through Rancher in the same way as any other Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nSee the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/cluster-templates) and [#30099](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30099).\r\n\r\nMore cluster template examples will be added to the [cluster template repository](https://github.com/rancher/cluster-template-examples) in the future.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements for RKE Clusters\r\n\r\n- **Added RKE External Dockershim Support**: As of Kubernetes 1.20, the in-tree Dockershim was deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes 1.22. The Dockershim is the CRI compliant layer between the Kubelet and the Docker daemon. RKE clusters now support the external Dockershim to continue leveraging Docker as the CRI runtime. We now implement the upstream open source community Dockershim announced by Mirantis and Docker to ensure RKE clusters can continue to leverage Docker. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/) and [#31943](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31943).\r\n- **Added Kubernetes 1.21**: We've added support for Kubernetes 1.21 clusters for RKE.\r\n- **NGINX Ingress default backend no longer a separate deployment**: The default backend for the NGINX Ingress controller is now self-contained. Previously, the default backend was deployed as a pod and service. See [#30356](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30356).\r\n- **Windows RKE Prefix Path Support:** Add support for Windows RKE prefix path with the ability to parse multiple styles of paths and separators. See [#32268](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32268).\r\n- **Dual-stack Support:** Starting with Kubernetes v1.21, it is possible to configure dual-stack clusters in combination with the Calico network provider. See [#33107](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33107).\r\n- **hostPort for NGINX Ingress:** The NGINX Ingress Controller version deployed with Kubernetes v1.21 and higher will be configured using hostPort instead of using hostNetwork. The NGINX Ingress Controller runs a validating admission webhook server which would be exposed externally when using hostNetwork. To avoid exposing it externally, the NGINX Ingress Controller runs in hostPort for port 80 and port 443, and the validating admission webhook server uses a ClusterIP which is only reachable from inside the cluster. See [#33792](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33792).\r\n- **ECR repository private registry configuration support**: Added support to configure ECR repository as a private registry. See [#28693](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28693).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Logging Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Added support for configuring `fluentd` and `fluent-bit` buffer sizes. See [#28401](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28401).\r\n- Added support for more `fluentd` options: `bufferStorageVolume`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` (specific to `fluentd`), and `replicas`. See [#31807](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31807).\r\n- Added support for Windows RKE prefix path with the ability to handle multiple kinds of pathing styles and separators. See [#32268](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32268).\r\n- K3s logs are now aggregated through journald and are more refined. See [#32993](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32993).\r\n- The number of fluentd replicas is now configurable. See [#33373](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33373).\r\n- Upgraded the Banzai logging operator to version 3.10.0. See [#32748](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32748).\r\n- Added timestamps to RKE2 control plane logs. See [#32917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32917).\r\n\r\n### Continuous Delivery Enhancements\r\n\r\n- **Extended support for Fleet values:** Add `valuesFrom` feature for `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` to provide `values.yaml` for Fleet. See [#384](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/384).\r\n- **Ability to support bundle dependencies:** Support bundle dependency. See [#392](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/392).\r\n- **Updated namespaces to avoid potential Fleet naming conflicts:** Move Fleet to `cattle-fleet-system` from `fleet-system` to avoid collisions with other apps named `fleet`. See [#395](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/395).\r\n- **New Fleet GitOps feature flag:** Rancher v2.6's new cluster provisioning system leverages Fleet's bundle deployment capabilities in order to manage clusters at scale. Therefore, in Rancher v2.6, Fleet can no longer be disabled. If Fleet was disabled in Rancher v2.5.x, it will become enabled if Rancher is upgraded to v2.6.x. A new feature flag was added to Rancher to disable the GitOps CD portion for end users within Rancher. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/feature-flags/continuous-delivery), [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688) and [#32808](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32808).\r\n- **Miscellaneous fixes for Provisioning V2:** various edge cases were mitigated and performance inconsistencies were fixed in preparation for Provisioning V2.\r\n\r\n### Other Enhancements\r\n\r\n- **Support for Keycloak with OIDC**: A new Keycloak auth provider has been added to support OIDC. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/authentication/keycloak-oidc/) and [#30280](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30280).\r\n- **Catalog performance enhancement:** Catalogs will be greatly reduced in size, depending on their contents. See [#32938](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32938).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix workload environment variables interpolation order by deprecating our custom `environment` and `environmentFrom` types in favor of Kubernetes `env` and `envFrom` native types. See [#16148](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16148).\r\n- EKS, AKS, and GKE provisioners now correctly use any additional CAs passed to Rancher, if provided. See [#31846](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31846).\r\n- The GKE cluster provisioner now handles differences in supported Kubernetes versions across regions. See [#33524](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33524).\r\n- The GKE cluster provisioner was updated to handle changes to how the provider configures public and private clusters. See [#33241](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33241).\r\n- The EKS cluster provisioner now correctly adds labels to clusters without causing the cluster to be in a perpetual updating state. See [#33302](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33302).\r\n- Global DNS app gets uninstalled/removed immediately after install due to OwnerReferences cleanup enforced in Kubernetes v1.20. Instead of relying on the ownerReference for deletion of the app after GlobalDNSProvider is removed, fix is added to handle the delete event in the controller to remove the app. See [#31638](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31638).\r\n- Project Network Isolation ingress NetworkPolicy resources now get configured correctly when using Calico CNI with IPIP or VXLAN routing. See [#33979](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33979).\r\n- The Multi-cluster management feature flag can now only be disabled when starting Rancher. Previously, disabling the flag through the UI would result in a `404 page not found` error. See [#32721](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32721).\r\n- Users can now use the `answersSetString` field to ensure values are passed as a string as expected by the app being configured. See [#26088](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/26088).\r\n- The health status of the Controller Mananger and Scheduler on the dashboard will show as `Not Applicable` on clusters where the componentstatus is not available. See [#11496](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/11496).\r\n- Custom encryption configuration is no longer required to be case sensitive. See [#31385](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31385)\r\n- The `rancher.cattle.io` MutatingWebhookConfiguration object is now deleted when Rancher is uninstalled, which would otherwise cause failures reinstalling Rancher on the same cluster. See [#33988](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33988)\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:** The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observer restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **New steps for rolling back Rancher**: The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **Machines vs Kube Nodes** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.0\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.12](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.12)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.0](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.0)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0 many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nPlease review the new feature flags introduced into 2.6.0 and their default status.\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tWe have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes 1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging (Legacy)\r\n* CIS Scans (Legacy)\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions**\r\n  - **RKE**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Tech Preview**: There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.\r\n    - Sometimes the nodes may not be cleaned up in the infrastructure provider when deleting clusters or nodes. Please be sure to review the actual nodes after cleaning up a cluster. See [#34542](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34542).\r\n    - There are issues around removing etcd nodes from a cluster. See [#34488](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34488).\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - Proxy behind individual downstream clusters is not working. See [#32633](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32633).\r\n    - Cloud providers are not working for Azure clusters. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367).\r\n    - Windows Containers are not supported on Windows Server Standard Edition. Windows Server Datacenter Edition is required. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405)\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When upgrading the Kubernetes version in an AKS cluster, do not add a node pool at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33426](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33426).\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561)\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - When upgrading an AKS cluster Kubernetes minor versions cannot be skipped. All upgrades must be performed sequentially by major version number. See [#34161](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34161)\r\n  - **GKE**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**:\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the resourceSet rancher-resource-set will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n  - **Monitoring**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.10.4 will be available with the Rancher Istio Helm chart v100.0.0+up1.10.4. A previous version of Istio, 1.10.2, included a security fix for CVE-2021-34824. See [#32795](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32795).\r\n    - Istio 1.9 support ends on August 18th, 2021.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. The everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).\r\n    - When v1 Istio is installed in a cluster, the side navigation will incorrectly show a top-level 'Istio' menu item. This should be ignored for v1 Istio and users should instead use the Istio functionality under the 'Legacy' top-level menu item (this requires the legacy feature flag to be enabled). See [#4072](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4072).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.21. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n- **Docker installs:** There are UI issues around startup time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800) and [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n- **Login to Rancher using ActiveDirectory with TLS:** See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).\r\n  - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an ActiveDirectory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Golang 1.15.\r\n  - The error received is \"Error creating ssl connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\"\r\n  - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting \"GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\" as an environment variable to Rancher server container.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-30T22:36:34Z", "project": "Rancher",

To resolve this you must first upgrade to Tempo 0.7.0+ (latest 1.1 is recommended) which introduces the supported v2 block format.  Tempo will write all new blocks as v2, and it must continue running until all v0 and v1 blocks are gone (either deleted due to retention, or compacted).

If you are using queue subscriptions on a JetStream Push Consumer or have created multiple push subscriptions on the same consumer, you may be affected and need to upgrade your client version along with the server version.  We\u2019ve detailed the behavior with different client versions below.\r\n\r\nWith a NATS Server **prior** to v2.4.0 and client libraries **prior** to these versions: NATS C client v3.1.0, Go client v1.12.0, Java client 2.12.0-SNAPSHOT, NATS.js v2.2.0, NATS.ws v1.3.0, NATS.deno v1.2.0, NATS .NET 0.14.0-pre2:\r\n\r\n- It was possible to create multiple non-queue subscription instances for the same JetStream durable consumer. This is not correct since each instance will receive the same copy of a message and acknowledgment is therefore meaningless since the first instance to acknowledge the message will prevent other instances to control if/when a message should be acknowledged.\r\n- Similar to the first issue, it was possible to create many different queue groups for one single JetStream consumer. \r\n- For queue subscriptions, if no consumer nor durable name was provided, the libraries would create ephemeral JetStream consumers, which meant that each member of the same group would receive the same message than the other members, which was not the expected behavior. Users assumed that 2 members subscribing to \u201cfoo\u201d with the queue group named \u201cbar\u201d would load-balance the consumption of messages from the stream/consumer.\r\n- It was possible to create a queue subscription on a JetStream consumer configured with heartbeat and/or flow control. This does not make sense because by definition, queue members would receive some (randomly distributed) messages, so the library would think that heartbeat are missed, and flow control would also be disrupted.\r\n\r\nIf above client libraries are not updated to the latest but the NATS server is upgraded to v2.4.0:\r\n\r\n- It is still possible to create multiple non-queue subscription instances for the same JetStream durable consumer. Since the check is performed by the library (with the help of a new field called `PushBound` in the consumer information object set by the server), this mis-behavior is still possible.\r\n- Queue subscriptions will not receive any message. This is because the server now has a new field `DeliverGroup` in the consumer configuration, which won\u2019t be set for existing JetStream consumers and by the older libraries, and detects interest (and starts delivering) only when a subscription on the deliver subject for a queue subscription matching the \u201cdeliver group\u201d name is found. Since the JetStream consumer is thought to be a non-deliver-group consumer, the opposite happens: the server detects an core NATS *queue* subscription on the \u201cdeliver subject\u201d, therefore does not trigger delivery on the JetStream consumer\u2019s \u201cdeliver subject\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe 2 other issues are still present because those checks are done in the updated libraries.\r\n\r\nIf the above client libraries are update to the latest version, but the NATS Server is still to version prior to v2.4.0 (that is, up to v2.3.4):\r\n\r\n- It is still possible to create multiple non-queue subscription instances for the same JetStream durable consumer. This is because the JetStream consumer\u2019s information retrieved by the library will not have the `PushBound` boolean set by the server, therefore will not be able to alert the user that they are trying to create multiple subscription instances for the same JetStream consumer.\r\n- Queue subscriptions will fail because the consumer information returned will not contain the `DeliverGroup` field. The error will be likely to the effect that the user tries to create a queue subscription to a non-queue JetStream consumer. Note that if the application creates a queue subscription for a non-yet created JetStream consumer, then this call will succeed, however, adding new members or restarting the application with the now existing JetStream consumer will fail.\r\n- Creating queue subscriptions without a named consumer/durable will now result in the library using the queue name as the durable name.\r\n- Trying to create a queue subscription with a consumer configuration that has heartbeat and/or flow control will now return an error message.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, using the latest client libraries and NATS Server v2.4.0:\r\n\r\n- Trying to start multiple non-queue subscriptions instances for the same JetStream consumer will now return an error to the effect that the user is trying to create a \u201cduplicate subscription\u201d. That is, there is already an active subscription on that JetStream consumer.\r\nIt is now only possible to create a queue group for a JetStream consumer created for that group. The `DeliverGroup` field will be set by the library or need to be provided when creating the consumer externally.\r\n- Trying to create a queue subscription without a durable nor consumer name results in the library creating/using the queue group as the JetStream consumer\u2019s durable name.\r\n- Trying to create a queue subscription with a consumer configuration that has heartbeat and/or flow control will now return an error message.\r\n\r\nNote that if the server v2.4.0 recovers existing JetStream consumers that were created prior to v2.4.0 (and with older libraries), none of them will have a `DeliverGroup`, so none of them can be used for queue subscriptions. They will have to be recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n- 1.16.7: Both release executables and Docker images are built with this Go release.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Domain to the content of a `PubAck` protocol (#2432, #2434)\r\n    - `PushBound` boolean in `ConsumerInfo` to indicate that a push consumer is already bound to an active subscription (#2438)\r\n    - `DeliverGroup` string in `ConsumerConfig` to specify which deliver group (or queue group name) the consumer is created for (#2438)\r\n    - Warning log statement in situations where catchup for a stream resulted in an error (#2444)\r\n- Monitoring:\r\n    - Ability for normal accounts to access scoped `connz` information (#2437)\r\n- Operator option `resolver_pinned_accounts` to ensure user are signed by certain accounts (#2461)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - `ConsumerInfo`'s `Delivered` and `AckFloor` are now `SequenceInfo` instead of `SequencePair`. `SequenceInfo` contains `Last` which represents the last active time (in UTC) (#2462)\r\n    - Delivery of messages for consumers will now be subject to proper group information. Older clients may fail to receive messages on a queue subscription if the library has not been updated to specify the `DeliverGroup` (#2438)\r\n \r\n### Improved\r\n- Make error message actionable when adding operator and leaf nodes. Thanks to @alsuren for the contribution (#2449)\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - File utilization when using a Jetstream stream as a KeyValue store (#2456)\r\n    - Encryption at rest with message expiration on server restart (#2467)\r\n    - Enable global account on non JetStream servers in mixed mode (#2473)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Stream delete can fail for non empty directory (#2418)\r\n    - Possible panic for concurrent stream remove and consumer create (#2419)\r\n    - Simplified flow control and avoid stalls due to message loss (#2425)\r\n    - Consumer info `max_msgs_per_subject` defaults to 0, but should be -1 (#2426)\r\n    - Creating a consumer with a `max_waiting` value and a deliver subject was returning the wrong error message (#2427)\r\n    - Assign default to `max_ack_pending` when `AckExplicit` or `AckAll` (#2428)\r\n    - Subscriptions for internal clients for JetStream consumers were not properly removed, resulting in possible subscriptions leak/high memory usage (#2439)\r\n    - Expiration of messages during a server restart could lead to clients reporting errors after reconnect when trying to send new messages (#2452)\r\n    - Added additional checks for failures during filestore encryption (#2453)\r\n    - Processing of a publish ACK could cause a server panic (#2460)\r\n    - Consumer's number of pending messages for multiple matches and merging (#2464)\r\n    - Deadlock due to lock inversion when creating a RAFT group. Thanks to @lokiwins for the report (#2471)\r\n- Leafnode:\r\n    - User authorization issue when JetStream is involved. Thanks to @wchajl for the report (#2430)\r\n    - A remote websocket connection with `wss://` scheme but no `tls{}` configuration block would be attempted as non TLS connection, resulting on an \"invalid websocket connection\" in the log of the server attempting to create the remote connection (#2442)\r\n    - Wrong permission checks prevented messages flow. Thanks to @rbboulton for the report (#2455, #2470)\r\n    - Daisy chained subject propagation issue. Thanks to @KimonHoffmann for the report (#2468)\r\n- Possible subscription leak with the use of \"AutoUnsubscribe\" (#2421)\r\n- Prevent JWT claim updates from removing system imports (#2450, #2451)\r\n- Error print when adding back existing system imports (#2466)\r\n- Build on OpenBSD-6.9. Thanks to @miraculli for the contribution (#2472)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/compare/v2.3.4...v2.4.0\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-26T22:20:56Z", "project": "NATS", "repo": "nats-io/nats-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release 2.6.3", "tag_name": "2.6.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/portainer/portainer/releases/tag/2.6.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/portainer/portainer", "body": "# 2.6.3\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes:\r\n- Added support for Kubernetes version 1.22: https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/5424\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-26T21:40:19Z", "project": "Portainer", "repo": "portainer/portainer", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v1.1.4", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/nomad/commits/dc5d056b41af08f5137892a15c2b71e3ace7ea25", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad", "body": "Release v1.1.4", "created_at": "2021-08-26T16:30:26Z", "project": "Nomad", "repo": "hashicorp/nomad", "type": "Orchestration", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z", "version": "tag"}, {"name": "Contour v1.18.1", "tag_name": "v1.18.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.18.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour", "body": "We are delighted to present version 1.18.1 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n## Envoy Admin Interface Changes to Mitigate CVE-2021-32783\r\n\r\nAs an additional mitigation for [CVE-2021-32783](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/security/advisories/GHSA-5ph6-qq5x-7jwc), [PR #3934](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3934) has been backported to this release. Previously an ExternalName service with an address of `localhost` and port matching the Envoy admin interface listener port could expose admin endpoints that would allow an attacker to shut down Envoy remotely. Contour's bootstrap command now configures Envoy to listen on a Unix domain socket to ensure an ExternalName service cannot expose the \"writable\" endpoints of the admin interface. For backwards compatibility Contour now configures an additional Envoy listener to expose endpoints useful for debugging. This listener does not expose any endpoints that can be used to modify data, set Envoy healthcheck status, or shut down Envoy. See [this documentation page](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.18.1/troubleshooting/envoy-admin-interface/) for some more detail.\r\n\r\n*Note: While this fix does mitigate some aspects of CVE-2021-32783, ExternalName service usage is still discouraged as they can still be used to expose services across namespaces.*\r\n\r\nIf you have been using the Contour example YAMLs to deploy Contour and Envoy, no changes are required except to deploy the updated YAMLs for release 1.18.1.\r\n\r\nIf you are managing your Envoy DaemonSet using another method, be sure to inspect the [updated YAML for required changes](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/v1.18.1/examples/contour/03-envoy.yaml). An [additional volume](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/v1.18.1/examples/contour/03-envoy.yaml#L134-L135) is required and it must be mounted in the [`shutdown-manager`](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/v1.18.1/examples/contour/03-envoy.yaml#L48-L50) and [`envoy`](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/v1.18.1/examples/contour/03-envoy.yaml#L95-L96) containers to ensure both have access to the Unix domain socket Envoy is now configured to listen on.\r\n\r\n## Envoy Updated to 1.19.1\r\n\r\nUpgrades the default Envoy version to 1.19.1 for security and bug fixes.

([#4882](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4882), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Update static binary bundle runc version to `v1.0.0-rc95`. ([#4920](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4920), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Updated crun in static binary bundle to v0.20.1 ([#4959](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4959), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n\r\n#### Deprecation\r\n - The internal_wipe option is now true by default. Further, it is being deprecated, and will be unconditionally true in the future. ([#5218](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5218), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### API Change\r\n - Update how the resources for a workload is specified. Now, to override a workload, the pod must have the annotation `$prefix/$ctr_name = {\"$resource_type\": \"$resource_value\"}`. The workloads feature has also been marked as experimental, which should have happened from the beginning. ([#4787](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4787), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Feature\r\n - Added `--metrics-collectors`/`metrics_collectors` configuration to enable or disable certain metrics.\r\n  All metrics collectors are enabled per default. ([#5061](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5061), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added `crio_image_pulls_layer_size` histogram metric to get insights about all pulled layer sizes. ([#5059](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5059), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added build tags as well as AppArmor and seccomp status to `crio version` output. ([#5135](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5135), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added generation of self-signed certificates for the secure metrics endpoint\r\n  if the provided cert and key paths are not available on disk. ([#5012](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5012), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added secure metrics endpoint configuration options ([#4805](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4805), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Added structural logging of container ID, sandbox ID and process ID on container start. ([#5134](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5134), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Automatically reload metrics TLS certificate and key if any of those specified files change. ([#4927](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4927), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - CNI plugins are now passed a K8S_POD_UID environment variable containing the pod UID this sandbox was started for. ([#5026](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5026), [@dcbw](https://github.com/dcbw))\r\n - Changed the logging behavior of klog messages to be included in the CRI-O logs.\r\n  The klog info verbositry is converted to CRI-O debug to lower the log verbosity. ([#4973](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4973), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n - Cri-o now does not limit the DNS search paths. ([#5199](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5199), [@gjkim42](https://github.com/gjkim42))\r\n - Enable the  \"volatile\" option for the overlay drivers when it is supported by the underlying kernel. ([#4885](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4885), [@giuseppe](https://github.com/giuseppe))\r\n - Rootless: enable resource limit when cgroup v2 controllers are delegated. ([#4528](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4528), [@AkihiroSuda](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda))\r\n - Support `io.kubernetes.cri.blockio-class` container annotation for specifying blockio class.\r\n  Support `blockio.resources.beta.kubernetes.io/pod` pod annotation for specifying the default blockio class to all containers in the pod.\r\n  Support `blockio.resources.beta.kubernetes.io/container.NAME` pod annotation for specifying the blockio class of the NAME container in the pod.\r\n  \r\n  Add blockio_config_file config file option (and corresponding --blockio-config-file for command line) for configuring blockio classes and their cgroups blockio controller parameters. ([#4873](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4873), [@askervin](https://github.com/askervin))\r\n - Support `io.kubernetes.cri.rdt-class` container annotation for specifying RDT class.\r\n  \r\n  Add rdt_config_file config file option (and corresponding --rdt-config-file for command line) for configuring the resctrl pseudo-filesystem. ([#4830](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4830), [@marquiz](https://github.com/marquiz))\r\n - The config field `drop_infra_ctr` is now true by default ([#5113](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5113), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - The runtime_config_path option, which allows to specify the path of the runtime configuration file, is now supported by CRI-O.  This is specific to the VM runtime type. ([#5035](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5035), [@fidencio](https://github.com/fidencio))\r\n - Validate certificate dates for TLS metrics endpoint ([#4990](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4990), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n - Drop support for the crio.shutdown. ([#5173](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5173), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - ExecSync requests now don't use conmon, instead calling the runtime directly, which reduces overhead. ([#4943](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4943), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n\r\n#### Bug or Regression\r\n - Add support for `absent_mount_sources_to_reject`, which allows admins to configure paths that, when mounted into a container despite not existing on the host, causes a container creation request to fail. This is useful for paths like `/etc/hostname`, which causes trouble as a directory, but possibly shouldn't be created as a file either (in the case of a dynamic hostname). ([#4844](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4844), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Add symlink /proc/mounts on /etc/mtab to container ([#5051](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/5051), [@QiWang19](https://github.com/QiWang19))\r\n - Add the config field `internal_wipe` which moves the responsibility of wiping containers after a reboot and images after an upgrade from the external binary `crio wipe` to the main crio server. This has a handful of advantages, the main one being crio is now better able to cleanup CNI resources after a reboot. ([#4767](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/pull/4767), [@haircommander](https://github.com/haircommander))\r\n - Allow users to customize conmon's resources if a pod is in a workload.

These nodes run in dedicated instance groups that can be scaled horizontally.\r\n\r\nIn 1.21, this feature is behind a feature flag as node role name, labels, taints, and domains can change based on feedback from the community.\r\n\r\n## Warm Pool (AWS only)\r\n\r\nA Warm Pool contains pre-initialized EC2 instances that can join the cluster significantly faster than regular instances. These instances run the kOps configuration process, pull known container images, and then shut down. When the ASG needs to scale out it will pull instances from the warm pool if any are available.\r\n\r\nSee the [warm pool](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#warmpool-aws-only) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n# Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* Protokube now runs as a systemd process rather than a docker container.\r\n\r\n* Support for AWS launch configurations has been removed in favour of launch templates.\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use Node Termination Handler's Queue Processor mode, which offers more functionality than the IMDS Processor mode. See [the addons page](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#queue-processor-mode) for more information.\r\n\r\n* New addon for the [CSI snapshot-controller](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#snapshot-controller).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.13 and 1.14 has been removed.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* The ClusterRoleBinding for AWS EBS CSI DaemonSet has changed name. If you installed this addon before kOps 1.21, you need run `kubectl delete crb ebs-csi-node-binding`.\r\n\r\n* To support [Node Termination Handler's Queue Process mode](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#node-termination-handler), AWS cluster deletion now requires the kops CLI have `sqs:ListQueues` and `events:ListRules` permissions regardless of whether or not the addon is used.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.22.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used as of kOps 1.22. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.21.0 release\r\n\r\n* Release 1.21.0 [@justinsb](https://github.com/justinsb)

([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- For helm based operators, added a predicate that filters resources based on selectors specified in `watches.yaml`. Only the resources that contain the labels specified by selectors will be reconciled. ([#4997](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4997))\n- For helm-based operators, support go `text/template` expansion of override values. ([#5105](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5105))\n\n### Changes\n\n- (go/v3) Fixed a bug in `make test` caused by incorrect envtest asset setup. ([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- (go/v3, ansible/v1, helm/v1) Increased resource limits for controller manager. ([#4863](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/4863))\n- Updated operator-framework dependency to 0.10.5. This specific update includes a fix for bundle validation when checking for invalid service accounts. ([#5119](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5119))\n- For helm-based operators, reverted #5042 and #4937  which modified helm release equality comparison. ([#5097](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5097))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- (ansible/v1) Previously, when scaffolding an Ansible-based operator with both Roles and Playbooks, the roles imported by the playbook could not be found when running locally (`make run`). This change prepends the `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH` environment variable with the path to the local roles directory. ([#5118](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5118))\n- For Ansible-based operators, if a request is sent without a body in the metadata it will now be extracted from the request URL and properly set owner references/dependent watches. ([#5064](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5064))\n- In `generate bundle`, exclude ServiceAccounts already in a CSV from generated bundle.

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Chunks storage has been deprecated and is now in maintenance mode.\r\n* Exemplars now supported - in-memory only.\r\n* Added many new limits, to help protect your installation against overload.\r\n* The sharding feature in Alertmanager is now considered complete.\r\n* Release now has ARM binaries and packages (but not container images, yet).\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Prevent path traversal attack from users able to control the HTTP header `X-Scope-OrgID`. #4375 (CVE-2021-36157)\r\n  * Users only have control of the HTTP header when Cortex is not frontended by an auth proxy validating the tenant IDs\r\n* [CHANGE] Enable strict JSON unmarshal for `pkg/util/validation.Limits` struct. The custom `UnmarshalJSON()` will now fail if the input has unknown fields. #4298\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage. No new features will be added to the chunks storage. The default Cortex configuration still runs the chunks engine; please check out the [blocks storage doc](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/) on how to configure Cortex to run with the blocks storage.  #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] The example Kubernetes manifests (stored at `k8s/`) have been removed due to a lack of proper support and maintenance. #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: deprecated `-store.query-chunk-limit` CLI flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`) in favour of `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`). The new limit specifies the maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query from ingesters and long-term storage: the total number of actual fetched chunks could be 2x the limit, being independently applied when querying ingesters and long-term storage. #4125\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: allowed to configure the experimental receivers firewall on a per-tenant basis. The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been changed and moved to the limits config section: #4143\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-cidr-networks`\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-private-addresses`\r\n* [CHANGE] Change default value of `-server.grpc.keepalive.min-time-between-pings` from `5m` to `10s` and `-server.grpc.keepalive.ping-without-stream-allowed` to `true`. #4168\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change default value of `-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` to `true`. This incurs a small increase in memory usage, between 1.2% and 1.6% as measured on ingesters with 1.3M active series. #4257\r\n* [CHANGE] Dependency: update go-redis from v8.2.3 to v8.9.0. #4236\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max series per query limit is enforced in the querier and applies to unique series received from ingesters and store-gateway (long-term storage). #4179\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier/Ruler: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max chunk bytes limit is enforced in the querier and ruler and limits the size of all aggregated chunks returned from ingesters and storage as bytes for a query. #4216\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: support negative matchers, time-based muting - [upstream release notes](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.22.0). #4237\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added rate-limits to notifiers. Rate limits used by all integrations can be configured using `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit`, while per-integration rate limits can be specified via `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration` parameter. Both shared and per-integration limits can be overwritten using overrides mechanism. These limits are applied on individual (per-tenant) alertmanagers. Rate-limited notifications are failed notifications. It is possible to monitor rate-limited notifications via new `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total` metric. #4135 #4163\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes` limit to control size of configuration files that Cortex users can upload to Alertmanager via API. This limit is configurable per-tenant. #4201\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-templates-count` and `-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes` options to control number and size of templates uploaded to Alertmanager via API. These limits are configurable per-tenant. #4223\r\n* [FEATURE] Added flag `-debug.block-profile-rate` to enable goroutine blocking events profiling. #4217\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: The experimental sharding feature is now considered complete. Detailed information about the configuration options can be found [here for alertmanager](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) and [here for the alertmanager storage](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_storage_config). To use the feature: #3925 #4020 #4021 #4031 #4084 #4110 #4126 #4127 #4141 #4146 #4161 #4162 #4222\r\n  * Ensure that a remote storage backend is configured for Alertmanager to store state using `-alertmanager-storage.backend`, and flags related to the backend. Note that the `local` and `configdb` storage backends are not supported.\r\n  * Ensure that a ring store is configured using `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store`, and set the flags relevant to the chosen store type.\r\n  * Enable the feature using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`.\r\n  * Note the prior addition of a new configuration option `-alertmanager.persist-interval`. This sets the interval between persisting the current alertmanager state (notification log and silences) to object storage. See the [configuration file reference](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) for more information.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Cleanup persisted state objects from remote storage when a tenant configuration is deleted. #4167\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Added the ability to disable Open Census within GCS client (e.g `-gcs.enable-opencensus=false`). #4219\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Etcd: Added username and password to etcd config. #4205\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: introduced new metrics to monitor operation when using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`: #4149\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_completed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: support ingesting exemplars and querying of exemplars.  Enabled by setting new CLI flag `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-exemplars=<n>` or config option `blocks_storage.tsdb.max_exemplars` to positive value. #4124 #4181\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added distributors ring status section in the admin page. #4151\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added zone-awareness support to alertmanager for use when sharding is enabled. When zone-awareness is enabled, alerts will be replicated across availability zones. #4204\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `tenant_ids` tag to tracing spans #4186\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring, query-frontend: Avoid using automatic private IPs (APIPA) when discovering IP address from the interface during the registration of the instance in the ring, or by query-frontend when used with query-scheduler. APIPA still used as last resort with logging indicating usage. #4032\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: introduced new metrics to aid troubleshooting tombstone convergence: #4231\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones_removed_total`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_messages_to_broadcast_dropped_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups` option to control max number of active dispatcher groups in Alertmanager (per tenant, also overrideable). When the limit is reached, Dispatcher produces log message and increases `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_group_limit_reached_total` metric. #4254\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-alerts-count` and `-alertmanager.max-alerts-size-bytes` to control max number of alerts and total size of alerts that a single user can have in Alertmanager's memory. Adding more alerts will fail with a log message and incrementing `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_insert_limited_total` metric (per-user). These limits can be overrided by using per-tenant overrides. Current values are tracked in `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts` and `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts_size_bytes` metrics. #4253\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` and `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-max-duration` support to store-gateway, to wait for ring stability at startup. #4271\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added `rule_group` label to metrics `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_total` and `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total`. #4121\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added new metrics for tracking total number of queries and push requests sent to ingester, as well as failed queries and push requests. Failures are only counted for internal errors, but not user-errors like limits or invalid query. This is in contrast to existing `cortex_prometheus_rule_evaluation_failures_total`, which is incremented also when query or samples appending fails due to user-errors. #4281\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Added option `-ingester.ignore-series-limit-for-metric-names` with comma-separated list of metric names that will be ignored in max series per metric limit. #4302\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added instrumentation to Redis client, with the following metrics: #3976\r\n  - `cortex_rediscache_request_duration_seconds`\r\n* [BUGFIX] Purger: fix `Invalid null value in condition for column range` caused by `nil` value in range for WriteBatch query. #4128\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed infrequent panic caused by a race condition between TSDB mmap-ed head chunks truncation and queries. #4176\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: fix Alertmanager status page if clustering via gossip is disabled or sharding is enabled. #4184\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix `/ruler/rule_groups` endpoint doesn't work when used with object store. #4182\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Honor the evaluation delay for the `ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` series. #4227\r\n* [BUGFIX] Make multiple Get requests instead of MGet on Redis Cluster. #4056\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix issue where runtime limits erroneously override default limits. #4246\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix startup in single-binary mode when the new `ruler_storage` is used. #4252\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix queries failing with \"at least 1 healthy replica required, could only find 0\" error right after scaling up store-gateways until they're ACTIVE in the ring. #4263\r\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: when blocks sharding is enabled, do not load all blocks in each store-gateway in case of a cold startup, but load only blocks owned by the store-gateway replica. #4271\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fix to setting the default configuration value for `-memberlist.retransmit-factor` when not provided. This should improve propagation delay of the ring state (including, but not limited to, tombstones). Note that if the configuration is already explicitly given, this fix has no effect. #4269\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix issue where samples in a chunk might get skipped by batch iterator. #4218\r\n\r\n## Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: add support for DynamoDB (v9 schema only). #3828\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add Cassandra support. #3795\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: retry failed uploads.

Thanks to all of them! Thanos wouldn't be what it is without all of their effort and time! :heart:  \r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [#4394](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4394) Add error logs to receiver when write request rejected with invalid replica\r\n- [#4403](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4403) UI: Add sorting and filtering to flags page\r\n- [#4299](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4299) Tracing: Add tracing to exemplar APIs.\r\n- [#4327](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4327) Add environment variable substitution to all YAML configuration flags.\r\n- [#4239](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4239) Add penalty based deduplication mode for compactor.\r\n- [#4292](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4292) Receive: Enable exemplars ingestion and querying.\r\n- [#4392](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4392) Tools: Added `--delete-blocks` to bucket rewrite tool to mark the original blocks for deletion after rewriting is done.\r\n- [#3970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3970) Azure: Adds more configuration options for Azure blob storage. This allows for pipeline and reader specific configuration. Implements HTTP transport configuration options. These options allows for more fine-grained control on timeouts and retries. Implements MSI authentication as second method of authentication via a service principal token.\r\n- [#4406](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4406) Tools: Add retention command for applying retention policy on the bucket.\r\n- [#4430](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4430) Compact: Add flag `downsample.concurrency` to specify the concurrency of downsampling blocks.\r\n- [#4231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4231) Receive: Implemented the [receive dual-mode](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/release-0.22/docs/proposals-accepted/202012-receive-split.md). This means that it is now you can run receive as ingester (TSDB only, no hashring awareness), as router (no TSDB, only forwarding mode) and old mode (router + ingester) in one service. Consider splitting functionality if you want to scale your hashring into multiple rings or you want horizontally autoscale your ingester more often.\r\n- [#3678](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3678) UI: add support for new duration format in graph range input.

This release also includes enhancements to improve the user experience and fixes for bugs reported by users and E2E tools. There has been some significant progress made on the alpha features as well. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n- Enhanced [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl/blob/develop/README.md) to provide additional information about OpenEBS storage components like: \r\n  - Block devices managed by OpenEBS  (`kubectl openebs get bd`)\r\n  - Jiva Volumes \r\n  - LVM Local PV Volumes\r\n  - ZFS Local PV Volumes\r\n- Added a new Stateful workload dashboard to [Monitoring helm chart](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) to display the CPU, RAM and Filesystem stats of a given Pod. This dashboard currently supports fetching details for LVM Local PV. In addition new alert rules related to PVC status are supported. \r\n- Enhanced [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) snapshot support by allowing users to configure the size that should be reserved for LVM snapshots. By default, the size reserved for a snapshot is equal to the size of the volume. In cases, where snapshots are created for backup purposes, the snapshots may not require the entire space. This feature helps in creating snapshots on VGs that don't have enough space to reserve full capacity for snapshots. \r\n- Enhanced the way custom topology keys can be specified for [LVM Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv). Prior to this enhancement, LVM driver would load the topology keys from node labels and cache them and if someone modified the labels and missed to restart the driver pods, there could be an impact to volume scheduling. This enhancement requires users to specify the topology key via ENV allowing users to know the current key and if there is a change, requires for a ENV modification that will force a restart of all the drivers.\r\n- [NFS Provisioner](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) has been updated with several new features like:\r\n  - Ability to configure the LeaseTime and GraceTime for the NFS server to tune the restart times\r\n  - Added a prometheus metrics end point to report volume creation and failure events \r\n  - Added a configuration option to allow users to specify the GUID to set on the NFS server to allow non-root applications to access NFS share\r\n  - Allow specifying a different namespace than provisioner namespace to create NFS volume related objects\r\n  - Allow specifying the node affinity for NFS server deployment\r\n- [Rawfile Local PV](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) has been enhanced to support xfs filesystem.\r\n- Enhanced Jiva and cStor CSI drivers to handle split brain condition that could cause the Kubelet to attach the volume on new node while still mounted on disconnected node. The CSI drivers have been enhanced to allow iSCSI login connection only from one node at any given time. \r\n\r\n### Key Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue in Jiva Volume Replica STS keeps crashing due to change in the cluster domain and failed attempts to access the controller.\r\n- Fixed an issue in Jiva Volume that was causing log flooding while fetching volume status using Service DNS. Switched to using controller IP. \r\n- Fixed an issue in ZFS Local Volumes that was causing an intermittent crash of controller pod due erroneously accessing a variable.\r\n- Fixed an issue in Device Local PV causing a crash due to a race condition between creating partition and clearing a partition.\r\n- Several usability fixes to documentation and helm charts for various engines. \r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. \r\n- Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v2.11.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/ugmayastor.html) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 2.11.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 2.11.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.7.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.4.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Jiva](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/jiva.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-hostpath.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/uglocalpv-device.html) 2.11.0 (stable)\r\n  - [cStor](https://docs.openebs.io/docs/next/cstor.html) 2.11.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.5.0 (alpha)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.6.0 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Other notable updates\r\n\r\n- A E2e CI Dashboard is being developed to show the status of pipelines being run on various engines.

The role kubernetes/master has been renamed to kubernetes/control-plane, if using the role kubernetes/master solely on previous Kubespray, it is necessary to update the specified role.\r\n2.

You can enable control plane certificates automatic renewal using `auto_renew_certificates`, or manually use k8s-certs-renew.sh `force_certificate_regeneration` is removed as it was only renewing the api server certs and not all the other ones\r\n5. The inventory group *kube-master* has been renamed to *kube_control_plane*. Please update your inventory file by replacing *kube-master* if continuing to use the existing inventory file.\r\n6.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
