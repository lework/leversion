{"updated_at": "2024-11-19T02:20:35Z", "total": 120, "data": [{"name": "Teleport 17", "tag_name": "v17.0.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/releases/tag/v17.0.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport", "body": "Teleport 17 brings the following new features and improvements:\r\n\r\n- Refreshed web UI\r\n- Modern signature algorithms\r\n- (Preview) AWS IAM Identity Center integration\r\n- Hardware key support for Teleport Connect\r\n- Nested access lists\r\n- Access lists UI/UX improvements\r\n- Signed and notarized macOS assets\r\n- Datadog Incident Management plugin for access requests\r\n- Hosted Microsoft Teams plugin for access requests\r\n- Dynamic registration for Windows desktops\r\n- Support for images in web SSH sessions\r\n- `tbot` CLI updates\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Refreshed Web UI\r\n\r\nWe have updated and improved designs and added a new navigation menu to Teleport\r\n17\u2019s web UI to enhance its usability and scalability.\r\n\r\n#### Modern signature algorithms\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 admins have the option to use elliptic curve cryptography for the\r\nmajority of user, host, and certificate authority key material.\r\n\r\nThis includes Ed25519 SSH keys and ECDSA TLS keys, replacing the RSA keys used\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nNew clusters will leverage [modern signature algorithms](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/17.x/reference/signature-algorithms/) by default. Existing\r\nTeleport clusters will continue to use RSA2048 until a CA rotation is performed.\r\n\r\n#### (Preview) AWS IAM Identity Center integration\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center to allow users to sync and\r\nmanage AWS IC group members via Access Lists.\r\n\r\nSee [documentation guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/17.x/admin-guides/management/guides/aws-iam-identity-center/).\r\n\r\n#### Hardware key support for Teleport Connect\r\n\r\nWe have extended Teleport 17\u2019s support for [hardware-backed private keys](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support/) to\r\nTeleport Connect.\r\n\r\n#### Nested access lists\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 admins and access list owners can add access lists as members in\r\nother access lists.\r\n\r\nSee details in the [documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/17.x/admin-guides/access-controls/access-lists/nested-access-lists/).\r\n\r\n#### Access lists UI/UX improvements\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 web UI has an updated access lists page that will include the new\r\ntable view, improved search and filtering capabilities.\r\n\r\n#### Signed and notarized macOS assets\r\n\r\nStarting from Teleport 17 macOS `teleport.pkg` installer includes signed and\r\nnotarized `tsh.app` and `tctl.app` so downloading a separate tsh.pkg to use\r\nTouch ID is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Teleport 17 event handler and Terraform provider for macOS are also\r\nsigned and notarized.\r\n\r\n#### Datadog Incident Management plugin for access requests\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 supports PagerDuty-like integration with Datadog's [on-call](https://docs.datadoghq.com/service_management/on-call/)\r\nand [incident management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/service_management/incident_management/)\r\nAPIs for access request notifications.\r\n\r\nSee the [configuration guide](https://goteleport.com/docs/ver/17.x/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/datadog-hosted/).\r\n\r\n#### Hosted Microsoft Teams plugin for access requests\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 adds support for Microsoft Teams integration for access request\r\nnotifications using Teleport web UI without needing to self-host the plugin.\r\n\r\n#### Dynamic registration for Windows desktops\r\n\r\nDynamic registration allows Teleport administrators to register new Windows\r\ndesktops without having to update the static configuration files read by\r\nTeleport Windows Desktop Service instances.\r\n\r\n#### Support for images in web SSH sessions\r\n\r\nThe SSH console in Teleport\u2019s web UI includes support for rendering images via\r\nboth the SIXEL and iTerm Inline Image Protocol (IIP).\r\n\r\n#### tbot CLI updates\r\n\r\nThe `tbot` client now supports starting most outputs and services directly from\r\nthe command line with no need for a configuration file using the new\r\n`tbot start <mode>` family of commands. If desired, a given command can be\r\nconverted to a YAML configuration file with `tbot configure <mode>`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `tctl` now supports inspection and management of bot instances using\r\nthe `tctl bots instances` family of commands. This allows onboarding of new\r\ninstances for existing bots with `tctl bots instances add`, and inspection of\r\nexisting instances with `tctl bots instances list`.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes and deprecations\r\n\r\n#### macOS assets\r\n\r\nStarting with version 17, Teleport no longer provides a separate `tsh.pkg` macOS\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nInstead, `teleport.pkg` and all macOS tarballs include signed and notarized\r\n`tsh.app` and `tctl.app`.\r\n\r\n#### Enforced stricter requirements for SSH hostnames\r\n\r\nHostnames are only allowed if they are less than 257 characters and consist of\r\nonly alphanumeric characters and the symbols `.` and `-`.\r\n\r\nAny hostname that violates the new restrictions will be changed, the original\r\nhostname will be moved to the `teleport.internal/invalid-hostname` label for\r\ndiscoverability.\r\n\r\nAny Teleport agents with an invalid hostname will be replaced with the host UUID.\r\nAny Agentless OpenSSH Servers with an invalid hostname will be replaced with\r\nthe host of the address, if it is valid, or a randomly generated identifier.\r\nAny hosts with invalid hostnames should be updated to comply with the new\r\nrequirements to avoid Teleport renaming them.\r\n\r\n#### `TELEPORT_ALLOW_NO_SECOND_FACTOR` removed\r\n\r\nAs of Teleport 16, multi-factor authentication is required for local users. To\r\nassist with upgrades, Teleport 16 included a temporary opt-out mechanism via the\r\n`TELEPORT_ALLOW_NO_SECOND_FACTOR` environment variable. This opt-out mechanism\r\nhas been removed.\r\n\r\n#### TOTP for per-session MFA\r\n\r\nTeleport 17 is the last release where `tsh` will allow for using TOTP with\r\nper-session MFA. Starting with Teleport 18, `tsh` will require a strong webauthn\r\ncredential for per-session MFA.\r\n\r\nTOTP will continue to be accepted for the initial login.", "created_at": "2024-11-16T07:35:23Z", "project": "Teleport", "repo": "gravitational/teleport", "type": "DevOps", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.106.1", "tag_name": "v1.106.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.106.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "## [v1.106.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.106.1)\r\n\r\nReleased at 2024-11-15\r\n\r\n* SECURITY: upgrade Go builder from Go1.23.1 to Go1.23.3.

As this marks the first new major version in seven years, several breaking changes are introduced. The breaking changes are mainly around the removal of deprecated feature flags and CLI arguments, and the full list can be found below. For users that want to upgrade we recommend to read through our [migration guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/).\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Set the `GOMAXPROCS` variable automatically to match the Linux CPU quota. Use `--no-auto-gomaxprocs` to disable it. The `auto-gomaxprocs` feature flag was removed. #15376\r\n* [CHANGE] Set the `GOMEMLIMIT` variable automatically to match the Linux container memory limit. Use `--no-auto-gomemlimit` to disable it. The `auto-gomemlimit` feature flag was removed. #15373\r\n* [CHANGE] Scraping: Remove implicit fallback to the Prometheus text format in case of invalid/missing Content-Type and fail the scrape instead. Add ability to specify a `fallback_scrape_protocol` in the scrape config. #15136\r\n* [CHANGE] Remote-write: default enable_http2 to false. #15219\r\n* [CHANGE] Scraping: normalize \"le\" and \"quantile\" label values upon ingestion. #15164\r\n* [CHANGE] Scraping: config `scrape_classic_histograms` was renamed to `always_scrape_classic_histograms`. #15178\r\n* [CHANGE] Config: remove expand-external-labels flag, expand external labels env vars by default. #14657\r\n* [CHANGE] Disallow configuring AM with the v1 api. #13883\r\n* [CHANGE] regexp `.` now matches all characters (performance improvement). #14505\r\n* [CHANGE] `holt_winters` is now called `double_exponential_smoothing` and moves behind the [experimental-promql-functions feature flag](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#experimental-promql-functions). #14930\r\n* [CHANGE] API: The OTLP receiver endpoint can now be enabled using `--web.enable-otlp-receiver` instead of `--enable-feature=otlp-write-receiver`. #14894\r\n* [CHANGE] Prometheus will not add or remove port numbers from the target address. `no-default-scrape-port` feature flag removed. #14160\r\n* [CHANGE] Logging: the format of log lines has changed a little, along with the adoption of Go's Structured Logging package. #14906\r\n* [CHANGE] Don't create extra `_created` timeseries if feature-flag `created-timestamp-zero-ingestion` is enabled. #14738\r\n* [CHANGE] Float literals and time durations being the same is now a stable fetaure. #15111\r\n* [CHANGE] UI: The old web UI has been replaced by a completely new one that is less cluttered and adds a few new features (PromLens-style tree view, better metrics explorer, \"Explain\" tab). However, it is still missing some features of the old UI (notably, exemplar display and heatmaps). To switch back to the old UI, you can use the feature flag `--enable-feature=old-ui` for the time being. #14872\r\n* [CHANGE] PromQL: Range selectors and the lookback delta are now left-open, i.e. a sample coinciding with the lower time limit is excluded rather than included. #13904\r\n* [CHANGE] Kubernetes SD: Remove support for `discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1` API version of EndpointSlice. This version is no longer served as of Kubernetes v1.25. #14365\r\n* [CHANGE] Kubernetes SD: Remove support for `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API version of Ingress. This version is no longer served as of Kubernetes v1.22. #14365\r\n* [CHANGE] UTF-8: Enable UTF-8 support by default. Prometheus now allows all UTF-8 characters in metric and label names. The corresponding `utf8-name` feature flag has been removed. #14705\r\n* [CHANGE] Console: Remove example files for the console feature. Users can continue using the console feature by supplying their own JavaScript and templates. #14807\r\n* [CHANGE] SD: Enable the new service discovery manager by default. This SD manager does not restart unchanged discoveries upon reloading. This makes reloads faster and reduces pressure on service discoveries' sources. The corresponding `new-service-discovery-manager` feature flag has been removed. #14770\r\n* [CHANGE] Agent mode has been promoted to stable. The feature flag `agent` has been removed. To run Prometheus in Agent mode, use the new `--agent` cmdline arg instead. #14747\r\n* [CHANGE] Remove deprecated `remote-write-receiver`,`promql-at-modifier`, and `promql-negative-offset` feature flags. #13456, #14526\r\n* [CHANGE] Remove deprecated `storage.tsdb.allow-overlapping-blocks`, `alertmanager.timeout`, and `storage.tsdb.retention` flags. #14640, #14643\r\n* [FEATURE] OTLP receiver: Ability to skip UTF-8 normalization using `otlp.translation_strategy = NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes` configuration option. #15384\r\n* [FEATURE] Support config reload automatically - feature flag `auto-reload-config`. #14769\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping, rules: handle targets reappearing, or rules moving group, when out-of-order is enabled. #14710\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Tools: add debug printouts

The `podman kube play` command uses this information to duplicate the user namespace configuration when creating new pods based on the YAML.\r\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports Kubernetes volumes of type image ([#23775](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23775)).\r\n- The service name of systemd units generated by Quadlet can now be set with the `ServiceName` key in all supported Quadlet files ([#23414](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23414)).\r\n- Quadlets can now disable their implicit dependency on `network-online.target` via a new key, `DefaultDependencies`, supported by all Quadlet files ([#24193](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24193)).\r\n- Quadlet `.container` and `.pod` files now support a new key, `AddHost`, to add hosts to the container or pod.\r\n- The `PublishPort` key in Quadlet `.container` and `.pod` files can now accept variables in its value ([#24081](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24081)).\r\n- Quadlet `.container` files now support two new keys, `CgroupsMode` and `StartWithPod`, to configure cgroups for the container and whether the container will be started with the pod it is part of ([#23664](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23664) and [#24401](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24401)).\r\n- Quadlet `.container` files can now use the network of another container by specifying the `.container` file of the container to share with in the `Network` key.\r\n- Quadlet `.container` files can now mount images managed by `.image` files into the container by using the `Mount=type=image` key with a `.image` target.\r\n- Quadlet `.pod` files now support six new keys, `DNS`, `DNSOption`, `DNSSearch`, `IP`, `IP6`, and `UserNS`, to configure DNS, static IPs, and user namespace settings for the pod ([#23692](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23692)).\r\n- Quadlet `.image` files can now give an image multiple times by specifying the `ImageTag` key multiple times ([#23781](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23781)).\r\n- Quadlets can now be placed in the `/run/containers/systemd` directory as well as existing directories like `$HOME/containers/systemd` and `/etc/containers/systemd/users`.\r\n- Quadlet now properly handles subdirectories of a unit directory being a symlink ([#23755](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23755)).\r\n- The `podman manifest inspect` command now includes the manifest's annotations in its output.\r\n- The output of the `podman inspect` command for containers now includes a new field, `HostConfig.AutoRemoveImage`, which shows whether a container was created with the `--rmi` option set.\r\n- The output of the `podman inspect` command for containers now includes a new field, `Config.ExposedPorts`, which includes all exposed ports from the container, improving Docker compatibility.\r\n- The output of the `podman inspect` command for containers now includes a new field, `Config.StartupHealthCheck`, which shows the container's startup healthcheck configuration.\r\n- The output of the `podman inspect` command for containers now includes a new field in `Mounts`, `SubPath`, which contains any subpath set for image or named volumes.\r\n- The `podman machine list` command now supports a new option, `--all-providers`, which lists machines from all supported VM providers, not just the one currently in use.\r\n- VMs run by `podman machine` on Windows will now provide API access by exposing a Unix socket on the host filesystem which forwards into the VM ([#23408](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23408)).\r\n- The `podman buildx prune` and `podman image prune` commands now support a new option, `--build-cache`, which will also clean the build cache.\r\n- The Windows installer has a new radio button to select virtualization provider (WSLv2 or Hyper-V).\r\n- The `--add-host` option to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` now supports specifying multiple hostnames, semicolon-separated (e.g. `podman run --add-host test1;test2:192.168.1.1`) ([#23770](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23770)).\r\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now support three new options for configuring healthcheck logging: `--health-log-destination` (specify where logs are stored), `--health-max-log-count` (specify how many healthchecks worth of logs are stored), and `--health-max-log-size` (specify the maximum size of the healthcheck log).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Podman now uses the Pasta `--map-guest-addr` option by default which is used for the `host.containers.internal` entry in `/etc/hosts` to allow containers to reach the host by default ([#19213](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19213)).\r\n- The names of the infra containers of pods created by Quadlet are changed to the pod name suffixed with `-infra` ([#23665](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23665)).\r\n- The `podman system connection add` command now respects HTTP path prefixes specified with `tcp://` URLs.\r\n- Proxy environment variables (e.g. `https_proxy`) declared in `containers.conf` no longer escape special characters in their values when used with `podman machine` VMs ([#23277](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23277)).\r\n- The `podman images --sort=repository` command now also sorts by image tag as well, guaranteeing deterministic output ordering ([#23803](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23803)).\r\n- When a user has a rootless `podman machine` VM running and second rootful `podman machine` VM initialized, and the rootless VM is removed, the connection to the second, rootful machine now becomes the default as expected ([#22577](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22577)).\r\n- Environment variable secrets are no longer contained in the output of `podman inspect` on a container the secret is used in ([#23788](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23788)).\r\n- Podman no longer exits 0 on SIGTERM by default.\r\n- Podman no longer explicitly sets rlimits to their default value, as this could lower the actual value available to containers if it had been set higher previously.\r\n- Quadlet user units now correctly wait for the network to be ready to use via a new service, `podman-user-wait-network-online.service`, instead of the user session's nonfunctional `network-online.target`.\r\n- Exposed ports in the output of `podman ps` are now correctly grouped and deduplicated when they are also published ([#23317](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23317)).\r\n- Quadlet build units no longer use `RemainAfterExit=yes` by default.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--build-context` option to `podman build` did not function properly on Windows, breaking compatibility with Visual Studio Dev Containers ([#17313](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/17313)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet would generate bad arguments to Podman if the `SecurityLabelDisable` or `SecurityLabelNested` keys were used ([#23432](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23432)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `PODMAN_COMPOSE_WARNING_LOGS` environment variable did not suppress warnings printed by `podman compose` that it was redirecting to an external provider.\r\n- Fixed a bug where, if the `podman container cleanup` command was run on a container in the process of being removed, an error could be printed.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Quadlet units placed in `/etc/containers/systemd/users/` would be loaded for root as well when `/etc/containers/systemd` was a symlink ([#23483](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23483)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman stop` command would, if called with `--cidfile` pointing to a non-existent file and the `--ignore` option set, stop all containers ([#23554](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23554)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman wait` would only exit only after 20 second when run on a container which rapidly exits and is then restarted by the `on-failure` restart policy.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman volume rm` and `podman run -v` could deadlock when run simultaneously on the same volume ([#23613](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23613)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where running `podman mount` on a container in the process of being created could cause a nonsensical error indicating the container already existed ([#23637](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23637)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stop` command could deadlock when run on containers with very large annotations ([#22246](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22246)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine stop` command could segfault on Mac when a VM failed to stop gracefully ([#23654](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23654)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stop` command would not ensure containers created with `--rm` were removed when it exited ([#22852](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/22852)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--rmi` option to `podman run` did not function correctly with detached containers.\r\n- Fixed a bug where running `podman inspect` on a container on FreeBSD would emit an incorrect value for the `HostConfig.Device` field, breaking compatibility with the Ansible Podman module.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to start containers using the `--cgroup-parent` option ([#23780](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23780)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman build -v` command did not properly handle Windows paths passed as the host directory.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could leak network namespace files if it was interrupted while creating a network namespace ([#24044](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24044)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run` command could sometimes fail to retrieve a container's exit code for containers run with the `--rm` option.\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman machine` on Windows could fail to run VMs for certain usernames containing special characters.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Quadlet would reject `RemapUsers=keep-id` when run as root.\r\n- Fixed a bug where XFS quotas on volumes were not unique, meaning that all volumes using a quota shared the same maximum size and inodes (set by the most recent volume with a quota to be created).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `Service` section of Quadlet files would only use defaults and not respect user input ([#24322](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24322)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where `podman volume ls` would sometimes fail when a volume was removed at the same time it was run.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--tz=local` option could not be used when the `TZDIR` environment variable was set.\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Play API for Kubernetes YAML now supports `application/x-tar` compressed context directories ([#24015](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/24015)).\r\n- Fixed a bug in the Attach API for Containers (for both Compat and Libpod endpoints) which could cause inconsistent failures due to a race condition ([#23757](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23757)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the output for the Compat Top API for Containers did not properly split the output into an array ([#23981](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23981)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Info API could fail when running `podman system service` via a socket-activated systemd service ([#24152](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/24152)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Events and Logs endpoints for Containers now send status codes immediately, as opposed to when the first event or log line is sent ([#23712](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23712)).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Podman now requires Golang 1.22 or higher to build.\r\n- The output of `podman machine start` has been improved when trying to start a machine when another is already running ([#23436](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23436)).\r\n- Quadlet will no longer log spurious ENOENT errors when resolving unit directories ([#23620](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/23620)).\r\n- The Docker alias shell script will now also honor the presence of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/nodocker` when considering whether it should print its warning message that Podman is in use.\r\n- The podman-auto-update systemd unit files have been moved into the `contrib/systemd/system` directory in the repo for consistency with our other unit files.\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.38.0\r\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.61.0\r\n- Updated the

This removes the time spent converting raw data values to AST\r\nduring policy evaluation, thereby improving performance.\r\n\r\nThe memory footprint of the store will increase, as processed AST values generally take up more space in memory than the\r\ncorresponding raw data values, but overall memory usage of OPA might remain more stable over time, as pre-converted data\r\nis shared across evaluations and isn't recomputed for each evaluation, which can cause spikes in memory usage.\r\n\r\nThis mode can be enabled for `opa run`, `opa eval`, and `opa bench` by setting the `--optimize-store-for-read-speed` flag.\r\n\r\nMore information about this feature can be found [here](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.70.0/policy-performance/#storage-optimization).\r\n\r\nCo-authored by @johanfylling and @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n- topdown: Use new Inter-Query Value Cache for `json.match_schema` built-in function ([#7011](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7011)) authored by @anderseknert reported by @lcarva\r\n- ast: Fix location text attribute for multi-value rules with generated body  ([#7128](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7128)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- ast: Fix regression in `opa check` where a file that referenced non-provided schemas failed validation ([#7124](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7124)) authored by @tjons\r\n- test/cases/testdata: Fix bug in test by replacing unification by explicit equality check ([#7093](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7093)) authored by @matajoh\r\n- ast: Replace use of yaml.v2 library with yaml.v3. The earlier version would parse `yes`/`no` values as boolean. The usage of yaml.v2 in the parser was unintentional and now has been updated to yaml.v3 ([#7090](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7090)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n- cmd: Make `opa check` respect `--ignore` when `--bundle` flag is set ([#7136](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7136)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- server/writer: Properly handle result encoding errors which earlier on failure would emit logs such as `superfluous call to WriteHeader()` while still returning `200` HTTP status code.

When\ntraffic mirroring is enabled, VTGate will mirror a percentage of traffic from one keyspace to another.\n\nMirror rules may be enabled through `vtctldclient` with `MoveTables MirrorTraffic`. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ vtctldclient --server :15999 MoveTables --target-keyspace customer --workflow commerce2customer MirrorTraffic --percent 5.0\n```\n\nMirror rules can be inspected with `GetMirrorRules`.\n\n### <a id=\"atomic-transaction\"/>Atomic Distributed Transaction Support</a>\n\nWe have introduced atomic distributed transactions as an experimental feature.\nUsers can now run multi-shard transactions with stronger guarantees. \nVitess now provides two modes of transactional guarantees for multi-shard transactions: Best Effort and Atomic. \nThese can be selected based on the user\u2019s requirements and the trade-offs they are willing to make.\n\nFollow the documentation to enable [Atomic Distributed Transaction](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/features/distributed-transaction/)\n\nFor more details on the implementation and trade-offs, please refer to the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/16245)\n\n### <a id=\"new-vtgate-shutdown-behavior\"/>New VTGate Shutdown Behavior</a>\n\nWe added a new option to VTGate to disallow new connections while VTGate is shutting down,\nwhile allowing existing connections to finish their work until they manually disconnect or until\nthe `--onterm_timeout` is reached, without getting a `Server shutdown in progress` error.\n\nThis new behavior can be enabled by specifying the new `--mysql-server-drain-onterm` flag to VTGate.\n\nYou can find more information about this option in the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15971).\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet Throttler: Multi-Metric support</a>\n\nUp until `v20`, the tablet throttler would only monitor and use a single metric. That would be replication lag, by\ndefault, or could be the result of a custom query. In this release, we introduce a major redesign so that the throttler \nmonitors and uses multiple metrics at the same time, including the above two.\n\nThe default behavior now is to monitor all metrics, but only use `lag` (if the custom query is undefined) or the `custom` \nmetric (if the custom query is defined). This is backwards-compatible with `v20`. A `v20` `PRIMARY` is compatible with\na `v21` `REPLICA`, and a `v21` `PRIMARY` is compatible with a `v20` `REPLICA`.\n\nHowever, it is now possible to assign any combination of one or more metrics for a given app. The throttler\nwould then accept or reject the app's requests based on the health of _all_ assigned metrics. We have provided a pre-defined\nlist of metrics:\n\n- `lag`: replication lag based on heartbeat injection.\n- `threads_running`: concurrent active threads on the MySQL server.\n- `loadavg`: per core load average measured on the tablet instance/pod.\n- `custom`: the result of a custom query executed on the MySQL server.\n\nEach metric has a default threshold which can be overridden by the `UpdateThrottlerConfig` command.\n\nThe throttler also supports the catch-all `\"all\"` app name, and it is thus possible to assign metrics to **all** apps.\nExplicit app to metric assignments will override the catch-all configuration.\n\nMetrics are assigned a default _scope_, which could be `self` (isolated to the tablet) or `shard` (max, aka **worst**\nvalue among shard tablets). It is further possible to require a different scope for each metric.\n\n### <a id=\"allow-cross-cell\"/>Allow Cross Cell Promotion in PRS</a>\n\nUp until now if the users wanted to promote a replica in a different cell from the current primary\nusing `PlannedReparentShard`, they had to specify the new primary with the `--new-primary` flag.\n\nWe have now added a new flag `--allow-cross-cell-promotion` that lets `PlannedReparentShard` choose a primary in a\ndifferent cell even if no new primary is provided explicitly.\n\n### <a id=\"recursive-cte\"/>Experimental support for recursive CTEs</a>\n\nWe have added experimental support for recursive CTEs in Vitess. We are marking it as experimental because it is not yet\nfully tested and may have some limitations. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-balancer\"/>VTGate Tablet Balancer</a>\n\nWhen a VTGate routes a query and has multiple available tablets for a given shard / tablet type (e.g. REPLICA), the\ncurrent default behavior routes the query with local cell affinity and round robin policy. The VTGate Tablet Balancer\nprovides an alternate mechanism that routes queries to maintain an even distribution of query load to each tablet, while\npreferentially routing to tablets in the same cell as the VTGate.\n\nThe tablet balancer is enabled by a new flag `--enable-balancer` and configured by `--balancer-vtgate-cells`\nand `--balancer-keyspaces`.\n\nSee the [RFC ](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12241) for more details on the design and configuration of this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout Override</a>\n\nVTGate sends an authoritative query timeout to VTTablet when the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive,\n`query_timeout` session system variable, or `query-timeout` flag is set.\nThe order of precedence is: comment directive > session variable > VTGate flag.\nVTTablet overrides its default query timeout with the value received from VTGate.\nAll timeouts are specified in milliseconds.\n\nWhen a query is executed inside a transaction, there is an additional nuance. The actual timeout used will be the smaller \nof the transaction timeout and the query timeout.\n\nA query can also be set to have no timeout by using the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive with a value of `0`.\n\nExample usage:\n`select /*vt+ QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30 */ col from tbl`\n\n### <a id=\"new-backup-engine\"/>New Backup Engine (EXPERIMENTAL)</a>\n\nWe are introducing a new backup engine for logical backups in order to support use cases that require something other \nthan physical backups. This feature is experimental and is based on [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/).\n\nThe new engine is enabled by using `--backup_engine_implementation=mysqlshell`. There are other options that are required, \nso please read the [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/) to learn which options are required and how to configure them.\n\n### <a id=\"dynamic-vreplication-configuration\"/>Dynamic VReplication Configuration</a>\n\nPreviously, many of the configuration options for VReplication Workflows had to be provided using VTTablet flags. This \nmeant that any change to VReplication configuration required restarting VTTablets. We now allow these to be overridden \nwhile creating a workflow or dynamically after the workflow is already in progress.\n\n### <a id=\"reference-table-materialization\"/>Reference Table Materialization</a>\n\nThere is a new option in [`Materialize` workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/materialize/) to keep a synced copy of [reference or lookup tables](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/reference_tables/) \n(countries, states, zip codes, etc) from an unsharded keyspace, which holds the source of truth for the reference \ntable, to all shards in a sharded keyspace.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vexplain-modes\"/>New VEXPLAIN Modes: TRACE and KEYS</a>\n\n#### VEXPLAIN TRACE\n\nThe new `TRACE` mode for `VEXPLAIN` provides a detailed execution trace of queries, showing how they're processed through various \noperators and interactions with tablets. This mode is particularly useful for:\n\n- Identifying performance bottlenecks\n- Understanding query execution patterns\n- Optimizing complex queries\n- Debugging unexpected query behavior\n\n`TRACE` mode runs the query and logs all interactions, returning a JSON representation of the query execution plan with additional \nstatistics like number of calls, average rows processed, and number of shards queried.\n\n#### VEXPLAIN KEYS\n\nThe `KEYS` mode for `VEXPLAIN` offers a concise summary of query structure, highlighting columns used in joins, filters, and \ngrouping operations. This information is crucial for:\n\n- Identifying potential sharding key candidates\n- Optimizing query performance\n- Analyzing query patterns to inform database design decisions\n\n`KEYS` mode analyzes the query structure without executing it, providing JSON output that includes grouping columns, join columns, \nfilter columns (potential candidates for indexes, primary keys, or sharding keys), and the statement type.\n\nThese new `VEXPLAIN` modes enhance Vitess's query analysis capabilities, allowing for more informed decisions about sharding \nstrategies and query optimization.\n\n### <a id=\"auto-replace-mysql-autoinc-with-seq\"/>Automatically Replace MySQL auto_increment Clauses with Vitess Sequences</a>\n\nIn https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/16860 we added support for replacing MySQL `auto_increment` clauses with [Vitess Sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/), performing all of the setup and initialization\nwork automatically during the [`MoveTables`](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/movetables/) workflow. As part of that work we have deprecated the\n[`--remove-sharded-auto-increment` boolean flag](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and you should begin using the new\n[`--sharded-auto-increment-handling` flag](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) instead. Please see the new\n[`MoveTables` Auto Increment Handling](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/vreplication/movetables/#auto-increment-handling) documentation for additional details.\n\n### <a id=\"experimental-mysql-84\"/>Experimental MySQL 8.4 support\n\nWe have added experimental support for MySQL 8.4. It passes the Vitess test suite, but it is otherwise not yet tested. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this to move support out of the experimental phase in a future release.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-metric\"/>Current Errant GTIDs Count Metric\nA new metric called `CurrentErrantGTIDCount` has been added to the `VTOrc` component. \nThis metric shows the current count of the errant GTIDs in the tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"vtctldclient-changetablettags\"/>`vtctldclient ChangeTabletTags` command\n\nThe `vtctldclient` command `ChangeTabletTags` was added to allow the tags of a tablet to be changed dynamically.\n\n### <a id=\"reparents-expectedprimary\"/>Support specifying expected primary in reparents\n\nThe `EmergencyReparentShard` and `PlannedReparentShard` commands and RPCs now support specifying a primary we expect to still be the current primary in order for a reparent operation to be processed. This allows reparents to be conditional on a specific state being true.\n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/21.0/21.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 364 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @Utkar5hM, @anshikavashistha, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @cameronmccord2, @chrism1001, @cuishuang, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @harshitasao, @icyflame, @kirtanchandak, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @maxenglander, @mcrauwel, @notfelineit, @perminov, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @runewake2, @rvrangel, @shanth96, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot\n\n", "created_at": "2024-10-29T05:08:48Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "RabbitMQ 4.0.3", "tag_name": "v4.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "body": "RabbitMQ `4.0.3` is a maintenance release in the `4.0.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).\r\n\r\nStarting June 1st, 2024, community support for this series will only be provided to [regularly contributing users](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) and those\r\nwho hold a valid [commercial support license](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).\r\n\r\nIt is **strongly recommended** that you read [4.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1)\r\nin detail if upgrading from a version prior to `4.0.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimum Supported Erlang Version\r\n\r\nThis release requires Erlang 26 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.2.x`.\r\n[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on\r\nErlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\nNodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v4.0.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n### Core Broker\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Classic queues could run into an exception.\r\n\r\n   Kudos to @netrmqdev for helping the core team reproduce this rare behavior.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12367](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/12367)\r\n\r\n * [Continuous membership reconciliation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues#replica-reconciliation) of quorum queues did not propagate a timeout error.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @SimonUnge.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12578](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12578)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues could truncate the log too aggresively (by one entry too many).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12358](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12358)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues failed to requeue a message with a specific workload where consumers\r\n   requeued a delivery and then immediately cancelled themselves.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#12442](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12442)\r\n\r\n * When a quorum queue was forced to shrink, it did not stop the replicas on the nodes that were\r\n   removed from the list of replicas.

For more information, see [CVE-2024-22036](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc).\r\n- Improvements have been made to binaries and configuration files that are known to be executed by administrative accounts to prevent the possibility of privilege escalation. The binaries and configuration files now have stricter ACLs so that only Administrators can amend the files. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32197](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-7h8m-pvw3-5gh4).\r\n- To avoid credentials being stored in plain-text within the vSphere add-on config when creating a vSphere Rancher HA setup, the `provisioningprebootstrap` feature was added. For more information, see [CVE-2022-45157](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-xj7w-r753-vj8v).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the Security Advisories and CVEs page in Rancher's [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/reference-guides/rancher-security/security-advisories-and-cves) or in Rancher's [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories) repo.\r\n\r\n## Rancher UI\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n<!-- Add Summary -->\r\n- The performance of the Clusters list on the **Home** page and the Side Menu has greatly improved when there are hundreds of clusters. See [#11999](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11999) and [#12009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12009).\r\n\r\n## Harvester\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- On the Cloud Credential list, you can now easily see if a Harvester Credential is about to expire or has expired and choose to renew it. You will also be notified on the Cluster Management Clusters list when an associated Harvester Cloud Credential is about to expire or has expired. When upgrading, an existing expired Harvester Credential will not contain a warning. You can still renew the token on the resources menu. See [#11270](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11270).\r\n\r\n## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue where multiple, stale secrets may be erroneously created for users on downstream clusters. See [#46894](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46894).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and  issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n**Important:** With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, we are informing customers that RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\nPlease note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or k3s.\r\n\r\nRKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming [here](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.9.3\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.9.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.9.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.6.3](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.6.3)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE\r\n\r\n- v1.30.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.9\r\n- v1.28.14\r\n- v1.27.16\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.30.5 (Default)\r\n- v1.29.9\r\n- v1.28.14\r\n- v1.27.16\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancher now supports the ability to use an OCI Helm chart registry for Apps & Marketplace. View documentation on [using OCI based Helm chart repositories](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/oci-repositories) and note this feature is in an experimental stage. See [#29105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29105) and [#45062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45062)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Upstream Projects\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Microsoft deprecated the Azure AD Graph API that Rancher had been using for authentication via Azure AD. When updating Rancher, update the configuration to make sure that users can still use Rancher with Azure AD. See [the documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/authentication-config/configure-azure-ad#migrating-from-azure-ad-graph-api-to-microsoft-graph-api) and issue [#29306](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29306) for details.\r\n\r\n## Removed Legacy Features\r\n\r\nApps functionality in the cluster manager has been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line. This functionality has been replaced by the **Apps & Marketplace** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rancher-external-dns` and `rancher-global-dns` have been deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features have been removed as of Rancher v2.7.0. The deprecation and removal of these features was announced in previous releases. See [#6864](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/6864).\r\n\r\n**UI and Backend**\r\n\r\n- CIS Scans v1 (Cluster)\r\n- Pipelines (Project)\r\n- Istio v1 (Project)\r\n- Logging v1 (Project)\r\n- RancherD\r\n\r\n**UI**\r\n\r\n- Multiclusterapps (Global): Apps within the **Multicluster Apps** section of the Rancher UI.\r\n\r\n# Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Previous Rancher Behavior Changes\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.25 and v1.26 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.9.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#45882](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45882).\r\n  - The `external-rules` [feature flag](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/feature-flags) functionality is removed in Rancher v2.9.0 as the behavior is enabled by default. The feature flag is [still present](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46272) when upgrading from v2.8.5; however, enabling or disabling the feature won't have any effect. For more information, see [CVE-2023-32196](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-64jq-m7rq-768h) and [#45863](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45863).\r\n  - Rancher now validates the Container Default Resource Limit on Projects. Validation mimics the upstream behavior of the Kubernetes API server when it validates LimitRanges. The container default resource configuration must have properly formatted quantities for all requests and limits. Limits for any resource must not be less than requests. See [#39700](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39700).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - The controller now cleans up instances of `ClusterUserAttribute` that have no corresponding `UserAttribute`. See [#44985](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44985).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - When Rancher starts, it now identifies all deprecated and unrecognized setting resources and adds a `cattle.io/unknown` label. You can list these settings with the command `kubectl get settings -l 'cattle.io/unknown==true'`. In Rancher v2.9 and later, these settings will be removed instead. See [#43992](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43992).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher Compose is no longer supported, and all parts of it are being removed in the v2.8 release line. See [#43341](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43341).\r\n  - Kubernetes v1.23 and v1.24 are no longer supported. Before you upgrade to Rancher v2.8.0, make sure that all clusters are running Kubernetes v1.25 or later. See [#42828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42828).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - Docker CLI 20.x is at end-of-life and no longer supported in Rancher. Please update your local Docker CLI versions to 23.0.x or later. Earlier versions may not recognize OCI compliant Rancher image manifests. See [#45424](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45424).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Kontainer Engine v1 (KEv1) provisioning and the respective cluster drivers are now deprecated. KEv1 provided plug-ins for different targets using cluster drivers. The Rancher-maintained cluster drivers for EKS, GKE and AKS have been replaced by the hosted provider drivers, EKS-Operator, GKE-Operator and AKS-Operator. Node drivers are now available for self-managed Kubernetes.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When you provision a downstream cluster, the cluster's name must conform to [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123). Previously, characters that did not follow the specification, such as `.`, were permitted and would result in clusters being provisioned without the necessary Fleet components. See [#39248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39248).\r\n  - Privilege escalation is disabled by default when creating deployments from the Rancher API. See [#7165](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/7165).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - With the release of Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) v1.6.0, RKE is now deprecated. RKE will be maintained for two more versions, following our [deprecation policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).\r\n\r\n    Please note, End-of-Life (EOL) for RKE is July 31st, 2025. Prime customers must re-platform from RKE to RKE2 or K3s.\r\n\r\n    RKE2 and K3s provide stronger security, and move away from the upstream-deprecated Docker machine. Learn more about re-platforming at the official [SUSE blog](https://www.suse.com/c/rke-end-of-life-by-july-2025-replatform-to-rke2-or-k3s/).\r\n  - Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44857](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44857).\r\n  - Weave CNI support for RKE clusters is removed in response to Weave CNI not being supported by upstream Kubernetes v1.30 and later. See [#45954](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45954)\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke1) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#43175](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43175).\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated. Weave will be removed in RKE v1.30. See [#42730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42730).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2:**\r\n  - Fixed an issue where downstream RKE2 clusters may become corrupted if KDM data (from `rke-metadata-config` setting) is invalid. Note that per the fix these clusters' status may change to \"Updating\" with a message indicating KDM data is missing instead of the cluster status stating \"Active\". See [#46855](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46855).\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Rancher has added support for external Azure cloud providers in downstream RKE2 clusters. Note that [migration to an external Azure cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/migrate-to-an-out-of-tree-cloud-provider/migrate-to-out-of-tree-azure) is **required** when running Kubernetes v1.30 and **recommended** when running Kubernetes v1.29. See [#44856](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44856).\r\n  - Added a new annotation, `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop`. When set to `true`, it drops the `dynamicSchemaSpec` field from machine pool definitions. This prevents cluster nodes from re-provisioning unintentionally when the cluster object is updated from an external source such as Terraform or Fleet. See [#44618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44618).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer supports the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in-tree cloud provider for RKE2 clusters. This is in response to upstream Kubernetes removing the in-tree AWS provider in Kubernetes v1.27. You should instead [use the out-of-tree AWS cloud provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/kubernetes-clusters-in-rancher-setup/set-up-cloud-providers/amazon#using-the-out-of-tree-aws-cloud-provider-for-rke2) for any Rancher-managed clusters running Kubernetes v1.27 or later. See [#42749](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42749).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Cluster API <!-- highlander -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The `cluster-api` core provider controllers run in a pod in the `cattle-provisioning-cattle-system` namespace, within the local cluster. These controllers are installed with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/rancher/provisioning). Previously, Rancher ran `cluster-api` controllers in an embedded fashion. This change makes it easier to maintain `cluster-api` versioning. See [#41094](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41094).\r\n  - The token hashing algorithm generates new tokens using SHA3. Existing tokens that don't use SHA3 won't be re-hashed. This change affects ClusterAuthTokens (the downstream synced version of tokens for ACE) and Tokens (only when token hashing is enabled). SHA3 tokens should work with ACE and Token Hashing. Tokens that don't use SHA3 may not work when ACE and token hashing are used in combination. If, after upgrading to Rancher v2.7.7, you experience issues with ACE while token hashing is enabled, re-generate any applicable tokens. See [#42062](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/42062).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The built-in `restricted-admin` role is being deprecated in favor of a more flexible global role configuration, which is now available for different use cases other than only the `restricted-admin`. If you want to replicate the permissions given through this role, use the new `inheritedClusterRoles` feature to create a custom global role. A custom global role, like the `restricted-admin` role, grants permissions on all downstream clusters. See [#42462](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42462). Given its deprecation, the `restricted-admin` role will continue to be included in future builds of Rancher through the v2.8.x and v2.9.x release lines. However, in accordance with the CVSS standard, only security issues scored as critical will be backported and fixed in the `restricted-admin` role until it is completely removed from Rancher. <!-- Security 1249 -->\r\n  - Reverse DNS server functionality has been removed. The associated [`rancher/rdns-server`](https://github.com/rancher/rdns-server) repository is now archived. Reverse DNS is already disabled by default. <!--Rancher security 1201 -->\r\n  - The Rancher CLI configuration file `~/.rancher/cli2.json` previously had permissions set to `0644`. Although `0644` would usually indicate that all users have read access to the file, the parent directory would block users' access. New Rancher CLI configuration files will only be readable by the owner (`0600`). Invoking the CLI will trigger a warning, in case old configuration files are world-readable or group-readable. See [#42838](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42838).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher App (Helm Chart) <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - When installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app in a RKE2/K3s cluster, if a private registry exists in the cluster configuration, that registry will be used for pulling images. If no cluster-scoped registry is found, the global container registry will be used. A custom default registry can be specified during the Helm chart install and upgrade workflows. Previously, only the global container registry was used when installing or upgrading an official Rancher Helm chart app for RKE2/K3s node driver clusters.<!-- no issue number --><!-- introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Continuous Delivery\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Rancher now supports **monitoring of continuous delivery**.  Starting with version `v104.0.1` of the Fleet (`v0.10.1` of Fleet) and `rancher-monitoring` chart, continuous delivery provides metrics about the state of its resources and the `rancher-monitoring` chart contains dashboards to visualize those metrics. Installing the `rancher-monitoring` chart to the local/upstream cluster automatically configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from the continuous delivery controllers and installs Grafana dashboards. These dashboards are accessible via Grafana but are not yet integrated into the Rancher UI. You can open Grafana from the Rancher UI by navigating to the *Cluster > Monitoring > Grafana* view. See [rancher/fleet#1408](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1408) for implementation details.\r\n  - Continuous delivery in Rancher also introduces  **sharding with node selectors**. See [rancher/fleet#1740](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1740) for implementation details and the [Fleet documentation](https://fleet.rancher.io/installation#multi-controller-install-sharding) for instructions on how to use it.\r\n  - We have **reduced image size and complexity** by integrating the former external gitjob repository and by merging various controller codes. This also means that the gitjob container image (`rancher/gitjob`) is not needed anymore, as the required functionality is embedded into the `rancher/fleet` container image. The gitjob deployment will still be created but pointing to the `rancher/fleet` container image instead. Please also note that a complete [list of necessary container images](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/download/v2.9.0/rancher-images.txt) for air-gapped deployments is released alongside Rancher releases. You can find this list as `rancher-images.txt` in the assets of the [release on Github](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/v2.9.0/). See [rancher/fleet#2342](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/2342) for more details.\r\n  - Continuous delivery also adds **experimental OCI content storage**. See [rancher/fleet#2561](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2561) for implementation details and [rancher/fleet-docs#179](https://github.com/rancher/fleet-docs/pull/179/files) for documentation.\r\n  - Continuous delivery now splits components into containers and has switched to the controller-runtime framework. The rewritten controllers switch to **structured logging**.\r\n  - Leader election can now be configured (see [rancher/fleet#1981](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/1981)), as well as the worker count for the fleet-controller (see [rancher/fleet#2430](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2430)).\r\n  - The release deprecates the \"fleet test\" command in favor of \"target\" and \"deploy\" with a dry-run option (see [rancher/fleet#2102](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/2102/files)).\r\n  - Bug fixes enhance drift detection, cluster status reporting, and various operational aspects.\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - You must manually change the `psp.enabled` value in the chart install yaml when you install or upgrade v102.x.y charts on hardened RKE2 clusters. [Instructions](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards#cleaning-up-releases-after-a-kubernetes-v125-upgrade) for updating the value are available. See [#41018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41018).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Rancher uses additional trusted CAs when establishing a secure connection to the keycloak OIDC authentication provider. See [#43217](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43217).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - The `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting has been replaced by the setting, `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, and is no longer available in the UI. See [#38535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/38535).\r\n  - [API tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens) now have default time periods after which they expire. Authentication tokens expire after 90 days, while kubeconfig tokens expire after 30 days. See [#41919](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41919).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher might retain resources from a disabled auth provider configuration in the local cluster, even after you configure another auth provider. To manually trigger cleanup for a disabled auth provider, add the `management.cattle.io/auth-provider-cleanup` annotation with the `unlocked` value to its auth config. See [#40378](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/40378).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - The embedded Cluster API webhook is removed from the Rancher webhook and can no longer be installed from the webhook chart. It has not been used as of Rancher v2.7.7, where it was migrated to a separate Pod. See [#44619](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/44619).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Rancher's webhook now honors the `bind` and `escalate` verbs for GlobalRoles. Users who have `*` set on GlobalRoles will now have both of these verbs, and could potentially use them to escalate privileges in Rancher v2.8.0 and later. You should review current custom GlobalRoles, especially cases where `bind`, `escalate`, or `*` are granted, before you upgrade.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - Rancher installs the same pinned version of the `rancher-webhook` chart not only in the local cluster but also in all downstream clusters. Restoring Rancher from v2.7.5 to an earlier version will result in downstream clusters' webhooks being at the version set by Rancher v2.7.5, which might cause incompatibility issues. Local and downstream webhook versions need to be in sync. See [#41730](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41730) and [#41917](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41917).\r\n  - The mutating webhook configuration for secrets is no longer active in downstream clusters. See [#41613](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41613).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Apps & Marketplace <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Legacy code for the following v1 charts is no longer available in the [`rancher/system-charts`](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts) repository:\r\n\r\n    - `rancher-cis-benchmark`\r\n    - `rancher-gatekeeper-operator`\r\n    - `rancher-istio`\r\n    - `rancher-logging`\r\n    - `rancher-monitoring`\r\n\r\n    The code for these charts will remain available for previous versions of Rancher.\r\n  - Helm v2 support is deprecated as of the Rancher v2.7 line and will be removed in Rancher v2.9.\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher no longer validates an app registration's permissions to use Microsoft Graph on endpoint updates or initial setup. You should add `Directory.Read.All` permissions of type `Application`. If you configure a different set of permissions, Rancher may not have sufficient privileges to perform some necessary actions within Azure AD, causing errors.<!-- no issue number --><!--introduced in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.0 -->\r\n  - The multi-cluster app legacy feature is no longer available. See [#39525](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39525).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - OPA Gatekeeper\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - OPA Gatekeeper is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As a replacement for OPA Gatekeeper, consider [switching to Kubewarden](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/comparisons/opa-comparison). See [#42627](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42627).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - A configurable `priorityClass` is available in the Rancher pod and its feature charts. Previously, pods critical to running Rancher didn't use a priority class. This could cause a cluster with limited resources to evict Rancher pods before other noncritical pods. See [#37927](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37927).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - If you use a version of backup-restore older than v102.0.2+up3.1.2 to take a backup of Rancher v2.7.7, the migration will encounter a `capi-webhook` error. Make sure that the chart version used for backups is v102.0.2+up3.1.2, which has `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources removed from the resourceSet. If you can't use v102.0.2+up3.1.2 for backups, delete all `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4` resources from the backup tar before using it. See [#382](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/pull/382).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - Rancher defaults to using the bci-micro image for sidecar audit logging. Previously, the default image was Busybox. See [#35587](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35587).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Rancher maintains a `/v1/counts` endpoint that the UI uses to display resource counts. The UI subscribes to changes to the counts for all resources through a websocket to receive the new counts for resources.\r\n    - Rancher aggregates the changed counts and only sends a message every 5 seconds. This, in turn, requires the UI to update the counts at most once every 5 seconds, improving UI performance. Previously, Rancher would send a message each time the resource counts changed for a resource type. This lead to the UI needing to constantly stop other areas of processing to update the resource counts. See [#36682](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36682).\r\n    - Rancher now only sends back a count for a resource type if the count has changed from the previously known number, improving UI performance. Previously, each message from this socket would include all counts for every resource type in the cluster, even if the counts only changed for one specific resource type. This would cause the UI to need to re-update resource counts for every resource type at a high frequency, with a significant performance impact. See [#36681](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36681).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - The Helm Controller in RKE2/K3s respects the `managedBy` annotation. In its initial release, Project Monitoring V2 required a workaround to set `helmProjectOperator.helmController.enabled: false`, since the Helm Controller operated on a cluster-wide level and ignored the `managedBy` annotation. See [#39724](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39724).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Security\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - When `agent-tls-mode` is set to `strict`, users must provide the certificate authority to Rancher or downstream clusters will disconnect from Rancher, and require manual intervention to fix. This applies to several setup types, including:\r\n    - Let's Encrypt - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n    - Bring Your Own Cert - When set to `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used to generate the cert and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n    - Proxy/External - when the setting is `strict`, users must upload the Certificate Authority used by the proxy and provide `privateCA=true` when installing the chart.\r\n\r\n    See [#45628](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45628) and [#45655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/45655).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are no longer supported for Rancher app ingresses. See [#42027](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42027).\r\n\r\n## Previous Rancher Behavior Changes - Extensions\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - A new [feature flag `uiextensions`](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.9/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions#enabling-extension-support-in-rancher) has been added for enabling and disabling the UI extension feature (this replaces the need to install the `ui-plugin-operator`). The first time it's set to `true` (the default value is `true`) it will create the CRD and enable the controllers and endpoints necessary for the feature to work. If set to `false`, it won't create the CRD if it doesn't already exist, but it won't delete it if it does. It will also disable the controllers and endpoints used by the feature. Enabling or disabling the feature flag will cause Rancher to restart. See [#44230](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/44230) and [#43089](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43089).\r\n  - UI extension owners must update and publish a new version of their extensions to be compatible with Rancher v2.9.0 and later. For more information see the [Rancher v2.9 extension support page](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/rancher-2.9-support).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - The Rancher dashboard fails to load an extension that utilizes backported Vue 3 features, displaying an error in the console `object(...) is not a function`. New extensions that utilize the `defineComponent` will not be backwards compatible with older versions of the dashboard. Existing extensions should continue to work moving forward. See [#10568](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10568).  \r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n  - When you upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you might see the following error: `Cluster health check failed`. This is a benign error that occurs as part of the upgrade process, and will self-resolve. It's caused by the Kubernetes API server becoming temporarily unavailable as it is being upgraded within your cluster. See [#41012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41012).\r\n  - Once you configure a setting with an environmental variable, it can't be updated through the Rancher API or the UI. It can only be updated through changing the value of the environmental variable. Setting the environmental variable to \"\" (the empty string) changes the value in the Rancher API but not in Kubernetes. As a workaround, run `kubectl edit setting <setting-name>`, then set the value and source fields to `\"\"`, and re-deploy Rancher. See [#37998](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37998).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher UI to add a new port of type `ClusterIP` to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port won't be created upon your first attempt to save the new port. You must repeat the procedure to add the port again. The Service Type field will display `Do not create a service` during the second procedure. Change this to `ClusterIP` and save to create the new port. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE Provisioning\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Weave CNI plugin for RKE v1.27 and later is now deprecated, due to the plugin being deprecated for upstream Kubernetes v1.27 and later. RKE creation will not go through as it will raise a validation warning. See [#11322](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11322).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - Currently there are known issues with the [data directory feature](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/45038) which are outlined below:\r\n    - K3s does not support the data directory feature. See [#10589](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/10589).\r\n    - Currently selecting `Use the same path for System-agent, Provisioning and K8s Distro data directories configuration` results in Rancher using the same data directory for system agent, provisioning, and distribution components as opposed to appending the specified component names to the root directory. To mitigate this issue, you will need to configure the 3 paths separately and they must follow the guidelines below:\r\n          - Absolute paths (start with /)\r\n          - Clean (not contain env vars, shell expressions, ., or ..)\r\n          - Not set to the same thing\r\n          - Not nested one within another\r\n      See [#11566](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11566).\r\n  - When adding the `provisioning.cattle.io/allow-dynamic-schema-drop` annotation through the cluster config UI, the annotation disappears before adding the value field. When viewing the YAML, the respective value field is not updated and is displayed as an empty string. As a workaround, when creating the cluster, set the annotation by using the **Edit Yaml** option located in the dropdown **\u22ee** attached to your respective cluster in the **Cluster Management** view. See [#11435](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11435).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.4:**\r\n  - RKE2 clusters with invalid values for tolerations or affinity agent customizations don't display an error message, and remain in an `Updating` state. This causes cluster creation to hang. See [#41606](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41606).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When viewing or editing the YAML configuration of downstream RKE2 clusters through the UI, `spec.rkeConfig.machineGlobalConfig.profile` is set to `null`, which is an invalid configuration. See [#8480](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8480).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [RKE2 uninstall script](https://docs.rke2.io/install/uninstall?_highlight=uninstall#tarball-method).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.9:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Communication between the ingress controller and the pods doesn't work when you create an RKE2 cluster with Cilium as the CNI and activate project network isolation. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/faq/container-network-interface-providers#ingress-routing-across-nodes-in-cilium) and [#34275](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34275).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - When provisioning clusters with an RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners doesn't take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. As a workaround, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#40128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128).<!-- first appears in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.3 as https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689 which redirects to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40128 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Amazon ECR Private Registries don't work from RKE2/K3s. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n  - Deleting nodes from custom RKE2/K3s clusters in Rancher v2.7.2 can cause unexpected behavior, if the underlying infrastructure isn't thoroughly cleaned. When deleting a custom node from your cluster, ensure that you delete the underlying infrastructure for it, or run the corresponding uninstall script for the Kubernetes distribution installed on the node. See [#41034](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41034):\r\n    - [K3s uninstall script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/uninstall).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Deleting a control plane node results in worker nodes also reconciling. See [#39021](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39021)..<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.3, but issue mentions 2.6.9, and isn't listed at all in v2.6.x notes yet -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2**:\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n  - Node drivers that rely on machine configs that contain fields of the type `array string` render a form requesting a single string instead. See [#11936](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11936).\r\n  - Some node drivers incorrectly stipulate that no credentials are required, resulting in the UI skipping the requirement to supply credentials when provisioning a cluster of that type. See [#11974](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11974).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7**:\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2**:\r\n  - When creating a GKE cluster in the Rancher UI you will see provisioning failures as the `clusterIpv4CidrBlock` and `clusterSecondaryRangeName` fields conflict. See [#8749](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8749).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher CLI\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - The Rancher CLI currently lists the Azure authentication provider options out of order. See [#46128](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46128).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Docker Install <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Single node Rancher won't start on Apple M1 devices with Docker Desktop 4.3.0 or later. See [#35930](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35930).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798) and [#40257](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40257).\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.0:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to longer startup times. When launching Docker for the first time, you'll receive an error message stating, \"Cannot read property `endsWith` of undefined\", as described in [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).  You'll then be directed to a login screen. See [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Windows <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n\r\n### Long-standing Known Issues - Windows Nodes in RKE2 Clusters\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - NodePorts do not work on Windows Server 2022 in RKE2 clusters due to a Windows kernel bug. See [#159](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/159).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - AKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Imported Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters don't display workload level metrics. This bug affects Monitoring V1. A [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658#issuecomment-733035658) is available. See [#4658](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4658).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.x:**\r\n  - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).<!-- no mention of patch version in issue thread, milestone is simply v2.6, already appear as a longstanding issue in https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.0 -->\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - When editing or upgrading an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).<!-- first proposed as a release note for https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561#issuecomment-879272354 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - GKE\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to Kubernetes v1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.1**\r\n  - Temporarily reducing privileges by impersonating an account with lower privileges is currently not supported. See [#41988](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/41988) and [#46790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46790).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Pod Security Standard (PSS) & Pod Security Admission (PSA) <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - The deployment's `securityContext` section is missing when a new workload is created. This prevents pods from starting when Pod Security Policy (PSP) support is enabled. See [#4815](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815).<!-- https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4815#issuecomment-1074184973 -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - The SAML authentication pop-up throws a `404` error on high-availability RKE installations. Single node Docker installations aren't affected. If you refresh the browser window and select **Resend**, the authentication request will succeed, and you will be able to log in. See [#31163](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31163).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.2:**\r\n  - Users on certain LDAP setups don't have permission to search LDAP. When they attempt to perform a search, they receive the error message, `Result Code 32 \"No Such Object\"`. See [#35259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35259).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Encryption\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.4:**\r\n  - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Harvester\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - In the Rancher UI when navigating between Harvester clusters of different versions a refresh may be required to view version specific functionality. See [#11559](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11559).\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.4:**\r\n  - When provisioning a Harvester RKE1 cluster in Rancher, the **vGPU** field is not displayed under **Cluster Management > Advanced Settings**, this is not a supported feature. However, the **vGPU** field is available when provisioning a Harvester RKE2 cluster. See [#10909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10909).\r\n  - When provisioning a multi-node Harvester RKE2 cluster in Rancher, you need to allocate one vGPU more than the number of nodes you have or provisioning will fail. See [#11009](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11009) and v2.9.0 back-port issue [#10989](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/10989).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Continuous Delivery <!-- fleet --> <!-- use function based naming from https://jira.suse.com/browse/SURE-6864? e.g. \"Continuous Deployment with Fleet?\" -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Target customization can produce custom resources that exceed the Rancher API's maximum bundle size. This results in `Request entity too large` errors when attempting to add a GitHub repo. Only target customizations that modify the Helm chart URL or version are affected. As a workaround, use multiple paths or GitHub repos instead of target customization. See [#1650](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/1650).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the **Continuous Delivery** page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.0:**\r\n  - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment, rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).<!-- first added in https://github.com/rancherlabs/release-notes/pull/139-->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Feature Charts\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.5:**\r\n  - After installing an app from a partner chart repo, the partner chart will upgrade to feature charts if the chart also exists in the feature charts default repo. See [#5655](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/5655).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - CIS Scan <!-- neo/security -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.3:**\r\n  - Some CIS checks related to file permissions fail on RKE and RKE2 clusters with CIS v1.7 and CIS v1.8 profiles. See [#42971](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42971).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - When running CIS scans on RKE and RKE2 clusters on Kubernetes v1.25, some tests will fail if the `rke-profile-hardened-1.23` or the `rke2-profile-hardened-1.23` profile is used. These [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1368903719) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851#issuecomment-1430941043) test cases failing is expected as they rely on PSPs, which have been removed in Kubernetes v1.25. See [#39851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39851).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve `Active` status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.3:**\r\n  - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22+ cluster will fail. The backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion `v1beta1`. There are two workarounds for this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/migrate-rancher-to-new-cluster#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Istio <!-- mapps -->\r\n\r\n- Istio v1.12 and below do not work on Kubernetes v1.23 clusters. To use the Istio charts, please do not update to Kubernetes v1.23 until the next charts' release.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.4:**\r\n  - Applications injecting Istio sidecars, fail on SELinux RHEL 8.4 enabled clusters. A temporary workaround for this issue is to run the following command on each cluster node before creating a cluster: `mkdir -p /var/run/istio-cni && semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t /var/run/istio-cni && restorecon -v /var/run/istio-cni`. See [#33291](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33291).\r\n- **Rancher v2.6.1:**\r\n  - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Logging <!-- opni -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing a helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.0:**\r\n  - Read-only project permissions and the View Monitoring role aren't sufficient to view links on the Monitoring index page. Users won't be able to see monitoring links. As a workaround, you can perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n    1. If you haven't already, install Monitoring on the project.\r\n    1. Move the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace into the project.\r\n    1. Grant project users the View Monitoring (`monitoring-ui-view`) role, and `read-only` or higher permissions on at least one project in the cluster.\r\n\r\n    See [#4466](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4466).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Project Monitoring <!-- opni-->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.5.8:**\r\n  - If you deploy Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with `win_prefix_path` set, you must deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts. This will allow Rancher to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).", "created_at": "2024-10-24T18:36:54Z", "project": "Rancher", "repo": "rancher/rancher", "type": "Pass", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.31.2+k3s1", "tag_name": "v1.31.2+k3s1", "html_url": "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.31.2%2Bk3s1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rancher/k3s", "body": "<!-- v1.31.2+k3s1 -->\r\n\r\nThis release updates Kubernetes to v1.31.2, and fixes a number of issues.\r\n\r\nFor more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md#changelog-since-v1311).\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.31.1+k3s1:\r\n\r\n* Add int test for flannel-ipv6masq [(#10904)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/10904)\r\n* Bump Wharfie to v0.6.7 [(#10974)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/10974)\r\n* Add user path to runtimes search [(#11002)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11002)\r\n* Add e2e test for advanced fields in services [(#11023)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11023)\r\n* Launch private registry with init [(#11048)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11048)\r\n* Backports for 2024-10 [(#11054)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11054)\r\n* Allow additional Rootless CopyUpDirs through K3S_ROOTLESS_COPYUPDIRS [(#11041)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11041)\r\n* Bump containerd to v1.7.22 [(#11072)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11072)\r\n* Simplify svclb ds [(#11079)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11079)\r\n* Add the nvidia runtime cdi [(#11093)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11093)\r\n* Revert \"Make svclb as simple as possible\" [(#11118)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11118)\r\n* Fixes \"file exists\" error from CNI bins when upgrading k3s [(#11125)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11125)\r\n* Update Kubernetes to v1.31.2 [(#11155)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/11155)\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.31.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md#v1312) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.13.2](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.13.2) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.46.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_1.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.5.13-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.13-k3s1) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.7.22-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.22-k3s1) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.1.14](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.14) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.25.6](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.25.6) | \r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.7.2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.7.2) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.11.10](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.10) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.11.3](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.11.3) | \r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.16.5](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.16.5) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.30](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.30) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

[!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before installing Longhorn v1.7.2.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.2/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.21 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.6.x or v1.7.x (< v1.7.0) to v1.7.2.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.2/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation & Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the [environment check script](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/v1.7.x/scripts/environment_check.sh) overlaps with that of the Longhorn CLI, which is available starting with v1.7.0. Because of this, the script is deprecated in v1.7.0 and is scheduled for removal in v1.8.0.\r\n\r\nFor information about important changes, including feature incompatibility, deprecation, and removal, see [Important Notes](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.7.2/important-notes/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Post-Release Known Issues\r\n\r\nFor information about issues identified after this release, see [Release-Known-Issues](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Release-Known-Issues).\r\n\r\n## Resolved Issues\r\n\r\n### Improvement\r\n\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][IMPROVEMENT] Allow specify data engine version for the default storageclass during Helm installation [9632](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9632) - @shuo-wu @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][IMPROVEMENT] Remove mirrored openshift image from Longhorn [9598](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9598) - @derekbit @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][IMPROVEMENT] Fix contradicting node status events [9326](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9326) - @yangchiu @PhanLe1010\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][IMPROVEMENT] Check kernel module `dm_crypt` on host machines [9317](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9317) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n\r\n### Bug\r\n\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] longhornctl install preflight --operating-system=cos failed on COS_CONTAINERD [9666](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9666) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] System Restore Stuck at Pending due to Tolerations not Applied [9655](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9655) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG][v1.7.x] Disks modal broken layout [9633](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9633) - @a110605 @roger-ryao\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Single Replica Node Down test cases fail [9628](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9628) - @yangchiu @c3y1huang\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Test case `Stopped replicas on deleted nodes should not be counted as healthy replicas when draining nodes` fails [9621](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9621) - @yangchiu @derekbit\r\n- [BUG] robot test case `Single Replica Node Down Deletion Policy do-nothing With RWO Volume Replica Locate On Replica Node` fails to wait for the volume getting stuck in attaching state [9498](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9498) - @c3y1huang\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] All Backups are lost in the Backup Target if the NFS Service Disconnects and Reconnects again [9542](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9542) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] PV Annotation Isn't Updated After Creating An Oversize Volume [9515](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9515) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Instance manager missing required selector labels after manager crash [9471](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9471) - @c3y1huang @chriscchien\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Engine Upgrade to 1.7.1 fails on volumes with strict-local data locality [9416](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9416) - @yangchiu @james-munson\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Longhorn did not close and open encrypted volumes correctly when the service k3s-agent restarted for a while [9387](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9387) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Longhorn keeps resetting my storageClass [9396](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9396) - @yangchiu @mantissahz\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.7.2][BUG] Fix test case test_rwx_delete_share_manager_pod failure after changes to RWX workload restart.

This method provides data restoration in case of missing parts while optimizing storage space:\r\n\r\n - `EC8+1`: Uses 112.5% of space,\r\n - `EC4+1`: Uses 125% of space,\r\n\r\nwhile maintaining the same level of hardware failure protection as standard replication (200%).\r\n\r\n### New Options in Storage Class Definitions\r\n\r\n- **`TRASH` State**: files in the MooseFS TRASH, so the deleted files that are retained for a configurable period of time, can now have custom storage definitions within a storage class.\r\n- **`ARCHIVE` State Configuration**: `ARCHIVE` state is now fully configurable:\r\n - Set file archive times based on last `atime`, `mtime`, or `ctime`.\r\n - Choose between `FAST` archival (ASAP) or `PER CHUNK`  based on `mtime`.\r\n - Exclude files below a certain length from being archived.\r\n - **Logical Expressions in Label Definitions**: Support for comprehensive logical expressions in label definitions is now available, allowing users to create more flexible and precise rules, providing greater control over how storage classes and states are applied to files. This includes the ability to use negations.\r\n - State-Specific Label Overrides: Override label modes (`STD`, `LOOSE`, `STRICT`) for specific states: `CREATE`, `KEEP`, `ARCHIVE`, or `TRASH`.\r\n\r\n### Storage Class Based on File Patterns\r\nUsers can now assign file storage classes dynamically based on custom file name patterns, providing greater flexibility in managing data. For example, files with a `.backup` extension could be assigned to a specific storage class with lower redundancy, while files starting with `important_` might be placed in a high-redundancy class.\r\n\r\n### Broadcast Mechanism for Server Restarts\r\nServer restarts (both chunk server and master) no longer block I/O until the end of chunk registration process.\r\n\r\n### Improved Chunk Format\r\nEnhanced handling of control sums for more secure chunk storage.\r\n\r\n### New Web-based Graphical User Interface with Dark Mode\r\nAdditional monitoring charts and system insights, offering improved chart systems and more detailed information. Moreover, dark mode is now available.\r\n\r\n### Multi-LAN Configuration\r\nSupport for clients across different LANs to remain within their LAN IP class while communicating with the master server. Can be used alongside the `remap` option known from MooseFS 3.x.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced IP Remap\r\nCustomizable IP-to-IP remapping instead of just fixed remapping of leading bits in IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Daemon Info\r\nMooseFS daemons instructed by an `info` signal can now generate detailed info files in working directory, listing configuration, state, and module data for enhanced troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### CS-Master Consistency Checks\r\nNew mechanism to ensure consistency between master and chunk server data held in RAM.\r\n\r\n### New `mfshdd.cfg` Options\r\nFlags with limits and options for disks with chunks shared with other processes, allowing better calculation of available/occupied space on disks.\r\n\r\n### New Offline Tool: `mfsmetasearch`\r\nAllows offline searches for files in metadata based on various conditions such as chunk IDs, inodes, and attributes.\r\n\r\n### Updated Logging System\r\nClear division of log messages by severity levels, with customizable logging options and syslog reporting.\r\n\r\n### New ACL Handling Tools\r\nUseful for operating systems without built-in ACL management tools.\r\n\r\n### General Algorithm Improvements\r\nNumerous improvements to algorithms for faster and more efficient MooseFS performance, especially in edge-case scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Quality of Life Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Faster Metadata Loading** at master server startup.\r\n- **`mfssupervisor` Tool** for on-demand metadata saves.\r\n- **`mfsfileinfo` Tool** can now display chunk paths on chunk servers.\r\n- **Enhanced Chunk Rebalance Algorithms**.\r\n- **More Configuration Options** for various operations and storage management.\r\n\r\n## Community Contributions\r\nDuring the development of this version, we received valuable feedback and suggestions from our community, many of which have been implemented. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to shaping this release of MooseFS!\r\n\r\n\r\n## MooseFS PRO\r\nIf you are looking for high availability (HA) for master servers, improved disk space management with enhanced data protection through EC configurations with higher redundancy levels, and dedicated support, we also offer MooseFS PRO version. This version is designed for enterprise environments where uptime and data integrity are critical, providing features like automatic failover for master servers, more advanced erasure coding for greater resilience against hardware failures, and professional support services to ensure smooth operation and rapid issue resolution. MooseFS PRO adds an extra layer of reliability and optimization for those managing large-scale, mission-critical storage systems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe recommend to update your MooseFS clusters to this version.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPiotr / MooseFS Team", "created_at": "2024-09-23T10:07:48Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.7.0", "tag_name": "v2.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.7.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh", "body": "# v2.7.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a regular minor version upgrade, mainly for feature enhancements and bug fixes.

With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.\r\nA successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.\r\nPlease ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.\r\n\r\n### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names\r\n\r\nStarting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:\r\n\r\n- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"utf8-strict-mode\"`.\r\n\r\n- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.\r\n\r\nShould you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"classic-mode\"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-02-28T11:46:46Z", "project": "Alertmanager", "repo": "prometheus/alertmanager", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v10.5", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/gluster/glusterfs/commits/723d46f02cc87959a61afff11f3631e011a3cd56", "repo_url": "https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs", "body": "Add GlusterFS 10.5 release notes (#4262)\n\nUpdates: #4253\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Shwetha K Acharya <sacharya@redhat.com>", "created_at": "2023-11-14T14:36:43Z", "project": "Glusterfs", "repo": "gluster/glusterfs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.8.3", "tag_name": "v2.8.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/distribution/distribution/releases/tag/v2.8.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/docker/distribution", "body": "## What's Changed\r\n* Pass `BUILDTAGS` argument to `go build` by @marcusirgens in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/3926\r\n* Enable Go build tags by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4009\r\n* `reference`: replace deprecated function `SplitHostname` by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4032\r\n* Dont parse errors as JSON unless Content-Type is set to JSON by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4054\r\n* update to go 1.20.8 by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4056\r\n* Set `Content-Type` header in registry client `ReadFrom` by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4053\r\n* deprecate reference package, migrate to github.com/distribution/reference by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4063\r\n* `digestset`: deprecate package in favor of `go-digest/digestset`  by @thaJeztah in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4064\r\n* Do not close HTTP request body in HTTP handler by @milosgajdos in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4068\r\n* Add v2.8.3 release notes by @milosgajdos in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/4088\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @marcusirgens made their first contribution in https://github.com/distribution/distribution/pull/3926\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/distribution/distribution/compare/v2.8.2...v2.8.3", "created_at": "2023-10-02T17:48:45Z", "project": "Distribution", "repo": "docker/distribution", "type": "Registry", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.0.33", "tag_name": "v1.0.33", "html_url": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/releases/tag/v1.0.33", "repo_url": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification", "body": "Specification release v1.0.33", "created_at": "2023-08-17T21:13:27Z", "project": "TUF", "repo": "theupdateframework/specification", "type": "Software Update", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.11.4", "tag_name": "v0.11.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.11.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint", "body": "## 0.11.4 (August 9, 2023)\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* plugin/aws/ecr-pull: Support entrypoint injection in ecr-pull builder [[GH-4847](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/4847)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* cli: Fix possible issues with deleted applications or projects failing to render in output [[GH-4867](https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint/issues/4867)]\n* runneruninstall/aws-ecs: Fix installing runners in new AWS accounts by fixing an inline policy syntax error.
