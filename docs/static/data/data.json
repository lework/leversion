The filename must be PR#-githubID-category, where githubID is that of the person opening the PR, and the category matches the label category.\r\n\r\n## Gateway API\r\n\r\n### Support TLSRoute weighted ForwardTos (#3938)\r\n\r\nAdd support for weighted ForwardTos in TLSRoute rules.\r\nPer spec, weights default to 1 if unspecified, and weights of 0 mean no traffic is forwarded to the backend.\r\n\r\n## Site\r\n\r\n### Alt attribute to images (#3917)\r\n\r\nAdds `alt` tags for better web accessibility.\r\n\r\nThanks @johnnycase for contributing this!\r\n\r\n### Website notice feature (#3955)\r\n\r\nAdds site formatting for projectcontour.io to have new \"warning\", \"note\", \"info\", and \"tip\" notices.\r\n\r\nThanks @gary-tai for contributing this!\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### Update security process docs post advisory (#3945)\r\n\r\nUpdates the security process should a new security advisory be discovered with Contour.\r\n\r\n### Add threat model and security posture documentation (#4011)\r\n\r\nAdds a Security document outlining Contour's threat model and how to report security issues.\r\n\r\n### Updates for Kubernetes 1.22 (#3953)\r\n\r\nUpdates Go modules, KinD images, and kubectl version to support Kubernetes 1.22.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct (#4032)\r\n\r\nUpdates the Code of Conduct to use the CNCF template.\r\n\r\nThanks @mzrithm for contributing this!\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\n\r\nPlease consult the [upgrade documentation](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).\r\n\r\n## Compatible Kubernetes Versions\r\n\r\nContour v1.19.0 is tested against Kubernetes 1.20 through 1.22\r\n\r\n# Community Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re immensely grateful for all the community contributions that help make Contour even better!

Release notes for kOps 1.21 series\r\n\r\n# Significant changes\r\n\r\n## Service Account Issuer Discovery and AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)\r\n\r\nkOps now supports publishing an OIDC-compatible discovery document to an S3 bucket and configuring AWS to use it for IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).\r\n\r\nSee the [Service Account Issuer Discovery](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cluster_spec#service-account-issuer-discovery-and-aws-iam-roles-for-service-accounts-irsa) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n## Dedicated API Server nodes.\r\n\r\nkOps now supports extending the control plane with [dedicated apiserver nodes](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/scaling). These nodes run in dedicated instance groups that can be scaled horizontally.\r\n\r\nIn 1.21, this feature is behind a feature flag as node role name, labels, taints, and domains can change based on feedback from the community.\r\n\r\n## Warm Pool (AWS only)\r\n\r\nA Warm Pool contains pre-initialized EC2 instances that can join the cluster significantly faster than regular instances. These instances run the kOps configuration process, pull known container images, and then shut down. When the ASG needs to scale out it will pull instances from the warm pool if any are available.\r\n\r\nSee the [warm pool](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#warmpool-aws-only) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n# Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* Protokube now runs as a systemd process rather than a docker container.\r\n\r\n* Support for AWS launch configurations has been removed in favour of launch templates.\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use Node Termination Handler's Queue Processor mode, which offers more functionality than the IMDS Processor mode. See [the addons page](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#queue-processor-mode) for more information.\r\n\r\n* New addon for the [CSI snapshot-controller](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#snapshot-controller).\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.13 and 1.14 has been removed.\r\n\r\n# Required Actions\r\n\r\n* The ClusterRoleBinding for AWS EBS CSI DaemonSet has changed name. If you installed this addon before kOps 1.21, you need run `kubectl delete crb ebs-csi-node-binding`.\r\n\r\n* To support [Node Termination Handler's Queue Process mode](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#node-termination-handler), AWS cluster deletion now requires the kops CLI have `sqs:ListQueues` and `events:ListRules` permissions regardless of whether or not the addon is used.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.22.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used as of kOps 1.22. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n# Full change list since 1.21.1 release\r\n\r\n* Update Calico to v3.19.3 for kOps 1.21 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12362](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12362)\r\n* Truncate cluster name in NTH EventBridgeRules [@rifelpet](https://github.com/rifelpet) [#12439](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12439)\r\n* Don't ignore channel value in toolbox template [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12464](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12464)\r\n* Update containerd and Docker for kOps 1.21 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12508](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12508)", "created_at": "2021-10-09T06:18:36Z", "project": "kops", "repo": "kubernetes/kops", "type": "Installer", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release v2.6.1", "tag_name": "v2.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.6.1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rancher/rancher", "body": "> It is important to review the Install/Upgrade Notes below before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Tech Preview - Harvester Integration with Rancher\r\n\r\nRancher 2.6.1 introduces [Harvester v0.3.0](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v0.3/) as a new integration. This integration only works with Harvester version 0.3.0 or higher. A feature flag, enabled by default, provides access to the integration. When enabled, users can manage Harvester clusters within Rancher. See [#33605](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33605). \r\n\r\n- Import multiple Harvester clusters for multi-cluster/multi-site management.\r\n- Use Rancher RBAC and enterprise authentication to log into Harvester clusters.\r\n- Use Rancher Projects in Harvester so teams can keep their VMs separate and organized.\r\n- Provision Kubernetes clusters on Harvester. You can use Harvester's built-in CSI driver and load balancer for your Kubernetes workloads (cloud provider). To set up the cloud provider with Harvester, refer [here](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v0.3-dev/rancher/cloud-provider/#load-balancer-request-parameters). See [#4208](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4208).\r\n\r\n### Security Enhancements\r\n\r\n- RKE and RKE2 include new versions of Kubernetes that address an issue where symlink exchanges could allow host filesystem access. See [CVE-2021-25741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25741).\r\n- Role revisions are properly tracked for ClusterRoles associated to RoleBinding resources. This allows returning up-to-date schemas for users and not evaluating a user's access from stale access states. See [#34732](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34732).\r\n\r\n### Fleet\r\n\r\n- Fleet can now manage clusters running other instances of Fleet. This enables Rancher to manage Harvester clusters, other Rancher instances, or stand alone Fleet. Becasue of this change, it is possible two Fleet agents are in a cluster. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- AKS clusters now display applicable upgrade versions only. See [#34161](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34161).\r\n- The AKS provisioner now correctly handles simultaneous Kubernetes version upgrades and node pool additions. See [#33426](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33426).\r\n- Fixed conflict errors for the impersonation cluster role causing requests to occasionally fail with an `unable to create impersonator account: error setting up impersonation for user u-xxxxx` error. See [#34671](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34671)\r\n- The Istio chart now allows upgrades of Istio in an air gapped environment. Upgrading will be limited to versions available at time of build. See [#30842](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30842).\r\n- The side navigation no longer shows an incorrect top-level \"Istio\" menu item after upgrading from Rancher v2.5.x with v1 Istio enabled. See [#4072](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4072).\r\n- Resource deletion has been updated to address multiple cases. See [#34761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34761).\r\n  - Nodes are correctly removed from the infrastructure provider when the cluster is deleted in Rancher. See [#34542](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34542).\r\n  - Nodes from a misconfigured node pool no longer remain in the cluster after being deleted. See [#34713](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34713).\r\n  - The deleted status of clusters are now synchronized across pages in Rancher. See [#33774](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33774).\r\n- Fixed an issue where Fleet would infinitely create cluster management secrets when no system namespace exists. See [#34776](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34776).\r\n- Migrating clusters to a different `FleetWorkspace` no longer results in the management cluster being deleted. See [#34744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34744).\r\n- The external IP address is now properly retrieved for Windows nodes in a custom RKE2 cluster. See Windows [#91](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/91).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n- The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to cattle-fleet-local-system. This change does not impact GitOps workflows. \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:** \r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n  - When using Kubernetes v1.21 with Windows Server 20H2 Standard Core, the patch \"2019-08 Servicing Stack Update for Windows Server\" must be installed on the node. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For K8s 1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n- **The Fleet agent in the local cluster now lives in `cattle-fleet-local-system`.** Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **New steps for rolling back Rancher.** The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters.** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **New procedure to set up Azure cloud provider for RKE2.** For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs Kube Nodes.** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs.**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Legacy Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.1\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.13](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.13)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.1](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.1)\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0 many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nPlease review the new Harvester feature flag introduced into 2.6.1 and its default status. Additional feature flags introduced in 2.6.0 are shown also for reference.\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tWe have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-maintenance-terms/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes 1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Tech Preview**: There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.\r\n    - There are issues around removing etcd nodes from a cluster. See [#34488](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34488).\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - Proxy behind individual downstream clusters is not working. See [#32633](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32633).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace. See [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support upgrading RKE2 versions. See Windows [#76](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/76).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561)\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n  - **GKE**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n- **Harvester - Tech Preview:**\r\n  - Harvester v0.3.0 doesn't support air gap environment installation. See [#34908](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34908).\r\n  - Harvester v0.3.0 doesn't support upgrade from v0.2.0 nor upgrade to future v1.0.0.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the resourceSet rancher-resource-set will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.10.4 will be available with the Rancher Istio Helm chart v100.0.0+up1.10.4. A previous version of Istio, 1.10.2, included a security fix for CVE-2021-34824. See [#32795](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32795).\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. Everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.21. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n- **Docker installs:** There are UI issues around startup time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800) and [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n- **Login to Rancher using ActiveDirectory with TLS:** See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).\r\n  - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an ActiveDirectory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Golang 1.15.\r\n  - The error received is \"Error creating ssl connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\"\r\n  - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting \"GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\" as an environment variable to Rancher server container.\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt. See [#4280](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4280).\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a port to a Deployment that was created initially without any ports using the legacy UI, users may encounter a `services <NAME> already exists` error. To work around this issue, the legacy UI should be used to make updates to the configuration of Deployments created using the legacy UI. See [#4159](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4159).\r\n  - When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.

This was slow for\nseveral reasons:\n\n* Type inference is generally slow for large collections (hash/array)\n* Iterable functions like `reduce` pass an accumulator to the block for each\n  iteration, so we inferred the accumulator's type multiple times.\n* When building a collection using `reduce`, the accumulator increases in size\n  each time. So constructions like the following infer the type of an\n  accumulator of size 0, 1, ..., N-1, which is equivalent to inferring the type\n  of an accumulator of size N(N-1)/2:\n\n      Integer[1, N].reduce([]) |$memo, $value| { $memo << $value}\n\nHowever, block arguments are often defined without a type, e.g. `$memo`, so the\ntype inference was wasted effort.\n\nThis commit switches from `callable?` to `callable_with?`. So rather than\ninferring the type of all arguments, and checking if those types are assignable\nto the parameter's type, we instead check if each argument is an instance of the\nparameter's type. For example, we check if the Ruby Hash {} is an instance of\nthe `PAnyType`, which is always true[1]. The `callable_with?` method also checks\nrequired and optional parameters and return types, like the `callable?` method\ndoes.\n\nNote the `callable_with?` method was introduced in 2edd30e0 to address similar\ntype inference slowness.\n\n[1] https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/7.11.0/lib/puppet/pops/types/types.rb#L268", "created_at": "2021-10-08T17:56:39Z", "project": "Puppet", "repo": "puppetlabs/puppet", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.5-dev9", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/haproxy/haproxy/commits/4c67bd6a06a43600aed2ab0f7b59328dac256907", "repo_url": "https://github.com/haProxy/haProxy", "body": "[RELEASE] Released version 2.5-dev9\n\nReleased version 2.5-dev9 with the following main changes :\n    -

See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent). This option simplifies the migration path from DataDog to VictoriaMetrics. See also [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/206).\r\n* FEATURE: vmagent [enterprise](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html): add support for data reading and writing from/to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#kafka-integration).\r\n* FEATURE: vmui: switch to [\u03bcPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) and add ability to naturally scroll and zoom graphs. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui). Thanks to @Loori-R.\r\n* FEATURE: vmstorage: stop accepting new data if `-storageDataPath` directory contains less than `-storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes` of free space. This should prevent from `out of disk space` crashes. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/269).\r\n* FEATURE: calculate quantiles in the same way as Prometheus does in such functions as [quantile_over_time](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#quantile_over_time) and [quantile](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#quantile). Previously results from VictoriaMetrics could be slightly different than results from Prometheus. See [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1625) and [this](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1612) issues.\r\n* FEATURE: add `rollup_scrape_interval(m[d])` function to [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html), which returns `min`, `max` and `avg` values for the interval between samples for `m` on the given lookbehind window `d`.\r\n* FEATURE: add `topk_last(k, q)` and `bottomk_last(k, q)` functions to [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html), which return up to `k` time series from `q` with the maximum / minimum last value on the graph.\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: align behavior of the queries `a or on (labels) b`, `a and on (labels) b` and `a unless on (labels) b` where `b` has multiple time series with the given `labels` to Prometheus behavior.

Init containers are containers which run before the rest of the pod starts. There are two types of init containers: \"always\", which always run before the pod is started, and \"once\", which only run the first time the pod starts and are subsequently removed. They can be added using the `podman create` command's `--init-ctr` option.\r\n- Support for init containers has also been added to `podman play kube` and `podman generate kube` - init containers contained in Kubernetes YAML will be created as Podman init containers, and YAML generated by Podman will include any init containers created.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports building images. If the `--build` option is given and a directory with the name of the specified image exists in the current working directory and contains a valid Containerfile or Dockerfile, the image will be built and used for the container.\r\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports a new option, `--down`, which removes any pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML.\r\n- The `podman generate kube` command now generates annotations for SELinux mount options on volume (`:z` and `:Z`) that are respected by the `podman play kube` command.\r\n- A new command has been added, `podman pod logs`, to return logs for all containers in a pod at the same time.\r\n- Two new commands have been added, `podman volume export` (to export a volume to a tar file) and `podman volume import`) (to populate a volume from a given tar file).\r\n- The `podman auto-update` command now supports simple rollbacks. If a container fails to start after an automatic update, it will be rolled back to the previous image and restarted again.\r\n- Pods now share their user namespace by default, and the `podman pod create` command now supports the `--userns` option. This allows rootless pods to be created with the `--userns=keep-id` option.\r\n- The `podman pod ps` command now supports a new filter with its `--filter` option, `until`, which returns pods created before a given timestamp.\r\n- The `podman image scp` command has been added. This command allows images to be transferred between different hosts.\r\n- The `podman stats` command supports a new option, `--interval`, to specify the amount of time before the information is refreshed.\r\n- The `podman inspect` command now includes ports exposed (but not published) by containers (e.g. ports from `--expose` when `--publish-all` is not specified).\r\n- The `podman inspect` command now has a new boolean value, `Checkpointed`, which indicates that a container was stopped as a result of a `podman container checkpoint` operation.\r\n- Volumes created by `podman volume create` now support setting quotas when run atop XFS. The `size` and `inode` options allow the maximum size and maximum number of inodes consumed by a volume to be limited.\r\n- The `podman info` command now outputs information on what log drivers, network drivers, and volume plugins are available for use ([#11265](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11265)).\r\n- The `podman info` command now outputs the current log driver in use, and the variant and codename of the distribution in use.\r\n- The parameters of the VM created by `podman machine init` (amount of disk space, memory, CPUs) can now be set in `containers.conf`.\r\n- The `podman machine ls` command now shows additional information (CPUs, memory, disk size) about VMs managed by `podman machine`.\r\n- The `podman ps` command now includes healthcheck status in container state for containers that have healthchecks ([#11527](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11527)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The `podman build` command has a new alias, `podman buildx`, to improve compatibility with Docker. We have already added support for many `docker buildx` flags to `podman build` and aim to continue to do so.\r\n- Cases where Podman is run without a user session or a writable temporary files directory will now produce better error messages.\r\n- The default log driver has been changed from `file` to `journald`. The `file` driver did not properly support log rotation, so this should lead to a better experience. If journald is not available on the system, Podman will automatically revert to the `file`.\r\n- Podman no longer depends on `ip` for removing networks ([#11403](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11403)).\r\n- The deprecated `--macvlan` flag to `podman network create` now warns when it is used. It will be removed entirely in the Podman 4.0 release.\r\n- The `podman machine start` command now prints a message when the VM is successfully started.\r\n- The `podman stats` command can now be used on containers that are paused.\r\n- The `podman unshare` command will now return the exit code of the command that was run in the user namespace (assuming the command was successfully run).\r\n- Successful healthchecks will no longer add a `healthy` line to the system log to reduce log spam.\r\n- As a temporary workaround for a lack of shortname prompts in the Podman remote client, VMs created by `podman machine` now default to only using the `docker.io` registry.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed a bug where whitespace in the definition of sysctls (particularly default sysctls specified in `containers.conf`) would cause them to be parsed incorrectly.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Windows remote client improperly validated volume paths ([#10900](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10900)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the first line of logs from a container run with the `journald` log driver could be skipped.\r\n- Fixed a bug where images created by `podman commit` did not include ports exposed by the container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman auto-update` command would ignore the `io.containers.autoupdate.authfile` label when pulling images ([#11171](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11171)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--workdir` option to `podman create` and `podman run` could not be set to a directory where a volume was mounted ([#11352](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11352)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where systemd socket-activation did not properly work with systemd-managed Podman containers ([#10443](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10443)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where environment variable secrets added to a container were not available to exec sessions launched in the container.\r\n- Fixed a bug where rootless containers could fail to start the `rootlessport` port-forwarding service when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` was set to a long path.\r\n- Fixed a bug where arguments to the `--systemd` option to `podman create` and `podman run` were case-sensitive ([#11387](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11387)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman manifest rm` command would also remove images referenced by the manifest, not just the manifest itself ([#11344](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11344)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Podman remote client on OS X would not function properly if the `TMPDIR` environment variable was not set ([#11418](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11418)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `/etc/hosts` file was not guaranteed to contain an entry for `localhost` (this is still not guaranteed if `--net=host` is used; such containers will exactly match the host's `/etc/hosts`) ([#11411](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11411)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine start` command could print warnings about unsupported CPU features ([#11421](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11421)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman info` command could segfault when accessing cgroup information.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman logs -f` command could hang when a container exited ([#11461](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11461)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate systemd` command could not be used on containers that specified a restart policy ([#11438](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11438)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to build containers if the UID and GID on the client were higher than 65536 ([#11474](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11474)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman build` command would fail to build containers if the context directory was a symlink ([#11732](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11732)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--network` flag to `podman play kube` was not properly parsed when a non-bridge network configuration was specified.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman inspect` command could error when the container being inspected was removed as it was being inspected ([#11392](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11392)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman play kube` command ignored the default pod infra image specified in `containers.conf`.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format` option to `podman inspect` was nonfunctional under some circumstances ([#8785](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8785)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman run` and `podman exec` commands could skip a byte of output every 8192 bytes ([#11496](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11496)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stats` command would print nonsensical results if the container restarted while it was running ([#11469](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11469)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client would error when STDOUT was redirected on a Windows client ([#11444](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11444)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` command could return 0 when the application in the container exited with 125 ([#11540](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11540)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where containers with `--restart=always` set using the rootlessport port-forwarding service could not be restarted automatically.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--cgroups=split` option to `podman create` and `podman run` was silently discarded if the container was part of a pod.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman container runlabel` command could fail if the image name given included a tag.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could add an extra `127.0.0.1` entry to `/etc/hosts` under some circumstances ([#11596](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11596)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client's `podman untag` command did not properly handle tags including a digest ([#11557](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11557)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--format` option to `podman ps` did not properly support the `table` argument for tabular output.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `--filter` option to `podman ps` did not properly handle filtering by healthcheck status ([#11687](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11687)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman run` and `podman start --attach` commands could race when retrieving the exit code of a container that had already been removed resulting in an error (e.g. by an external `podman rm -f`) ([#11633](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11633)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command would add default environment variables to generated YAML.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman generate kube` command would add the default CMD from the image to generated YAML ([#11672](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11672)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman rm --storage` command could fail to remove containers under some circumstances ([#11207](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11207)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman machine ssh` command could fail when run on Linux ([#11731](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11731)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the `podman stop` command would error when used on a container that was already stopped ([#11740](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11740)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where renaming a container in a pod using the `podman rename` command, then removing the pod using `podman pod rm`, could cause Podman to believe the new name of the container was permanently in use, despite the container being removed ([#11750](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11750)).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n- The Libpod Pull endpoint for Images now has a new query parameter, `quiet`, which (when set to true) suppresses image pull progress reports ([#10612](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10612)).\r\n- The Compat Events endpoint now includes several deprecated fields from the Docker v1.21 API for improved compatibility with older clients.\r\n- The Compat List and Inspect endpoints for Images now prefix image IDs with `sha256:` for improved Docker compatibility ([#11623](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11623)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Containers now properly sets defaults for healthcheck-related fields ([#11225](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11225)).\r\n- The Compat Create endpoint for Containers now supports volume options provided by the `Mounts` field ([#10831](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10831)).\r\n- The Compat List endpoint for Secrets now supports a new query parameter, `filter`, which allows returned results to be filtered.\r\n- The Compat Auth endpoint now returns the correct response code (500 instead of 400) when logging into a registry fails.\r\n- The Version endpoint now includes information about the OCI runtime and Conmon in use ([#11227](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11227)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the X-Registry-Config header was not properly handled, leading to errors when pulling images ([#11235](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11235)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where invalid query parameters could cause a null pointer dereference when creating error messages.\r\n- Logging of API requests and responses at trace level has been greatly improved, including the addition of an X-Reference-Id header to correlate requests and responses ([#10053](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10053)).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Updated Buildah to v1.23.1\r\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.36.0\r\n- Updated the

This has been achieved via migration to the latest Kubernetes constructs, ease of use improvements, bug fixes and most importantly refactoring the control plane and e2e test suites to independently enhance and release each of the engines. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners will be deprecated by Dec 2021 in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them till Dec 2021. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.0.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 0.8.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.0.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 1.9.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.8.2 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.5.1 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.0.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.7.1 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.7.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.4.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.7 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* Added support for pushing the [container images to GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/packages), in addition to pushing the to DockerHub and Quay.io.\r\n* Rename the branches to \"develop\" or \"main\" on all the active repositories which are accepting contributions. \r\n* Update the CRD references to v1 across all components - even with deprecated provisioners - so users can continue to use the older provisioners beyond 1.22 as well. \r\n* Update the Kubernetes CSI driver side-cars to the latest version compatible with Kubernetes 1.18 and higher. \r\n* Enhance the iSCSI Targets functionality in Jiva and cStor volumes to only accept connections from one node at a time. The connection from a new node will be accepted only after the previous connection is torn down. \r\n* Enhanced the Local PV hostpath with a feature to enforce capacity limits using XFS quota - for volumes provisioned on XFS filesystem. \r\n* Enhanced the Jiva Specs (Jiva Volume Policy) to remove unused fields and make most of the fields with default configuration as optional. Also fixed the issues around specifying pod affinity and anti-affinity policies on jiva replica and target.\r\n* Enhanced the NDM operator and helm chart to include NDM exporter. \r\n* Enhanced NDM to detect filesystem and size changes, and update the block device resource. (under feature-gate in this release).\r\n* Dashboard and CLI have made enhanced their support to display details about cStor, Jiva, ZFS, LVM and Device Local PV. \r\n* Enhanced OpenEBS helm chart that can easily enable or disable a data engine of choice. The 3.0 helm chart stops installing the legacy cstor and jiva provisioners. If you would like to continue to use them, you have to set the flag \u201clegacy.enabled=true\u201d. \r\n* OpenEBS helm chart includes sample kyverno policies that can be used as an option for PodSecurityPolicies(PSP) replacement. \r\n* New revamped website for [https://openebs.io](https://openebs.io) is live. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @turowicz(Surveily), @WillyRL(Teknologi Anak Rantau Indonesia), @Somsubhra1, @t3hmrman for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

This should eliminate the capture of some irrelevant build environment attributes in produced artifacts, improve consistency between builds, and reduce the file level diff between release artifacts.\r\n\r\n    GitHub issue: [#3442](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3442)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Classic queue shutdown now uses a much higher timeout (up to 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds).\r\n\r\n   In environments with many queues (especially mirrored queues) and many consumers this means that\r\n   the chance of queue indices rebuilding after node restart is now substantially lower.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3409](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3409)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Quorum queues no longer leak memory and disk space when a consumer is repeatedly added and cancelled on an empty queue.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3445](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3445)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * More configurability for metrics exposed via the Prometheus endpoint.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3421](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3421)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Shovel URIs could be logged with credentials in some scenarios.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3476](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3476), contributed by @thuandb (AWS)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n * observer_cli has been upgraded from `1.6.2` to `1.7.1`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.9.7.tar.xz` instead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2021-09-24T05:32:45Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v2.4.0", "tag_name": "v2.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/drone/drone/releases/tag/v2.4.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/drone/drone", "body": "", "created_at": "2021-09-23T09:07:24Z", "project": "Drone", "repo": "drone/drone", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Beats 7.15.0", "tag_name": "v7.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/beats/releases/tag/v7.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/beats", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/beats\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/7.15/release-notes-7.15.0.html", "created_at": "2021-09-22T15:51:57Z", "project": "Beats", "repo": "elastic/beats", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Kibana 7.15.0", "tag_name": "v7.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/kibana/releases/tag/v7.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/kibana", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/kibana\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.15/release-notes-7.15.0.html", "created_at": "2021-09-22T15:51:57Z", "project": "Kibana", "repo": "elastic/kibana", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Elasticsearch 7.15.0", "tag_name": "v7.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/releases/tag/v7.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/release-notes-7.15.0.html", "created_at": "2021-09-22T15:51:57Z", "project": "Elasticsearch", "repo": "elastic/elasticsearch", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Logstash 7.15.0", "tag_name": "v7.15.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elastic/logstash/releases/tag/v7.15.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/elastic/logstash", "body": "Downloads: https://elastic.co/downloads/logstash\nRelease notes: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/7.15/logstash-7-15-0.html", "created_at": "2021-09-22T15:51:57Z", "project": "Logstash", "repo": "elastic/logstash", "type": "Log", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.23.2", "tag_name": "v1.23.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.23.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube", "body": "\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\ude00 **Please fill out our [fast 5-question survey](https://forms.gle/Gg3hG5ZySw8c1C24A)** so that we can learn how & why you use minikube, and what improvements we should make.

If upgrading from Tempo v0.6.0 or earlier, then see the special upgrade instructions below.  Tempo v0.7.0 and later have no compatibility issues or special instructions.   \r\n\r\nTempo v0.6.0 and earlier used block formats v0 and v1, which are being deprecated, and support for these blocks will be removed in the next release.  To resolve this you must first upgrade to Tempo 0.7.0+ (latest 1.1 is recommended) which introduces the supported v2 block format.  Tempo will write all new blocks as v2, and it must continue running until all v0 and v1 blocks are gone (either deleted due to retention, or compacted).   Block versions can be checked using the tempo-cli [list blocks command](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/operations/tempo_cli/#list-blocks).\r\n\r\n## New Features and Enhancements\r\n[FEATURE] Added the ability to hedge requests with all backends #750 (@joe-elliott)\r\n[FEATURE] Added a tenant index to reduce bucket polling. #834 (@joe-elliott)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Added hedged request metric tempodb_backend_hedged_roundtrips_total and a new storage agnostic tempodb_backend_request_duration_seconds metric that supersedes the soon-to-be deprecated storage specific metrics (tempodb_azure_request_duration_seconds, tempodb_s3_request_duration_seconds and tempodb_gcs_request_duration_seconds). #790 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Performance: improve compaction speed with concurrent reads and writes #754 (@mdisibio)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Improve readability of cpu and memory metrics on operational dashboard #764 (@bboreham)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add azure_request_duration_seconds metric. #767 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add s3_request_duration_seconds metric. #776 (@JosephWoodward)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add tempo_ingester_flush_size_bytes metric. #777 (@bboreham)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Microservices jsonnet: resource requests and limits can be set in $._config. #793 (@kvrhdn)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add -config.expand-env cli flag to support environment variables expansion in config file. #796 (@Ashmita152)\r\n[ENHANCEMENT] Add ability to control bloom filter caching based on age and/or compaction level.

Thank you!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Chunks storage has been deprecated and is now in maintenance mode.\r\n* Exemplars now supported - in-memory only.\r\n* Added many new limits, to help protect your installation against overload.\r\n* The sharding feature in Alertmanager is now considered complete.\r\n* Release now has ARM binaries and packages (but not container images, yet).\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Prevent path traversal attack from users able to control the HTTP header `X-Scope-OrgID`. #4375 (CVE-2021-36157)\r\n  * Users only have control of the HTTP header when Cortex is not frontended by an auth proxy validating the tenant IDs\r\n* [CHANGE] Enable strict JSON unmarshal for `pkg/util/validation.Limits` struct. The custom `UnmarshalJSON()` will now fail if the input has unknown fields. #4298\r\n* [CHANGE] Cortex chunks storage has been deprecated and it's now in maintenance mode: all Cortex users are encouraged to migrate to the blocks storage. No new features will be added to the chunks storage. The default Cortex configuration still runs the chunks engine; please check out the [blocks storage doc](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/) on how to configure Cortex to run with the blocks storage.  #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] The example Kubernetes manifests (stored at `k8s/`) have been removed due to a lack of proper support and maintenance. #4268\r\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: deprecated `-store.query-chunk-limit` CLI flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`) in favour of `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`). The new limit specifies the maximum number of chunks that can be fetched in a single query from ingesters and long-term storage: the total number of actual fetched chunks could be 2x the limit, being independently applied when querying ingesters and long-term storage. #4125\r\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: allowed to configure the experimental receivers firewall on a per-tenant basis. The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been changed and moved to the limits config section: #4143\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.cidr-networks` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-cidr-networks`\r\n  - `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall.block.private-addresses` renamed to `-alertmanager.receivers-firewall-block-private-addresses`\r\n* [CHANGE] Change default value of `-server.grpc.keepalive.min-time-between-pings` from `5m` to `10s` and `-server.grpc.keepalive.ping-without-stream-allowed` to `true`. #4168\r\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change default value of `-ingester.active-series-metrics-enabled` to `true`. This incurs a small increase in memory usage, between 1.2% and 1.6% as measured on ingesters with 1.3M active series. #4257\r\n* [CHANGE] Dependency: update go-redis from v8.2.3 to v8.9.0. #4236\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max series per query limit is enforced in the querier and applies to unique series received from ingesters and store-gateway (long-term storage). #4179\r\n* [FEATURE] Querier/Ruler: Added new `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query` flag. When Cortex is running with blocks storage, the max chunk bytes limit is enforced in the querier and ruler and limits the size of all aggregated chunks returned from ingesters and storage as bytes for a query. #4216\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: support negative matchers, time-based muting - [upstream release notes](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/tag/v0.22.0). #4237\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added rate-limits to notifiers. Rate limits used by all integrations can be configured using `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit`, while per-integration rate limits can be specified via `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration` parameter. Both shared and per-integration limits can be overwritten using overrides mechanism. These limits are applied on individual (per-tenant) alertmanagers. Rate-limited notifications are failed notifications. It is possible to monitor rate-limited notifications via new `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total` metric. #4135 #4163\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes` limit to control size of configuration files that Cortex users can upload to Alertmanager via API. This limit is configurable per-tenant. #4201\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-templates-count` and `-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes` options to control number and size of templates uploaded to Alertmanager via API. These limits are configurable per-tenant. #4223\r\n* [FEATURE] Added flag `-debug.block-profile-rate` to enable goroutine blocking events profiling. #4217\r\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: The experimental sharding feature is now considered complete. Detailed information about the configuration options can be found [here for alertmanager](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) and [here for the alertmanager storage](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_storage_config). To use the feature: #3925 #4020 #4021 #4031 #4084 #4110 #4126 #4127 #4141 #4146 #4161 #4162 #4222\r\n  * Ensure that a remote storage backend is configured for Alertmanager to store state using `-alertmanager-storage.backend`, and flags related to the backend. Note that the `local` and `configdb` storage backends are not supported.\r\n  * Ensure that a ring store is configured using `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store`, and set the flags relevant to the chosen store type.\r\n  * Enable the feature using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`.\r\n  * Note the prior addition of a new configuration option `-alertmanager.persist-interval`. This sets the interval between persisting the current alertmanager state (notification log and silences) to object storage. See the [configuration file reference](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/configuration-file/#alertmanager_config) for more information.\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Cleanup persisted state objects from remote storage when a tenant configuration is deleted. #4167\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Added the ability to disable Open Census within GCS client (e.g `-gcs.enable-opencensus=false`). #4219\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Etcd: Added username and password to etcd config. #4205\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: introduced new metrics to monitor operation when using `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`: #4149\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_completed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_initial_sync_duration_seconds`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_total`\r\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_persist_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks storage: support ingesting exemplars and querying of exemplars.  Enabled by setting new CLI flag `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-exemplars=<n>` or config option `blocks_storage.tsdb.max_exemplars` to positive value. #4124 #4181\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added distributors ring status section in the admin page. #4151\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added zone-awareness support to alertmanager for use when sharding is enabled. When zone-awareness is enabled, alerts will be replicated across availability zones. #4204\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `tenant_ids` tag to tracing spans #4186\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring, query-frontend: Avoid using automatic private IPs (APIPA) when discovering IP address from the interface during the registration of the instance in the ring, or by query-frontend when used with query-scheduler. APIPA still used as last resort with logging indicating usage. #4032\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: introduced new metrics to aid troubleshooting tombstone convergence: #4231\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_kv_store_value_tombstones_removed_total`\r\n  * `memberlist_client_messages_to_broadcast_dropped_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups` option to control max number of active dispatcher groups in Alertmanager (per tenant, also overrideable). When the limit is reached, Dispatcher produces log message and increases `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_group_limit_reached_total` metric. #4254\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.max-alerts-count` and `-alertmanager.max-alerts-size-bytes` to control max number of alerts and total size of alerts that a single user can have in Alertmanager's memory. Adding more alerts will fail with a log message and incrementing `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_insert_limited_total` metric (per-user). These limits can be overrided by using per-tenant overrides. Current values are tracked in `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts` and `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_limiter_current_alerts_size_bytes` metrics. #4253\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` and `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-max-duration` support to store-gateway, to wait for ring stability at startup. #4271\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added `rule_group` label to metrics `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_total` and `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total`. #4121\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added new metrics for tracking total number of queries and push requests sent to ingester, as well as failed queries and push requests. Failures are only counted for internal errors, but not user-errors like limits or invalid query. This is in contrast to existing `cortex_prometheus_rule_evaluation_failures_total`, which is incremented also when query or samples appending fails due to user-errors. #4281\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_write_requests_failed_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_total`\r\n  * `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Added option `-ingester.ignore-series-limit-for-metric-names` with comma-separated list of metric names that will be ignored in max series per metric limit. #4302\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added instrumentation to Redis client, with the following metrics: #3976\r\n  - `cortex_rediscache_request_duration_seconds`\r\n* [BUGFIX] Purger: fix `Invalid null value in condition for column range` caused by `nil` value in range for WriteBatch query. #4128\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed infrequent panic caused by a race condition between TSDB mmap-ed head chunks truncation and queries. #4176\r\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: fix Alertmanager status page if clustering via gossip is disabled or sharding is enabled. #4184\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix `/ruler/rule_groups` endpoint doesn't work when used with object store. #4182\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Honor the evaluation delay for the `ALERTS` and `ALERTS_FOR_STATE` series. #4227\r\n* [BUGFIX] Make multiple Get requests instead of MGet on Redis Cluster. #4056\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix issue where runtime limits erroneously override default limits. #4246\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix startup in single-binary mode when the new `ruler_storage` is used. #4252\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix queries failing with \"at least 1 healthy replica required, could only find 0\" error right after scaling up store-gateways until they're ACTIVE in the ring. #4263\r\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: when blocks sharding is enabled, do not load all blocks in each store-gateway in case of a cold startup, but load only blocks owned by the store-gateway replica. #4271\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fix to setting the default configuration value for `-memberlist.retransmit-factor` when not provided. This should improve propagation delay of the ring state (including, but not limited to, tombstones). Note that if the configuration is already explicitly given, this fix has no effect. #4269\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix issue where samples in a chunk might get skipped by batch iterator. #4218\r\n\r\n## Blocksconvert\r\n\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: add support for DynamoDB (v9 schema only). #3828\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add Cassandra support. #3795\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scanner: retry failed uploads. #4188\r\n", "created_at": "2021-08-05T09:18:00Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "2.0.3 (July 28, 2021)", "tag_name": "2.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases/tag/2.0.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos", "body": "In this version, Nacos community continue to do a lot of optimizations for the features of the upgrade from 1.X to 2.0.X, to improve the upgrade stability.

Our community has grown a lot over the years, but it is always in need of more hands!\r\n\r\n## Multi-architecture Docker images\r\nZipkin's Docker image is now available for arm64 architecture. This eases Raspberry Pi (RPI) K8s deployment and [Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as you no longer have to build your own image. This also enables users who use Zipkin in their build pipeline to be unblocked from switching to arm64.\r\n\r\nZipkin's server is written in Java, and hosts web assets run in a client's browser. White there are a few optional native optimizations at the Netty (I/O) layer, it has no operating system or architecture restrictions. That said, a significant amount of our user base use our Docker images. These users are restricted to our OS and architecture choices, as manifest in the Docker build. To allow arm64 was a bigger change than it seemed. We use Alpine Linux and our JDK distribution had to change because Zulu (or former choice) didn't support arm64. Also, publishing multi-architecture seems simple, but it is definitely more complicated, especially on developer laptops. We had to perform significant build work, including use of [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) and [qemu to emulate arm64](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/setup_multiarch_docker) when not running it. Many thanks to the lead @adrianfcole and advice by @dmfrey, @odidev and @anuraaga.\r\n\r\nWhile users can now use arm64, our job isn't quite over. We also want to run our own build on Arm64! This allows us to do integration tests. While we surmounted some hurdles running our [NPM build on Alpine](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/build-bin/go_offline), but @odidev noticed a blocker on [Cassandra](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16212#]. After that, we'd still need to update our GitHub actions and Travis jobs to use the arch (ex for pull requests). If you are interested in this and can lend a hand, please say so on [this issue](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3166).\r\n\r\n## We now publish our Docker images to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\nZipkin is a technology often integrated into other stacks. We've always been conscious about our impacts here. Apart from optional storage and messaging transports, we've never required a multi-image deployment even when Zipkin is run in different roles. This has helped you download (docker pull) less often.\r\n\r\nWe also made the lower overhead \"openzipkin/zipkin-slim\" image, as well test Kafka and storage images which share layers. Our base layer uses a custom \"jlinked\" JRE image which is less than 100MB. We almost famously guard any changes to the server that would bloat anything. We aren't done, but our volunteers have put immense effort on your behalf to keep you pulling less and less often.\r\n\r\nMany open source developers were nervous for good reason about Docker Hub's usage policy starting [November 1st](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-image-retention-policy-delayed-and-subscription-updates/). This implies three things for open source developers using Docker Hub (ex. `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`).\r\n* you likely have to authenticate now\r\n* you are restricted to 200 pulls per 6hrs\r\n* images you make that aren't pulled in 6 months will (eventually) be purged\r\n\r\nThe first point impacts people's pipelines. In any open community authenticating can be a pain. Using personal credentials for community work can feel conflicted. The second point is more dire. Many are simply not aware how often the pull from Docker Hub!\r\n\r\nFor example, OpenZipkin community defines \"latest\", the default tag, as \"latest release\" meaning that if you run `docker pull openzipkin/zipkin`, it will only consume your pull request quota if you are rebuilding your image cache, or we released a new version. While we release new versions somewhat often, it isn't enough to worry about. However, many projects treat \"latest\" as *every commit*. This means depending on what image you depend on, it could change more than once per hour. To run tests in some projects require pulling such images. To amplify this, some developers volunteer time on many projects. The amplification of these factors means that a volunteer making no money at all can become forced into a subscription to pay for the privilege to do that.\r\n\r\nThe final point on retention is also tricky. Many expect images to never disappear. While we always want people to upgrade, we don't want people to be surprised that something they've cached in house for a while cannot be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nOpenZipkin is and will always be free in spirit and practice. We will not force our volunteers or end users into any subscription. To address this issue quickly, we decided to publish images also to GitHub Container Registry. This is currently free and not rate-limited on consumption. If that changes, we will publish issues also to another registry :P\r\n\r\nFor those reading this and wondering what this means, it means the following. Our primary source of images is now [here](https://github.com/orgs/openzipkin/packages). The top-level images, including our server and test backends are also pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openzipkin) for convenience. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change your build or deployment process to use a non rate-limited image, it is as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n+docker run -d -p 9411:9411 ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full impact of this required a lot of change to our build process, even if GitHub Container Registry is pretty easy. For example, to set descriptions there, we had to add some standard labels to our images. While we were at it, we added more labels:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}'  ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin-slim|jq\r\n{\r\n  \"alpine-version\": \"3.12.1\",\r\n  \"java-version\": \"15.0.1_p9\",\r\n  \"maintainer\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"OpenZipkin https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Zipkin slim distribution on OpenJDK and Alpine Linux\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.source\": \"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin\",\r\n  \"org.opencontainers.image.version\": \"2.22.1\",\r\n  \"zipkin-version\": \"2.22.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process was a lot of work and we thank @adriancole for the bulk of it. However, it was not possible without team input, particularly credential management and other knowledge sharing to make practice sustainable.
