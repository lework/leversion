recommended** that you read [4.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.2.0)\r\nin detail if upgrading from a version prior to `4.2.0`.\r\n\r\n### Minimum Supported Erlang Version\r\n\r\n[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\nNodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v4.2.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Fixes a binding deletion-related memory leak in Khepri.\r\n\r\n   This leak primarily affected systems with high binding churn.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15024](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/15024)\r\n\r\n * Corrected a performance regression around metric collection that could have a meaningful impact on quorum queues.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/seshat#16](https://github.com/rabbitmq/seshat/pull/16)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 link error frames did not have settlement set in certain failure scenarios,\r\n   namely when attaching a link failed due to a missing source (queue or stream).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15004](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15004)\r\n\r\n * AMQP 1.0 clients that publish messages without a body now get a clearer error message.\r\n   Messages without a body explicitly violate the AMQP 1.0 specification.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15048](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15048)\r\n\r\n * Default operator policy pre-configuration in `rabbitmq.conf` were unintentionally missing a key,\r\n   `default_policies.operator.$id.apply_to`, for controlling what objects the policy applies to.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14988](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/14988)\r\n\r\n * Definition import is now more defensive when importing exchanges.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15128](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/15128)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * More efficient Khepri (metadata store) querying.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/khepri#349](https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri/pull/349)\r\n\r\n * Removed a cool down delay between stream chunk redelivery attempts.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14766](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/14766)\r\n\r\n * Stream data directory can now be configured via `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15014](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15014)\r\n\r\n * Stream replication: IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6) can now be configured via `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15012](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15012)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * When multiple resource server IDs are configured, management UI login screen now provides a way to pre-select a specific resource ID\r\n   before logging in.\r\n\r\n   As part of this change, when multiple resource server IDs are configured, their order stored internally now reflects\r\n   that in `rabbitmq.conf`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15044](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15044)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `GET /api/deprecated-features/used` no longer returns an empty `state` field.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14340](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/14340)\r\n\r\n * Feature flag icons now contrast well when the dark mode is used in the UI.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14620](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/14620)\r\n\r\n * Corrected an invalid `apply_to` value (`classic_queue` instead of `classic_queues`)\r\n   on the policy declaration form.\r\n\r\n   Declaring a policy \"directly\" via the HTTP API was not affected.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15054](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15054)\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Queue declaration form fields were reordered so that the queue type dropdown comes before\r\n   the virtual host.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15017](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15017)\r\n\r\n * The order of configured OAuth 2 resource servers is now preserved in the management UI.\r\n   Additionally, a resource server ID can now be pre-selected during service-provider-initiated logons.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15044](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15044)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `GET /metrics/per-object` responses on systems with thousands of objections now takes 20-30% less time.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15035](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15035)\r\n\r\n * Prometheus scraping endpoint responses are now streamed instead of being fully buffered before transmission.\r\n   This reduces memory peak footprint and improves response times for nodes with a larger number of objects.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15018](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15018)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Fixed a dependency loading issue with `ddskerl` (a Prometheus library dependency)\r\n   that could cause `stop_app` to fail.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15027](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15027)\r\n\r\n\r\n### CLI Tools\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * `rabbitmq-queues quorum_status` could run into an exception when a quorum queue member dies before recording any metrics.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15003](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15003)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web MQTT Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The plugin now supports the `mqttv3.1` WebSocket subprotocol in addition to `mqtt`,\r\n   improving compatibility with older MQTT clients.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15009](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15009)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AWS Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The plugin now uses IPv6 discovery endpoints in IPv6-only environments.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14974](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/14974)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tracing Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Trace files served via the management UI now include proper UTF-8 charset specification.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#14970](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/14970)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Trust Store Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * The plugin now merges user-provided TLS options with the options it needs in a safer manner.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#15116](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15116)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\n * `khepri` was upgraded to [`0.17.3`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/khepri/releases/tag/v0.17.3)\r\n * `seshat` was upgraded to [`1.0.1`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/seshat/releases/tag/v1.0.1)\r\n", "created_at": "2025-12-15T17:48:56Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting":

[#62194](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62194)\n* Fixed an Auth Service bug causing the event handler to miss up to 1 event every 5 minutes when storing audit events in S3. [#62150](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62150)\n* Fixed bug where event handler dies on malformed session events. [#62141](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62141)\n* Updated event handler to ingest missing session recordings at twice the `concurrency` instead of only 10 sessions at a time. [#62141](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62141)\n* Changed &#34;tsh --mfa-mode=cross-platform&#34; to favor security keys on current Windows versions. [#62134](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62134)\n* Fixed &#34;the client connection is closing&#34; error happening under certain conditions in Teleport Connect when connecting to resources with per-session MFA enabled. [#62127](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62127)\n* Improved detail of error messages for `identity` service in `tbot`. [#62120](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62120)\n* Teleport Connect now supports expanding `~/` home-directory paths in the configuration file. [#62104](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62104)\n* Added support for --format flag for `tsh request search`. [#62099](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62099)\n* Fixed bug where event handler `types` filter is ignored for Teleport clients using Athena storage backend. [#62082](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62082)\n* Fixed intermittent issues with VNet on Windows when other NRPT rules from GPOs are present under `HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\DNSClient\\DnsPolicyConfig`. [#62052](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62052)\n* Added Terraform provider support for teleport_integration resources. [#62040](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62040)\n* DiscoveryConfig resources can now be managed via the Teleport Terraform Provider. [#62034](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62034)\n* Reduced memory consumption of the Application service. [#62014](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62014)\n* Added support for listing application session recordings in `tsh recording ls` and the Web UI. [#62010](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/62010)\n* Fixed a Web UI issue where the copy button for the session ID did not work for non-interactive session recordings.

[#61947](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/61947)\n* Re-enabled MySQL database health checks. MySQL health checks will now authenticate to the database as a user, rather than TCP dialing and closing the connection, to prevent MySQL from automatically blocking the Teleport database service instance host. The health check user name default is &#34;teleport-healthchecker&#34;. [#61942](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/61942)\n* Added support for templating `secret_labels`, and the `{{.Labels}}` template variable, to tbot&#39;s `kubernetes/argo-cd` output.

See [#9796](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/9796). Thanks to @sylr for the contribution.\r\n* FEATURE: `vminsert` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): improve slowness-based rerouting logic. Now rerouting occurs only for the slowest storage node, and only if the cluster as a whole has enough available capacity to handle the additional load. This prevents unnecessary rerouting when the entire cluster is under heavy load or avoid \"rerouting storm\". The logic is disabled by default; to enable set `-disableRerouting=false`. See [#9890](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9890) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent/): add support of [Zabbix Connector](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/integrations/zabbixconnector/#send-data-from-zabbix-connector) ingestion format.

See [#10075](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10075).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: all VictoriaMetrics components: properly validate remaining system memory limit. Previously it could have negative values. See [#10083](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/10083).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/): don't increase `vmalert_alerting_rules_errors_total`/`vmalert_recording_rules_errors_total` for request context cancellation, which may occur during graceful shutdown or group configuration update. See [#10128](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/10128). Thanks to @tIGO for the contribution.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/): verify backend network reachability with a TCP dial before marking it healthy. Previously, backends were auto-restored after `-failTimeout` even if the network was still unreachable, causing requests to hang repeatedly. `vmauth` now performs a 1s TCP dial check before returning a backend to the healthy pool. See [#9997](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/9997).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmctl/): properly handle process termination during prompt confirmation.

This makes it clear when a cache is full and an action needs to be taken (such as adding more memory or adjusting cache limits). See [#10131](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/10131).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmsingle](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/) and `vmselect` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): disable rollup result cache for [instant queries](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/keyConcepts.html#instant-query) that contain [`rate`](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rate) function with a lookbehind window larger than `-search.minWindowForInstantRollupOptimization`. Previously, utilizing the cache might yield incorrect results when time series samples are not continuous. See [#10098](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victoriaMetrics/issues/10098).\r\n* BUGFIX: `vmstorage` in [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/cluster-victoriametrics/): do not wait after closing the last connections from vminsert when shutting down.

with Native Histograms as a stable feature. However, scraping Native Histograms has to be activated explicitly via the `scrape_native_histograms` config setting (newly introduced in this release). To ease the transition, the `--enable-feature=native-histograms` flag is not a complete no-op in this release, but changes the default value of `scrape_native_histograms` to `true`. In the next release (v3.9), the feature flag _will_ be a complete no-op, and the default value of `scrape_native_histograms` will always be `false`. If you have been using the feature flag so far, the recommended course of action is the following:\r\n1. Upgrade to v3.8 and keep the feature flag. Everything should work as before.\r\n2. At your own pace, set `scrape_native_histograms` to `true` in all relevant scrape configs. (There is a global and a per-scrape-config version of  `scrape_native_histograms`, allowing granular control if needed. It is a good idea to also set `scrape_native_histograms` explicitly to `false` where you do not want to scrape Native Histograms. In this way, you do not depend on the default value of the setting anymore.)\r\n3. Remove the feature flag and make sure that everything still works as intended.\r\n4. Now you are ready for an upgrade to the next release (v3.9).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Remote-write 2 (receiving): Update to [2.0-rc.4 spec](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/60c24e450010df38cfcb4f65df874f6f9b26dbcb/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec_2_0.md). \"created timestamp\" (CT) is now called \"start timestamp\" (ST). #17411\r\n* [CHANGE] TSDB: Native Histogram Custom Bounds with a NaN threshold are now rejected. #17287\r\n* [FEATURE] OAuth2: support jwt-bearer grant-type (RFC7523 3.1). #17592\r\n* [FEATURE] Dockerfile: Add OpenContainers spec labels to Dockerfile. #16483\r\n* [FEATURE] SD: Add unified AWS service discovery for ec2, lightsail and ecs services. #17046\r\n* [FEATURE] Native histograms are now a stable, but optional feature, use the `scrape_native_histograms` config setting. #17232 #17315\r\n* [FEATURE] UI: Support anchored and smoothed keyword in promql editor. #17239\r\n* [FEATURE] UI: Show detailed relabeling steps for each discovered target. #17337\r\n* [FEATURE] Alerting: Add urlQueryEscape to template functions. #17403\r\n* [FEATURE] Promtool: Add  Remote-Write 2.0 support to `promtool push metrics` via the `--protobuf_message` flag. #17417\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify the docs about handling negative native histograms.  #17249\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mixin: Add static UID to the remote-write dashboard. #17256\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] PromQL: Reconcile mismatched NHCB bounds in `Add` and `Sub`. #17278\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerting: Add \"unknown\" state for alerting rules that haven't been evaluated yet. #17282\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Scrape: Allow simultaneous use of classic histogram \u2192 NHCB conversion and zero-timestamp ingestion. #17305\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Add smoothed/anchored in explain. #17334\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: De-duplicate any `target_info` samples with the same timestamp for the same series. #17400\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Document `use_fips_sts_endpoint` in `sigv4` config sections. #17304\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Document Prometheus Agent. #14519\r\n* [PERF] PromQL: Speed up parsing of variadic functions. #17316\r\n* [PERF] UI: Speed up alerts/rules/... pages by not rendering collapsed content. #17485\r\n* [PERF] UI: Performance improvement when getting label name and values in promql editor. #17194\r\n* [PERF] UI: Speed up /alerts for many firing alerts via virtual scrolling.  #17254\r\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix slice indexing bug in info function on churning series. #17199\r\n* [BUGFIX] API: Reduce lock contention on `/api/v1/targets`. #17306\r\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Consistent handling of gauge vs. counter histograms in aggregations. #17312\r\n* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Allow NHCB with -Inf as the first custom value. #17320\r\n* [BUGFIX] UI: Fix duplicate loading of data from the API speed up rendering of some pages. #17357\r\n* [BUGFIX] Old UI: Fix createExpressionLink to correctly build /graph URLs so links from Alerts/Rules work again. #17365\r\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Avoid panic when parsing malformed `info` call. #17379\r\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Include histograms when enforcing sample_limit. #17390\r\n* [BUGFIX] Config: Fix panic if TLS CA file is absent. #17418\r\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix `histogram_fraction` for classic histograms and NHCB if lower bound is in the first bucket. #17424\r\n", "created_at": "2025-12-02T09:06:03Z", "project": "Prometheus", "repo": "prometheus/prometheus", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v5.0.0 \"Mont Blanc\"", "tag_name": "v5.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v5.0.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/docker/compose", "body": "![mont blanc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6b938e-e67a-4063-b1d0-0f225da01521)\r\n\r\nMajor changes in this release:\r\n* Compose can now officially be used as a SDK to be integrated into third-party softwares\r\n* Internal builder has been removed, build is delegated to Docker Bake (same as `docker build` command) \r\n\r\n## Why \"v5\" ?\r\nWe decided to skip `3.0.0` for next major release after docker Compose v2 to prevent (more) confusion with the obsolete docker-compose file versions `2.x` and `3.x` inherited from Docker Compose v1.

They can be corrected by either of two methods:\r\n>\r\n> * Updating the Relying Party Trust information from federation metadata (Relying Party Trust -> Update from Federation Metadata...)\r\n> * Directly adding the certificate (Relying Party Trust -> Properties -> Signature tab -> Add -> Select the certificate).\r\n>\r\n> For more information see [#48655](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48655).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** [Rancher-Istio](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/integrations-in-rancher/istio) has been deprecated in Rancher v2.12.0; turn to the [SUSE Application Collection](https://apps.rancher.io) build of Istio for enhanced security (included in SUSE Rancher Prime subscriptions). Detailed information can be found in [this announcement](https://forums.suse.com/t/deprecation-of-rancher-istio/45043).\r\n\r\nRancher v2.13.0 is the latest minor release of Rancher. This is a Community version release that introduces new features, enhancements, and various updates.\r\n\r\n## Rancher General\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now supports Kubernetes v1.34. See [#51252](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51252) for information on Rancher support for Kubernetes v1.34. You can view the upstream Kubernetes changelogs for [v1.34](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md) for a complete list of changes.\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- Official support for Kubernetes v1.31 and older versions has been removed. You can no longer provision new RKE2 or K3s clusters using the Kubernetes versions that fall outside of the supported range (v1.32 - v1.34). See [#51253](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51253).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the cluster-scoped `v1.ext.cattle.io` APIService was not correctly deleted during a Rancher Helm uninstall, leading to a \"dangling\" API service. See [#51976](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51976).\r\n\r\n## Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Introduced an optimized view for the Cluster List on the Home Page, powered by Server-Side Pagination (SSP). This enhancement improves the load time and UI experience for users managing a large number of Kubernetes clusters. See [#15569](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15569) and [#15570](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15570).\r\n- Introduced support for dynamic content on the Rancher Manager Home screen, allowing timely information, such as product announcements, new releases, feature highlights, and relevant updates to be displayed upon logging in. See [#15342](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15342).\r\n- Rancher Default and Prime themes have been refreshed. See [#15166](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15166).\r\n- Introduced a Cron Editor component, providing a user interface for defining and managing CronJob schedules. See [#14341](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/14341).\r\n\r\n### Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- The Rancher UI for provisioning hosted Kubernetes clusters (AKS, EKS, and GKE) has been updated to align with the new Cluster Provisioning v2 (kev2) framework. This change replaces the reliance on the older kontainerdriver (kev1) resources to determine which hosted providers are available for display. The UI now uses a new setting to manage the visibility of these providers, ensuring consistency and future compatibility. See [#15391](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15391).\r\n- Rancher's session inactivity logic has been moved from the UI to the backend. A new session TTL setting `auth-user-session-idle-ttl-minutes` was introduced, and it sets the maximum time a user is allowed to be idle within a browser session before the session expires. To enable the idle timeout feature, you must supply `auth-user-session-idle-ttl-minutes` and set it to a value lower than the existing absolute session limit, `auth-user-session-ttl-minutes`. This new backend-driven mechanism, along with its associated TTL setting, replaces the previous session timeout configuration in the UI under **Global Settings** > **Performance**. See [#12552](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12552).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where when registering a Rancher Manager instance with SCC, the **Status** field in the Rancher UI failed to update. See [#14985](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/14985).\r\n- Fixed an issue where when attempting to register Rancher Manager with an invalid SUSE Customer Center (SCC) registration code resulted in a misleading error message and the UI would incorrectly suggest connection issues instead of stating that the Registration Code was invalid. See [#14940](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/14940).\r\n- Fixed an issue affecting RKE2 clusters provisioned with the Nutanix Node Driver, where editing any cluster setting (like changing the Kubernetes version) would incorrectly modify and clear the `vmNetwork` field in the underlying Nutanix machine pool configuration (setting it to null). This caused the nodes to start reprovisioning and fail with a `nutanix-vm-network cannot be empty` error. See [#15269](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15269).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- In an air-gapped environment, when attempting to access the legacy v3 API-UI page directly via the host URL (`<RANCHER-SERVER-URL>/v3`), the page fails to load and displays a blank page. See [#52790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52790).\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- In environments using GitHub, you can configure the new GitHub App authentication provider in Rancher, which allows users to authenticate against a GitHub Organization account using a dedicated [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview). This new provider runs alongside the existing standard GitHub authentication provider, offering increased security and better management of permissions based on GitHub Organization teams. See [#50517](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/50517).\r\n- Rancher supports the ability to configure OIDC Single Logout (SLO). See [#49013](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/49013).\r\n- Rancher no longer stores user tokens for the Generic OIDC and Cognito authentication providers. An automatic cleaner has been implemented to remove any previously stored tokens for Generic OIDC and Cognito during the upgrade process. See [#52136](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52136).\r\n- Rancher now provides Terraform resource support for managing the Generic OIDC authentication provider through Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This enhancement allows users to programmatically configure, enable, and disable Generic OIDC authentication, including setting endpoints, client secrets, and claims mappings, directly using the `rancher2_auth_config_oidc` resource within `terraform-provider-rancher2`. See [#51059](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51059).\r\n\r\n## Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Rancher now includes initial support for IPv6, providing the foundational capabilities needed to manage clusters using IPv6 addressing. You can deploy Rancher on IPv6-only or dual-stack clusters, and you can provision IPv6-only or dual-stack clusters on Amazon EC2 or DigitalOcean using node drivers, as well as create custom clusters with IPv6 or dual-stack support. See [#49689](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/49689).\r\n- Rancher now uses Rancher Turtles as the default component for providing Cluster API (CAPI) controllers and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) necessary for RKE2 and K3s cluster provisioning (v2prov). This change replaces the previous Rancher Provisioning component. Upon upgrade, the Rancher Provisioning chart is automatically uninstalled from the Rancher management cluster and replaced with the Rancher Turtles chart. See [#52254](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52254).\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where Standard Users assigned the Cluster Owner role on a downstream cluster were unable to view or restore existing etcd snapshots via the Rancher UI. Cluster Owners now have the correct permissions to see and restore snapshots as expected. See [#52307](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52307).\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Cluster provisioning is not working as expected in air-gapped Rancher setups due to `capi-controller-manager` not coming up **Active**. See [#52816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52816). To resolve this issue, refer to this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52816#issuecomment-3560265414).\r\n- Provisioning or importing an Amazon EKS downstream cluster fails when the Rancher Server is running in an IPv6-only or dual-stack environment. See [#52154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/52154).\r\n\r\n## Rancher Webhook\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue related to Project Resource Quotas that led to the incorrect calculation of `usedLimit` values and subsequent admission webhook errors. The webhook validation now correctly checks the new desired quota state against the calculated usage, preventing errors when saving correct limits. `usedLimit` is dropped when a project is new and has no namespaces to prevent persistence of stale or user-provided, bogus values. See [#49041](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/49041).\r\n\r\n## K3s Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- When attempting to provision an IPv6-only K3s cluster (either Custom or Node-Driver) with IPv6 CIDRs, the cluster becomes stuck in a provisioning state and does not become **Active**. This issue will be addressed in RKE2/K3s November 2025 releases that will be made available via corresponding KDM release. See [#51990](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51990).\r\n\r\n## RKE2 Provisioning\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- When provisioning a Custom RKE2 cluster where the nodes are configured with IPv6-only addresses, the cluster fails to provision correctly. Specifically, the `rke2-server` service on the etcd-only nodes crashes repeatedly with a fatal error: `runtimes: failed to get runtime classes`. As a result, the etcd node is continually seen flipping between **Waiting for Node Ref** and **Reconciling** status, preventing the cluster from reaching an **Active** state. Fixes will be delivered via the November RKE2/K3s KDM release. See [#51851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51851).\r\n\r\n## Backup/Restore\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- When performing a rollback from Rancher v2.13.0 to v2.12.3 using the backup and restore operator (BRO), the restore does not complete successfully. See [#844](https://github.com/rancher/backup-restore-operator/issues/844). To work around this issue, you must scale down your Rancher deployment and uninstall the Webhook chart before performing the restore. For details, refer to this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.scc.suse.com/s/kb/Rolling-back-from-Rancher-v2-13-0-to-v2-12-3?language=en_US).\r\n\r\n## Continuous Delivery (Fleet)\r\n\r\n### Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where attempting to uninstall Rancher's Helm chart failed because recent Fleet updates introduced new cronjob resources, and when Rancher adopted the latest version of Fleet, the Rancher uninstall process was not updated to include the cleanup of these new resources. See [#51478](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/51478). To resolve this issue in previously affected versions, apply the workaround detailed in this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.scc.suse.com/s/kb/Rancher-Uninstall-via-Helm-release-fails-due-to-post-delete-hook-job-failure?language=en_US).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you're installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-requirements).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher now requires the cluster it runs on to have the [Kubernetes API Aggregation Layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) enabled. This is because Rancher extends Kubernetes with additional APIs by registering its own extension API server. Please note that all versions of Kubernetes supported in this Rancher versions K8s distributions (RKE2/K3s) will have the aggregation layer configured and enabled by default. Refer to the [Extension API Server documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/api/extension-apiserver#aggregation-layer-is-required) and [#50400](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/50400) for more information.\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE/RKE1) has reached end of life as of **July 31, 2025**. Rancher versions 2.12.0 and later no longer support provisioning or managing downstream RKE1 clusters. We recommend replatforming RKE1 clusters to RKE2 to ensure continued support and security updates. Learn more about the transition [here](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021518).\r\n>\r\n> Rancher now has a pre-upgrade validation check for RKE1 resources which fails and lists the RKE1 resources if present. Refer to the [RKE1 Resource Validation and Upgrade Requirements documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker/upgrade-docker-installed-rancher#rke1-resource-validation-and-upgrade-requirements-in-rancher-v212) and [#50286](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/50286) for more information.\r\n\r\n> **Important:** It is crucial that you review the available disk space on your nodes and plan accordingly before upgrading to Rancher v2.12.0 and later to avoid potential disk pressure and pod eviction issues. For additional information refer to the [UI Server Side Pagination - Disk Space documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/ui-server-side-pagination#disk-space).\r\n\r\n> **Important:** Rancher now has an enablement option called [`AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log#viewing-api-audit-logs:~:text=Description-,AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED,-false%20%2D%20Disables%20the) for API Audit Logs for a Rancher installation. In Rancher versions 2.11.x and earlier, only the `AUDIT_LEVEL` could be set and the default log level (`0`) would disable the audit log. In Rancher versions 2.12.x and later, the default log level (`0`) now only contains the log request and response metadata, and can be set when configuring `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`. If installing or upgrading via Helm you can enable the API Audit Logs and specify the log level by applying the following setting to your Helm command: `--set auditLog.enabled=true --set auditLog.level=0`. See the [Enabling the API Audit Log to Record System Events](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log) documentation and [#48941](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/48941).\r\n\r\n## Changes in Image Artifacts\r\n\r\nImage artifact digests are renamed in Rancher v2.12.0, v2.11.4 and v2.10.8. Up until this change, separate image digests files for each operating system and architecture have been maintained for compatibility reasons. With this change, only one file for each operating system is to be provided:\r\n\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-linux-amd64.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-linux-arm64.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-linux.txt`.\r\n- The `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2019.txt` and `rancher-images-digests-windows-ltsc2022.txt` files are to be renamed to `rancher-images-digests-windows.txt`.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** [Create a backup](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.13/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher) before you upgrade Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must first back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to the same state as when the backup was created, any changes post-upgrade will not be included after the restore.\r\n- **Helm version requirements:**\r\n  - To manage Rancher 2.12.x and later, you must upgrade your Helm client to version 3.18 or newer.\r\n  - This change is required to reflect the addition of Kubernetes 1.33 support with this release.\r\n  - Currently, the official [Helm Version Support Policy](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/version_skew/) dictates that only Helm 3.18 supports the proper Kubernetes version range for Rancher 2.12.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and later, disable firewalld as it's incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - When upgrading or installing a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or later, upgrade to RKE v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel v0.13.0. Flannel v0.13.0 supports nf_tables. See Flannel [#1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - When using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher instance, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy/install-rancher) and issue [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n  - When installing Rancher with Docker in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command, as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/private-registry). If the registry has certificates, then you'll also need to supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Requirements for general Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, you must use the `privileged` flag. See [documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container will come up and work as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for the latest and stable Rancher versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/resources/choose-a-rancher-version) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.13.0\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n- CLI - [v2.13.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.13.0)\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Versions for RKE2/K3s\r\n\r\n- v1.34.1 (Default)\r\n- v1.33.5\r\n- v1.32.9\r\n\r\n## Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nIn Rancher v2.6.0 and later, in the **Apps & Marketplace** UI, many Rancher Helm charts are named with a major version that starts with *100*. This avoids simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also complies with semantic versioning (SemVer), which is a requirement for Helm. You can see the upstream version number of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Long-standing Known Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Apply same headers as \"Major Bug Fixes\" but with \"Long-standing Known Issues\" suffix instead -->\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher General\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.12.2:**\r\n  - The [SUSE Customer Center (SCC)](https://scc.suse.com/home) system view has a known issue being investigated regarding duplicate Rancher Manager registrations. See [rancher/scc-operator #38](https://github.com/rancher/scc-operator/issues/38).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Cluster Provisioning\r\n\r\n- Not all cluster tools can be installed on a hardened cluster.<!--no issue number available -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.8.1:**\r\n  - When you  attempt to register a new etcd/controlplane node in a CAPR-managed cluster after a failed etcd snapshot restoration, the node can become stuck in a perpetual paused state, displaying the error message `[ERROR]  000 received while downloading Rancher connection information. Sleeping for 5 seconds and trying again`. As a workaround, you can unpause the cluster by running `kubectl edit clusters.cluster clustername -n fleet-default` and set `spec.unpaused` to `false`.  See [#43735](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/43735).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you upgrade or update any hosted cluster, and go to **Cluster Management > Clusters** while the cluster is still provisioning, the **Registration** tab is visible. Registering a cluster that is already registered with Rancher can cause data corruption. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - RKE2 Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve **Active** status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete. See [#34518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34518) and [#42834](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/42834).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - K3s Provisioning <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.6:**\r\n  - Provisioning RKE2/K3s clusters with added (not built-in) custom node drivers causes provisioning to fail. As a workaround, [fix](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074#issuecomment-1664722305) the added node drivers after activating. See [#37074](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/37074).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - Clusters remain in an `Updating` state even when they contain nodes in an `Error` state. See [#39164](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39164).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher App (Global UI)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.12.1:**\r\n  - When a standard user with the Cluster Owner role attempts to edit an Azure or AKS cluster, the Machine Pools section shows an error `Cannot read properties of undefined...`. As a workaround, standard users must manually add their cloud credentials to create, edit, and manage Azure or AKS clusters. See [#15241](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/15241).\r\n- **Rancher v2.10.0:**\r\n  - After deleting a Namespace or Project in the Rancher UI, the Namespace or Project remains visible. As a workaround, refresh the page. See [#12220](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/12220).\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.2:**\r\n  - Although system mode node pools must have at least one node, the Rancher UI allows a minimum node count of zero. Inputting a zero minimum node count through the UI can cause cluster creation to fail due to an invalid parameter error. To prevent this error from occurring, enter a minimum node count at least equal to the node count. See [#11922](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/11922).\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - When creating a cluster in the Rancher UI it does not allow the use of an underscore `_` in the `Cluster Name` field. See [#9416](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9416).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Hosted Rancher <!-- hostbusters -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.5:**\r\n  - The **Cluster** page shows the **Registration** tab when updating or upgrading a hosted cluster. See [#8524](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/8524).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - EKS\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.0:**\r\n  - EKS clusters on Kubernetes v1.21 or below on Rancher v2.7 cannot be upgraded. See [#39392](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/39392).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Authentication <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.9.0:**\r\n  - There are some known issues with the OpenID Connect provider support:\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, and you attempt to add auth provider users to a cluster or project, users are not populated in the dropdown search bar. This is expected behavior as the OIDC auth provider alone is not searchable. See [#46104](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46104).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled, auth provider users that are added to a cluster/project by their username are not able to access resources upon logging in. A user will only have access to resources upon login if the user is added by their userID.  See [#46105](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46105).\r\n    - When the generic OIDC auth provider is enabled and an auth provider user in a nested group is logged into Rancher, the user will see the following error when they attempt to create a Project: `[projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io](http://projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io/) is forbidden: User \"u-gcxatwsnku\" cannot create resource \"projectroletemplatebindings\" in API group \"[management.cattle.io](http://management.cattle.io/)\" in the namespace \"p-9t5pg\"`. However, the project is still created. See [#46106](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/46106).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Rancher Webhook <!-- neo -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - A webhook is installed in all downstream clusters. There are several issues that users may encounter with this functionality:\r\n    - If you rollback from a version of Rancher v2.7.2 or later, to a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2, the webhooks will remain in downstream clusters. Since the webhook is designed to be 1:1 compatible with specific versions of Rancher, this can cause unexpected behaviors to occur downstream. The Rancher team has developed a [script](https://github.com/rancher/webhook/wiki/Remove-Webhook-from-downstream-clusters) which should be used after rollback is complete (meaning after a Rancher version earlier than v2.7.2 is running). This removes the webhook from affected downstream clusters. See [#40816](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40816).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Virtualization Management (Harvester)\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.2:**\r\n  - If you're using Rancher v2.7.2 with Harvester v1.1.1 clusters, you won't be able to select the Harvester cloud provider when deploying or updating guest clusters. The [Harvester release notes](https://github.com/harvester/release-notes/blob/main/v1.1.2.md#important-information-about-rancher-support) contain instructions on how to resolve this. See [#3750](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3750).\r\n\r\n## Long-standing Known Issues - Backup/Restore <!-- night's watch -->\r\n\r\n- When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.<!-- no issue number -->\r\n\r\n- **Rancher v2.7.7:**\r\n  - Due to the backoff logic in various components, downstream provisioned K3s and RKE2 clusters may take longer to re-achieve **Active** status after a migration. If you see that a downstream cluster is still updating or in an error state immediately after a migration, please let it attempt to resolve itself. This might take up to an hour to complete.

The key highlights are LocalPV LVM snapshot restores . In addition, the release includes various usability and functional fixes for mayastor,  ZFS, LocalPV LVM and LocalPV Hostpath provisioners, along with documentation enhancements to help users and new contributors get started quickly.\r\n\r\n## Replicated Storage (Mayastor)\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- DiskPool Expansion\r\nIt's now possible to expand a DiskPool's capacity by expanding the underlying storage device.\r\n> _**NOTE**_: As a precondition you must create the DiskPool with sufficient metadata to accommodate/support future growth, please read more about this [here](https://openebs.io/docs/main/user-guides/replicated-storage-user-guide/replicated-pv-mayastor/advanced-operations/diskpool-expansion).\r\n- Configurable ClusterSize\r\nYou can now configure the cluster size when creating a pool - larger cluster sizes may be beneficial when using very large storage devices.\r\n>_**NOTE**_: As an initial limitation volumes may not be placed across pools with different cluster sizes\r\n- Pool Cordon\r\nExtend cordoning functionality to pools. This can be used to prevent new replicas from being created on a pool, and also as a way of migrating a volume replica out of it via scale-up/scale-down operations. \r\n- Orphaned Retain Snapshot Delete\r\nSimilar to volumes, when with snapshots retain move are deleted, the underlying storage is kept by the provisioner and must be deleted with provisioner specific commands.\r\nWe've added a plugin sub-command to delete these orphaned snapshots safely.\r\n- Node Spread\r\nNode spread topology may now be used\r\n- Affinity Group ScaleDown\r\nAffinity group volumes may now be scaled down to 1 replica, provided the anti-affinity across nodes is not violated.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n\r\n- Update replica health as an atomic etcd transaction\r\n- Exit io-engine with error if the gRPC port is busy\r\n- Set PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER for io-engine to resolve potential deadlock\r\n- Don't let 1 bad nexus lockup the entire nexus subsystem\r\n- Clean up uuid from DISKS output uri\r\n- Honor stsAffinity on backup restores via external tools\r\n- Validate K8s secret in diskpool operator ahead of pool creation request\r\n- Allow pool creation with zfs volume paths\r\n- Added support for kubeconfig context switching (kubectl-mayastor plugin)\r\n- Fixed creating pools on very-slow/very-large storage devices\r\n- Use udev kernel monitor\r\n- Fixed race condition where udev events were lost leading to connecting nvme devices\r\n- Fixed HA enablement on the latest rhel and derivatives\r\n- Fixed open permissions on call-home encryption dir\r\n- Configurable ports of services with hostNetwork\r\n- Add support for 1GiB hugepages\r\n- etcd dependency updated to `12.0.14`\r\n- Use normalized etcdUrl in default etcd-probe init containers \r\n- Use correct grpc port in metrics exporter\r\n- Fix volume mkfs stuck on very large pools/volumes\r\n- Fix agent-core panic when scheduling replicas\r\n- Add default priority class to the daemon sets\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [Mayastor v2.10.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor/releases/tag/v2.10.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n   - The Mayastor IO engine fully utilizes allocated CPU cores regardless of I/O load, running a poller at full speed.\r\n   - A Mayastor DiskPool is limited to a single block device and cannot span multiple block devices.\r\n   - The new at-rest encryption feature does not support rotating Data Encryption Keys(DEK).\r\n   - Volume rebuilds are only performed on published volumes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- **IO-Engine Pod Restarts**  \r\n   - Under heavy I/O and during constant scaling up/down of volume replicas, the io-engine pod may restart occasionally.\r\n- **fsfreeze Operation Failure**  \r\n   - If a pod-based workload is scheduled on a node that reboots and the pod lacks a controller (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet),  the volume unpublish operation might not be triggered. \r\n   - This leads the control plane to assume the volume is still published, causing the fsfreeze operation to fail during snapshot creation.\r\n        - **Workaround** Recreate or reinstate the pod to ensure proper volume mounting.\r\n- **Diskpool's backing device failure**\r\n   - If the backend device that hosts a diskpool runs into a fault, or gets removed e.g cloud disk removal, the status of diskpool and hosted replicas isn't clearly updated to reflect the problem. \r\n   - As a result the resultant failures aren't gracefully handled and volume might remain Degraded for an extended period of time.\r\n- **Extremely large pool undergoing dirty shutdown**\r\n   - In case of a dirty shutdown of io-engine node hosting an extremely large pool e.g 10TiB or 20TiB.\r\n   - The recovery of pool takes a while after the node comes online.\r\n\r\n## LocalPV ZFS\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n- Update Go runtime to 1.24.\r\n  Bumps up go runtime and all dependents to their latest available releases \r\n- Allow users to configure CPU and memory requests/limits for all zfs-node and zfs-controller containers via values.yaml, improving resource management and deployment flexibility\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\r\n- Removes encryption parameter handling from `buildCloneCreateArgs()` since clones automatically inherit encryption from the parent snapshot and the property cannot be set (it's read-only) \r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration and Maintenance\r\n- Staging CI \r\n   Introduction of the staging CI, which enables creating a staging build for e2e testing before releasing, the artifacts are then copied over to production build hosts.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [ZFS v2.9.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/releases/tag/v2.9.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## LocalPV LVM\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Snapshot restore\r\n   LocalPV-LVM snapshot had limited capabilities. Now we support restoring a snapshot to volume \r\n- ThinPool space reclamation\r\n   LocalPV-LVM will cleanup the thinpool LV after deleting the last thin volume of the thinpool \r\n- Scheduler fixes and enhancements\r\n    Record thinpool statistics in lvmnode CR. Fail fast CreateVolume request if thick PVC size cannot be accommodated by any VG.\r\n    Considers thinpool free space while scheduling thin pvc in SpaceWeighted algorithm \r\n- Runtime improvements\r\n   Updates Go runtime, k8s modules, golint packages etc by @jochenseeber in https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/416\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration and Maintenance\r\n-  Staging CI\r\n    Introduction of the staging CI, which enables creating a staging build for e2e testing before releasing, the artifacts are then copied over to production build hosts.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [LVM v1.8.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/releases/tag/v1.8.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- There's no unmap/reclaim for thin pool capacity.\r\n  It is not tracked in the `lvmnode`, which may lead to unexpected behaviour when scheduling volumes.  \r\n  Read more about this [here](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/issues/382)\r\n\r\n## LocalPV Hostpath\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n   - Refer to the [Hostpath v4.4.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner/releases/tag/v4.4.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## LocalPV RawFile\r\n\r\n### New Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n- VolumeSnapshots based on the rawfile image\r\n- Volume Restore from snapshot\r\n- Volume Clone\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\nMake sure you follow the [install guide](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv/blob/v0.11.0/docs/install-guide.md#upgrade) when upgrading.  \r\nRefer to the [Rawfile v0.12.0 release](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv/releases/tag/v0.12.0) for detailed changes.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- **Controller Pod Restart on Single Node Setup**  \r\n   After upgrading, single node setups may face issues where the ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv controller pod does not enter the Running state due to changes in the controller manifest (now a Deployment) and missing affinity rules.\r\n \r\n  _Workaround:_ Delete the old controller pod to allow the new pod to be scheduled correctly. This does not happen if upgrading from the previous release of ZFS-localpv/LVM-localpv.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n   - Kubernetes Requirement: Kubernetes 1.23 or higher is recommended.\r\n   - Engine Compatibility: Upgrades to OpenEBS 4.4.0 are supported only for the following engines:\r\n     - Local PV Hostpath\r\n     - Local PV LVM\r\n     - Local PV ZFS\r\n     - Mayastor (from earlier editions, 3.10.x or below)\r\n     - Local PV Rawfile\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2025-11-21T14:06:09Z", "project": "OpenEBS", "repo": "openebs/openebs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3007.9", "tag_name": "v3007.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases/tag/v3007.9", "repo_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt", "body": "", "created_at": "2025-11-20T17:57:24Z", "project": "SaltStack", "repo": "saltstack/salt", "type": "Automation", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v4.10.13-lts", "tag_name": "v4.10.13", "html_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/tag/v4.10.13", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver", "body": "## What\u2019s new\r\n- Brand-new JumpServer client with smaller footprint and improved user experience ([v4.0.0](https://github.com/jumpserver/client/releases/v4.0.0)).\r\n- Supports video transcoding, allowing conversion of recordings generated by Lion and Razor (video-worker).

the [2.12 Upgrade Guide](https://docs.nats.io/release-notes/whats_new/whats_new_212) for backwards compatibility notes with 2.11.x.\r\n\r\n### Go Version\r\n\r\n- 1.25.4 (#7520)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- github.com/klauspost/compress v1.18.1 (#7474)\r\n- github.com/nats-io/nats.go v1.47.0 (#7474)\r\n- golang.org/x/sys v0.38.0 (#7538)\r\n- github.com/minio/highwayhash 070ab1a (#7539)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- Support for the PROXY protocol (v1 and v2) for client connections, when `proxy_protocol: true` is set in the config (#7456)\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- Added `meta_compact` and `meta_compact_size`, advanced JetStream config options to control how many log entries must be present in the metalayer log before snapshotting and compaction takes place (#7484, #7521)\r\n- Added `write_timeout` option for clients, routes, gateways and leafnodes which controls the behaviour on reaching the `write_deadline`, values can be `default`, `retry` or `close` (#7513)\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\n\r\n- Added expvar `/debug/vars` endpoint to the monitoring port (#7469)\r\n- Meta cluster snapshot statistics have been added to the `/jsz` endpoint (#7524)\r\n- The `/jsz` endpoint can now show direct consumers with the `direct-consumers?true` flag (#7543)\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- Binary stream snapshots are now preferred by default for nodes on new route connections (#7479)\r\n- Reduced allocations in the sublist and subject transforms (#7519)\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- Improved the logging for observer mode (#7433)\r\n- Improve interest detection when consumers are created or deleted across different servers (#7440)\r\n- Improved the performance of enforcing `max_bytes` and `max_msgs` limits (#7455)\r\n- Streams and consumers will no longer unnecessarily snapshot when being removed or scaling down (#7495)\r\n- Streams are now loaded in parallel when enabling JetStream, often reducing the time it takes to start up the server (#7482, #7526)\r\n- Log lines and errors related to offline/unsupported assets are now clearer (#7416, #7425)\r\n- Stream catchups will now use delete ranges more aggressively, speeding up catchups of large streams with many interior deletes (#7512)\r\n- Streams with subject transforms can now implicitly republish based on those transforms by configuring `>` for both republish source and destination (#7515)\r\n- A race condition where subscriptions may not be set up before catchup requests are sent after a leader change has been fixed (#7518)\r\n- Reduced heap allocations in hash checks (#7539)\r\n- Healthchecks now correctly report when streams are catching up, instead of showing them as unhealthy (#7535)\r\n- Potentially reduced the number of calls to the account resolver for assets that are not resident on that server (#7537)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- When using message tracing, header corruption when setting the hop header has been fixed (#7443)\r\n- Fixed a bug when validating leafnode proxies (#7444)\r\n- Fixed a regression where token authentication would not be parsed correctly in leafnode URLs (#7452)\r\n- Gateway subscribe/unsubscribe will no longer block on account fetches (#7449) \r\n- Shutting down a server using lame-duck mode should no longer result in max connection exceeded errors (#7527)\r\n\r\nJetStream\r\n\r\n- Caches will now no longer expire unnecessarily when re-reading the same sequences multiple times in first-matching code paths (#7435)\r\n- Fixed a bug in atomic batching where the incorrect field would be checked when looking for unsupported headers (#7436)\r\n- Fixed a deadlock that could happen when interleaving a direct get request with a batch write (#7458)\r\n- A couple of issues related to header handling have been fixed (#7465)\r\n- No-wait requests now return a 400 No Messages response correctly if the stream is empty (#7466)\r\n- Raft groups will now only report leadership status after a no-op entry on recovery (#7460)\r\n- Fixed a race condition in the filestore that could happen between storing messages and shutting down (#7496)\r\n- A panic that could occur when recovering streams in parallel has been fixed (#7503)\r\n- An off-by-one when detecting holes at the end of a filestore block has been fixed (#7508)\r\n- Indexing a message block in the filestore no longer tries to adjust the cache first sequence (#7508)\r\n- Writing skip message records in the filestore no longer releases and reacquires the lock unnecessarily (#7508)\r\n- Writing message records only overwrites the cache first sequence on the first indexed write (#7508)\r\n- Fixed a bug on metalayer recovery where stream and consumer monitor goroutines for recreated assets would run with the wrong Raft group (#7510)\r\n- Scaling up an asset from R1 now results in an installed snapshot, allowing recovery after restart if interrupted, avoiding a potential desync (#7509)\r\n- Raft groups should no longer report no quorum incorrectly when shutting down (#7522)\r\n- Consumers that existed in a metalayer snapshot but were deleted on recovery will no longer result in failing healthchecks (#7523)\r\n- An off-by-one when detecting holes at the end of a filestore block has been fixed (#7525)\r\n- Fixed a race condition that could happen with shutdown signals when shutting down JetStream (#7536)\r\n- Fixed an issue in the filestore where skipping message sequences did not correctly update the cache accounting (#7534)\r\n- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when purging a stream with mismatched consumer state (#7546)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n \r\nhttps://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/compare/v2.12.1...v2.12.2", "created_at": "2025-11-13T13:13:54Z", "project": "NATS", "repo":

Regression:\r\n>   - [\\[BUG\\] invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12233) that can trigger a nil-pointer dereference under certain conditions, potentially causing unexpected crashes.\r\n>   - [\\[BUG\\] Block Mode Volume Migration Stuck](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12311) that can cause block mode volume migration to get stuck indefinitely.\r\n> - Day-one issues:\r\n>   - V2 volume clone:\r\n>     - [\\[BUG\\] V2 Volume CSI Clone Slowness Caused by VolumeAttachment Webhook](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12328) that can lead to significant delays during V2 volume cloning operations.\r\n>     - [\\[BUG\\] [Bug] A cloned volume cannot be attached to a workload](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12206) that prevents cloned volumes from being attached to workloads.\r\n>   - Replica auto-balance:\r\n>     - [\\[BUG\\] Replica auto balance disk pressure threshold stalled with stopped volumes](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/10837) that can cause the replica auto-balance feature to stall when volumes are stopped under disk pressure conditions.\r\n> \r\n> To mitigate the issues, replace `longhorn-manager:v1.10.1` with the hotfixed image `longhorn-manager:v1.10.1-hotfix-2`.\r\n> \r\n> Follow these steps to apply the update:\r\n> \r\n> 1. **Disable the upgrade version check**\r\n>    - Helm users: Set `upgradeVersionCheck` to `false` in the `values.yaml` file.\r\n>    - Manifest users: Remove the `--upgrade-version-check` flag from the deployment manifest.\r\n> \r\n> 2. **Update the `longhorn-manager` image**\r\n>    - Change the image tag from `v1.10.1` to `v1.10.1-hotfix-2` in the appropriate file:\r\n>      - For Helm: Update `values.yaml`\r\n>      - For manifests: Update the deployment manifest directly.\r\n> \r\n> 3. **Proceed with the upgrade**\r\n>    - Apply the changes using your standard Helm upgrade command or reapply the updated manifest.\r\n>\r\n> ### Upgrade\r\n> \r\n> If your Longhorn cluster was initially deployed with a version earlier than v1.3.0, the Custom Resources (CRs) were created using the `v1beta1` APIs. While the upgrade from Longhorn v1.8 to v1.9 automatically migrates all CRs to the new `v1beta2` version, **a manual CR migration is strongly advised before upgrading from Longhorn `v1.9` to `v1.10`**.\r\n> \r\n> Certain operations, such as an `etcd` or CRD restore, may leave behind `v1beta1` data. Manually migrating your CRs ensures that all Longhorn data is properly updated to the `v1beta2` API, preventing potential compatibility issues and unexpected behavior with the new Longhorn version.\r\n> \r\n> Following the manual migration, **verify that `v1beta1` has been removed from the CRD stored versions** to ensure completion and a successful upgrade.\r\n>\r\n> For more details, see [Kubernetes official document for CRD storage version](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#upgrade-existing-objects-to-a-new-stored-version), and [Issue #11886](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11886).\r\n> \r\n> #### Migration Requirement Before Longhorn v1.10 Upgrade\r\n> \r\n> Before upgrading from Longhorn v1.9 to v1.10, perform the following manual CRD storage version migration.\r\n> \r\n> > **Note**: If your Longhorn installation uses a namespace other than `longhorn-system`, replace `longhorn-system` with your custom namespace throughout the commands.\r\n> \r\n> ```bash\r\n> # Temporarily disable the CR validation webhook to allow updating read-only settings CRs.\r\n> kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator \\\r\n>   --type=merge \\\r\n>   -p \"$(kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator -o json | \\\r\n>   jq '.webhooks[0].rules |= map(if .apiGroups == [\"longhorn.io\"] and .resources == [\"settings\"] then\r\n>     .operations |= map(select(. != \"UPDATE\")) else . end)')\"\r\n>\r\n> # Migrate CRDs that ever stored v1beta1 resources\r\n> migration_time=\"$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)\"\r\n> crds=($(kubectl get crd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=longhorn -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status.storedVersions | index(\"v1beta1\")) | .metadata.name'))\r\n> for crd in \"${crds[@]}\"; do\r\n>   echo \"Migrating ${crd} ...\"\r\n>   for name in $(kubectl -n longhorn-system get \"$crd\" -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do\r\n>     # Attach additional annotations to trigger v1beta1 resource updating in the latest storage version.\r\n>     kubectl patch \"${crd}\" \"${name}\" -n longhorn-system --type=merge -p='{\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"migration-time\":\"'\"${migration_time}\"'\"}}}'\r\n>  done\r\n>  # Clean up the stored version in CRD status\r\n>  kubectl patch crd \"${crd}\" --type=merge -p '{\"status\":{\"storedVersions\":[\"v1beta2\"]}}' --subresource=status\r\n> done\r\n> \r\n> # Re-enable the CR validation webhook.\r\n> kubectl patch validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator \\\r\n>   --type=merge \\\r\n>   -p \"$(kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration longhorn-webhook-validator -o json | \\\r\n>   jq '.webhooks[0].rules |= map(if .apiGroups == [\"longhorn.io\"] and .resources == [\"settings\"] then\r\n>     .operations |= (. + [\"UPDATE\"] | unique) else . end)')\"\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> #### Migration Verification\r\n> \r\n> After running the script, verify the CRD stored versions using this command:\r\n> \r\n> ```bash\r\n> kubectl get crd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=longhorn -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{\": \"}{.status.storedVersions}{\"\\n\"}{end}'\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Crucially, all Longhorn CRDs MUST have only `\"v1beta2\"` listed in `storedVersions` (i.e., `\"v1beta1\"` must be completely absent) before proceeding to the v1.10 upgrade.\r\n> \r\n> Example of successful output:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> backingimagedatasources.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backingimagemanagers.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backingimages.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backupbackingimages.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backups.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backuptargets.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> backupvolumes.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> engineimages.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> engines.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> instancemanagers.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> nodes.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> orphans.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> recurringjobs.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> replicas.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> settings.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> sharemanagers.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> snapshots.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> supportbundles.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> systembackups.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> systemrestores.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> volumeattachments.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> volumes.longhorn.io: [\"v1beta2\"]\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> With these steps completed, the Longhorn upgrade to v1.10 should now proceed without issues.\r\n> \r\n> #### Troubleshooting CRD Upgrade Failures During Upgrade to Longhorn v1.10\r\n> \r\n> If you did not apply the required pre-upgrade migration steps and the CRs are not fully migrated to `v1beta2`, the `longhorn-manager` Pods may fail to operate correctly. A common error message for this issue is:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Upgrade failed: cannot patch \"backingimagedatasources.longhorn.io\" with kind CustomResourceDefinition: CustomResourceDefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io \"backingimagedatasources.longhorn.io\" is invalid: status.storedVersions[0]: Invalid value: \"v1beta1\": missing from spec.versions; v1beta1 was previously a storage version, and must remain in spec.versions until a storage migration ensures no data remains persisted in v1beta1 and removes v1beta1 from status.storedVersions\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> To fix this issue, you must perform a **forced downgrade** back to the **exact Longhorn v1.9.x version** that was running before the failed upgrade attempt.\r\n> \r\n> ##### Downgrade Procedure (kubectl Installation)\r\n> \r\n> If Longhorn was installed using `kubectl`, you must patch the `current-longhorn-version` setting before downgrading. Replace `v1.9.x` with the original version before upgrade in the following commands.\r\n> \r\n> ```bash\r\n> # Attaching annotation to allow patching current-longhorn-version.\r\n> kubectl patch settings.longhorn.io current-longhorn-version -n longhorn-system --type=merge -p='{\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{\"longhorn.io/update-setting-from-longhorn\":\"\"}}}'\r\n> # Temporarily override current version to allow old version installation\r\n> # Replace the value `\"v1.9.x\" to the original version before upgrade.\r\n> kubectl patch settings.longhorn.io current-longhorn-version -n longhorn-system --type=merge -p='{\"value\":\"v1.9.x\"}'\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> After modifying `current-longhorn-version`, you can proceed to downgrade to the original Longhorn v1.9.x deployment.\r\n> \r\n> ##### Downgrade Procedure (Helm Installation)\r\n> \r\n> If Longhorn was installed using Helm, the downgrade is allowed by disabling the [`preUpgradeChecker.upgradeVersionCheck`](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/tree/v1.9.x/chart#other-settings) flag.\r\n> \r\n> ##### Post-Downgrade\r\n> \r\n> Once the downgrade is complete and the Longhorn system is stable on the v1.9.x version, you must immediately follow the steps outlined in the **Migration Requirement Before Longhorn v1.10 Upgrade**. This step is crucial to migrate all remaining `v1beta1` CRs to `v1beta2` before attempting the Longhorn v1.10 upgrade again.\r\n\r\n## Important Fixes\r\n\r\nThis release includes several critical stability and performance improvements:\r\n\r\n### Goroutine Leak in Instance Manager (V2 Data Engine)\r\n\r\nFixed a goroutine leak in the instance manager when using the V2 data engine. This issue could lead to increased memory usage and potential stability problems over time.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #11962](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11962).\r\n\r\n### V2 Volume Attachment Failure in Interrupt Mode\r\n\r\nFixed an issue where V2 volumes using interrupt mode with NVMe disks could fail to complete the attachment process, causing volumes to remain stuck in the attaching state indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn Longhorn v1.10.0, interrupt mode supports only **AIO disks**. Interrupt mode for **NVMe disks** is supported starting in v1.10.1.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #11816](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11816).\r\n\r\n### UI Deployment Failure on IPv4-Only Nodes\r\n\r\nFixed a bug introduced in v1.10.0 where the Longhorn UI failed to deploy on nodes with only IPv4 enabled. The UI now correctly supports IPv4-only configurations without requiring IPv6.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #11875](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/11875).\r\n\r\n### Share Manager Excessive Memory Usage\r\n\r\nFixed excessive memory consumption in the share manager for RWX (ReadWriteMany) volumes. The component now maintains stable memory usage under normal operation.\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Issue #12043](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/12043).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before installing Longhorn v1.10.1.**\r\n\r\nYou can install Longhorn using a variety of tools, including Rancher, Kubectl, and Helm. For more information about installation methods and requirements, see [Quick Installation](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.10.0/deploy/install/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade\r\n\r\n>  [!IMPORTANT]\r\n**Ensure that your cluster is running Kubernetes v1.25 or later before upgrading from Longhorn v1.9.x to v1.10.1.**\r\n\r\nLonghorn only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrade](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.10.0/deploy/upgrade/) in the Longhorn documentation.\r\n\r\n## Post-Release Known Issues\r\n\r\nFor information about issues identified after this release, see [Release-Known-Issues](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Release-Known-Issues).\r\n\r\n## Resolved Issues\r\n\r\n### Improvement\r\n\r\n- [BACKPORT][v1.10.1][IMPROVEMENT] The `auto-delete-pod-when-volume-detached-unexpectedly` should only focus on the kubernetes builtin workload.

This is the second time-based released for containerd.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Add mount manager** ([#12063](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12063))\n\n  The mount manager is a new service that provides lifecycle management for filesystem mounts\n  to support more advanced use cases, such as:\n  * **Device formatting** to create formatted filesystems (xfs, ext4) on-demand\n  * **Mount activation** to prepare devices such as loopbacks or network fileystems\n  * **Mount transformation** to allow mount arguments to be filled in dynamically from previous mounts\n  * **Garbage collection** of mounts to ensure temporary mounts are never leaked\n* **Add conf.d include in the default config** ([#12323](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12323))\n* **Add support for back references in the garbage collector** ([#12025](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12025))\n\n#### Container Runtime Interface (CRI)\n\n* **Pod Sandbox Metrics** ([#10691](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/10691))\n\n  Full implementation of Kubernetes CRI pod-level metrics API\n  * **ListPodSandboxMetrics**: Query metrics for  running pods/sandboxes\n  * **ListMetricsDescriptors**: Discover available metrics and their descriptions\n* **Support image volume mount subpath** ([#11578](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11578))\n\n#### Go client\n\n* **Update pkg/oci to use fs.FS interface and os.OpenRoot** ([#12245](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12245))\n\n#### Image Distribution\n\n* **Parallel Unpack**  ([#12332](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12332))\n\n  Adds support for unpacking layers in parallel during pull operations. This feature is supported with overlayfs and EROFS snapshotters.\n* **OCI Referrers Support** ([#12309](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12309))\n\n  Adds new referrers fetcher to remote registry interface using the [new referrers endpoint added in OCI distribution-spec 1.1](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md#listing-referrers)\n* **Tar unpack progress through transfer service** ([#11921](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11921))\n\n#### Image Storage\n\n* **EROFS enhancements using mount manager** ([#12333](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12333))\n\n  Improvements to EROFS snapshotter using the new mount manager service\n  * **Quota Support**: Support for sized block devices as the upper layer for overlayfs\n  * **Mount Lifecycle**: Loopback setup, block device creation, and overlayfs argument formatting is moved to the\n     mount  manager to be performed on-demand or within the runtime.\n  * **Mount handler**: To allow optimization of EROFS mount types based on the current system\n  * **macOS Support**: EROFS snapshotter can now be used on Darwin to natively allow image pulls\n  * **Tar index mode**: Efficiently generate EROFS metadata backed by original tar content ([#11919](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11919))\n* **Add snapshotter and differ for block CIMs** ([#12050](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12050))\n\n#### Node Resource Interface (NRI)\n\n* **Enable otel traces in NRI** ([#12082](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12082))\n* **Add WASM plugin support** ([containerd/nri#121](https://github.com/containerd/nri/pull/121))\n\n#### Runtime\n\n* **Improve shim load time after restart by loading in parallel** ([#12142](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12142))\n* **Fix pidfd leak in UnshareAfterEnterUserns** ([#12167](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12167))\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n* **Deprecate cgroup v1** ([#12445](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12445))\n* **Postpone v2.2 deprecation items to v2.3** ([#12417](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/12417))\n\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues

These metrics were deprecated in v22.0.0:\n\n| Metric Name               | Component | Deprecated In |\n|---------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| `QueriesProcessed`        | vtgate    | v22.0.0       |\n| `QueriesRouted`           | vtgate    | v22.0.0       |\n| `QueriesProcessedByTable` | vtgate    | v22.0.0       |\n| `QueriesRoutedByTable`    | vtgate    | v22.0.0       |\n\n**Impact**: Any monitoring dashboards or alerting systems using these metrics must be updated to use the replacement metrics introduced in v22.0.0:\n- Use `QueryExecutions` instead of `QueriesProcessed`\n- Use `QueryRoutes` instead of `QueriesRouted`\n- Use `QueryExecutionsByTable` instead of `QueriesProcessedByTable` and `QueriesRoutedByTable`\n\nSee the [v22.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/22.0/22.0.0/release_notes.md#new-vtgate-metrics) for details on the new metrics.\n\n#### <a id=\"executefetchasdba-multistatement\"/>ExecuteFetchAsDba No Longer Accepts Multi-Statement SQL</a>\n\nThe `ExecuteFetchAsDba` RPC method in TabletManager now explicitly rejects SQL queries containing multiple statements (as of [PR #18183](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18183)).\n\n**Impact**: Code or automation that previously passed multiple semicolon-separated SQL statements to `ExecuteFetchAsDba` will now receive an error. Each SQL statement must be sent in a separate RPC call.\n\n**Migration**: Split multi-statement SQL into individual RPC calls:\n\n```go\n// Before (no longer works):\nExecuteFetchAsDba(\"CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT); CREATE TABLE t2 (id INT);\")\n\n// After (required in v23+):\nExecuteFetchAsDba(\"CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);\")\nExecuteFetchAsDba(\"CREATE TABLE t2 (id INT);\")\n```\n\n#### <a id=\"grpc-error-codes\"/>gRPC TabletManager Error Code Changes</a>\n\nThe `vttablet` gRPC `tabletmanager` client now returns errors wrapped by the internal `go/vt/vterrors` package ([PR #18565](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18565)).\n\n**Impact**: External automation relying on google-gRPC error codes must be updated to use `vterrors.Code(err)` to inspect error codes, which returns `vtrpcpb.Code`s defined in [proto/vtrpc.proto](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/vtrpc.proto#L60).\n\n**Migration**:\n```go\n// Before:\nif status.Code(err) == codes.NotFound { ... }\n\n// After:\nif vterrors.Code(err) == vtrpcpb.Code_NOT_FOUND { ... }\n```\n\n#### <a id=\"gtid-api-changes\"/>GTID API Signature Changes</a>\n\nSeveral GTID-related API signatures changed in [PR #18196](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18196) as part of GTID performance optimizations:\n\n**Changed**: `BinlogEvent.GTID()` method signature\n**Impact**: Code directly using the GTID parsing APIs may need updates. Most users are unaffected as these are internal APIs.\n\n#### <a id=\"generateshardranges-api\"/>GenerateShardRanges API Signature Change</a>\n\nThe `key.GenerateShardRanges()` function signature changed in [PR #18633](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18633) to add a new `hexChars int` parameter controlling the hex width of generated shard names.\n\n**Impact**: Code calling `GenerateShardRanges()` directly must be updated to pass the new parameter.\n\nThe corresponding vtctldclient command gained a new `--chars` flag to control this behavior.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"flag-naming-convention-migration\"/>Flag Naming Convention Migration</a>\n\nVitess v23.0.0 includes a major standardization of CLI flag naming conventions across all binaries. **989 flags** have been migrated from underscore notation (`flag_name`) to dash notation (`flag-name`) in [PR #18280](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18280) and related PRs.\n\n#### Backward Compatibility\n\n- **v23.0.0 and v24.0.0**: Both underscore and dash formats are supported. Underscore format is **deprecated** but functional.\n- **v25.0.0**: Underscore format will be **removed**. Only dash format will be accepted.\n\n#### Automatic Normalization\n\nFlag normalization happens automatically at the `pflag` level ([PR #18642](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18642)), so both formats are accepted without requiring code changes in v23/v24.\n\n#### Example Flag Renames\n\nCommon flags affected (full list of 989 flags available in PR #18280):\n\n**Backup flags**:\n- `--azblob_backup_account_name` \u2192 `--azblob-backup-account-name`\n- `--s3_backup_storage_bucket` \u2192 `--s3-backup-storage-bucket`\n- `--xtrabackup_root_path` \u2192 `--xtrabackup-root-path`\n\n**Replication flags**:\n- `--heartbeat_enable` \u2192 `--heartbeat-enable`\n- `--replication_connect_retry` \u2192 `--replication-connect-retry`\n\n**gRPC flags** ([PR #18009](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18009)):\n- All gRPC-related flags standardized (30+ flags)\n\n#### Action Required\n\nUsers should update configuration files, scripts, and automation to use dash-based flag names before upgrading to v25.0.0. The migration is backward compatible in v23 and v24, allowing gradual updates.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"new-default-versions\"/>New default versions</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"upgrade-to-mysql-8-4\"/>Upgrade to MySQL 8.4</a>\n\nThe default major MySQL version used by our `vitess/lite:latest` image is going from `8.0.40` to `8.4.6`.\nThis change was merged in [#18569](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18569).\n\nVTGate also advertises MySQL version `8.4.6` by default instead of `8.0.40`. If that is not what you are running, you can set the `mysql_server_version` flag to advertise the desired version.\n\n>  \u26a0\ufe0f Upgrading to this release with vitess-operator:\n>\n> If you are using the `vitess-operator`, considering that we are bumping the MySQL version from `8.0.40` to `8.4.6`, you will have to manually upgrade:\n>\n> 1. Add `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` to your extra cnf in your YAML file.\n> 2. Apply this file.\n> 3. Wait for all the pods to be healthy.\n> 4. Then change your YAML file to use the new Docker Images (`vitess/lite:v23.0.0`).\n> 5. Remove `innodb_fast_shutdown=0` from your extra cnf in your YAML file.\n> 6. Apply this file.\n>\n> This is only needed once when going from the latest `8.0.x` to `8.4.x`. Once you're on `8.4.x`, it is possible to upgrade and downgrade between `8.4.x` versions without needing to run `innodb_fast_shutdown=0`.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"new-support\"/>New Support</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"multi-query-execution\"/>Multi-Query Execution</a>\n\nVitess v23.0.0 introduces native support for executing multiple queries in a single RPC call through new `ExecuteMulti` and `StreamExecuteMulti` APIs ([PR #18059](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18059)).\n\nThis feature provides more efficient batch query execution without requiring manual query splitting or multiple round trips.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n```go\nqueries := []string{\n    \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1\",\n    \"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1\",\n    \"SELECT * FROM payments WHERE user_id = 1\",\n}\nresults, err := vtgateConn.ExecuteMulti(ctx, queries)\n```\n\n**Configuration**: Enable with the `--mysql-server-multi-query-protocol` flag on VTGate.\n\n#### <a id=\"transaction-timeout-session-variable\"/>Transaction Timeout Session Variable</a>\n\nA new `transaction_timeout` session variable has been added ([PR #18560](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18560)), allowing per-session control over transaction timeout duration.\n\n**Usage**:\n```sql\n-- Set transaction timeout to 30 seconds for this session\nSET transaction_timeout = 30;\n\n-- Begin a transaction that will automatically rollback if not committed within 30s\nBEGIN;\n-- ... perform operations ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\nThis provides more granular timeout control compared to global server settings, useful for:\n- Long-running batch operations that need extended timeouts\n- Interactive sessions that should fail fast\n- Different timeout requirements per application workload\n\n#### <a id=\"query-throttler\"/>Experimental: Query Throttler</a>\n\nVitess v23.0.0 introduces a new, experimental Query Throttler framework for rate-limiting incoming queries ([RFC issue #18412](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/18412), [PR #18449](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18449), [PR #18657](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18657)). Work on this new throttler is ongoing with the potential for breaking changes in the future.\n\nFeedback on this experimental feature is appreciated in GitHub issues or the `#feat-handling-overload` channel of the [Vitess Community Slack](https://vitess.io/slack).\n\n**Features**:\n- File-based configuration for throttling rules\n- Dry-run mode for testing throttling without enforcement\n- Dynamic rule reloading\n\n**Configuration**:\n- `--query-throttler-config-refresh-interval` - How often to reload throttler configuration\n\n**Dry-run Mode**: Test throttling rules without actually blocking queries, useful for validating configuration before enforcement.\n\n#### <a id=\"multiple-lookup-vindexes-support\"/>Multiple Lookup Vindexes Support</a>\n\nCreating multiple lookup vindexes in a single workflow is now supported through the `--params-file` flag ([PR #17566](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17566)).\n\n**Usage**:\n```bash\n# Create multiple lookup vindexes from JSON configuration\nvtctldclient LookupVindexCreate \\\n  --workflow my_lookup_workflow \\\n  --params-file /path/to/params.json \\\n  commerce\n```\n\n**params.json example**:\n```json\n{\n  \"vindexes\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"user_email_lookup\",\n      \"type\": \"consistent_lookup_unique\",\n      \"table_owner\": \"users\",\n      \"table_owner_columns\": [\"email\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"user_name_lookup\",\n      \"type\": \"consistent_lookup\",\n      \"table_owner\": \"users\",\n      \"table_owner_columns\": [\"name\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis significantly improves workflow efficiency when setting up multiple vindexes, reducing the number of separate operations required.\n\n#### <a id=\"reference-tables-in-materialize-workflows\"/>Reference Tables in Materialize Workflows</a>\n\nReference tables can now be added to existing materialize workflows using the new `Materialize ... update` sub-command ([PR #17804](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17804)).\n\n**Usage**:\n```bash\n# Add reference tables to an existing workflow\nvtctldclient Materialize --workflow my_workflow update \\\n  --add-reference-tables ref_table1,ref_table2 \\\n  --target-keyspace my_keyspace\n```\n\n**Use Case**: Incrementally add reference tables to running materialize workflows without recreating the entire workflow, improving operational flexibility.\n\n#### <a id=\"online-ddl-shard-specific-completion\"/>Online DDL Shard-Specific Completion</a>\n\nOnline DDL migrations can now be completed on a per-shard basis using the new `COMPLETE VITESS_SHARDS` syntax ([PR #18331](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18331)).\n\n**Usage**:\n```sql\n-- Complete migration on specific shards only\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3'\n  COMPLETE VITESS_SHARDS '-80,80-';\n\n-- Complete migration on all remaining shards\nALTER VITESS_MIGRATION '9e8a9249_3976_11ed_9442_0a43f95f28a3'\n  COMPLETE;\n```\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Gradual rollout of schema changes across shards\n- Ability to validate changes on subset of shards before full rollout\n- Better control over migration timing and impact\n\n#### <a id=\"with-recursive-ctes\"/>WITH RECURSIVE CTEs</a>\n\nVitess now supports `WITH RECURSIVE` common table expressions ([PR #18590](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18590)), enabling recursive queries for hierarchical data.\n\n**Example**:\n```sql\n-- Find all employees in a management hierarchy\nWITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (\n    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level\n    FROM employees\n    WHERE manager_id IS NULL\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1\n    FROM employees e\n    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id\n)\nSELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY level, name;\n```\n\nThis is a major SQL compatibility enhancement for applications with hierarchical or graph-like data structures.\n\n#### <a id=\"create-table-select-support\"/>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Support</a>\n\nThe SQL parser now supports `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` statements ([PR #18443](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18443)), improving MySQL compatibility.\n\n**Example**:\n```sql\n-- Create a table from a query result\nCREATE TABLE recent_orders\nSELECT * FROM orders\nWHERE order_date > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\n```\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"deprecations\"/>Deprecations</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-metrics\"/>Metrics</a>\n\n| Component |        Metric Name        | Notes                                  |                     Deprecation PR                      |\n|:---------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|\n| `vtorc`   | `DiscoverInstanceTimings` | Replaced by `DiscoveryInstanceTimings` | [#18406](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18406) |\n\n#### <a id=\"deprecated-cli-flags\"/>CLI Flags</a>\n\nAs part of the [Flag Naming Convention Migration](#flag-naming-convention-migration), **989 CLI flags** across all Vitess binaries have been deprecated in their underscore format.

 -- Single-shard query\n```\n\n#### UNION Query Merging Improvements\n\nUNION query optimization has been significantly enhanced ([PR #18289](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18289), [PR #18393](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18393)):\n\n**Extended UNION Merging**: UNION queries with `Equal` and `IN` opcodes can now be merged more aggressively, generating simpler SQL.\n\n**Derived Table Elimination**: Unnecessary derived table wrapping is avoided for UNION queries, producing cleaner and more efficient SQL.\n\n**Example**:\n```sql\n-- Query:\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 1\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 2;\n\n-- Before v23: Wrapped in derived table\nSELECT * FROM (\n    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 1\n    UNION\n    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 2\n) AS dt;\n\n-- After v23: Direct UNION (simpler, more efficient)\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 1\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id = 2;\n```\n\n#### Multi-Shard Read-Only Transactions in SINGLE Mode\n\nRead-only transactions can now span multiple shards when using `SINGLE` transaction mode ([PR #18173](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18173)).\n\n**Before v23**: SINGLE mode restricted all transactions to single shards, even read-only ones.\n\n**After v23**: Read-only transactions can access multiple shards in SINGLE mode, improving flexibility without sacrificing consistency guarantees.\n\n**Impact**: Applications using SINGLE transaction mode can now perform multi-shard read queries within transactions without needing to upgrade to MULTI or TWOPC modes.\n\n#### Deferred Optimization for Prepared Statements\n\nPrepared statements now support deferred optimization ([PR #18126](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18126)), allowing preparation to succeed even when plan generation requires runtime values.\n\n**Benefits**:\n- More prepared statements succeed at preparation time\n- Better support for queries with parameter-dependent optimization\n- Reduced application errors from failed PREPARE statements\n\n**Behavior**: When a prepared statement cannot be fully optimized at preparation time, optimization is deferred to execution time when bind variable values are available.\n\n#### Query Buffering for INSTANT DDL\n\nQuery buffering has been implemented for `INSTANT` DDL operations ([PR #17945](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17945)), reducing query failures during schema changes.\n\n**Features**:\n- Automatic buffering of queries during INSTANT DDL execution\n- Forced termination of blocking transactions\n- Transparent to applications\n\n**Impact**: Applications experience fewer query errors during schema changes, improving availability during DDL operations.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"minor-changes-topo\"/>Topology</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"consul-auth-static-file-check-creds\"/>`--consul-auth-static-file` requires 1 or more credentials</a>\n\nThe `--consul-auth-static-file` flag used in several components now requires that 1 or more credentials can be loaded from the provided json file ([PR #18152](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18152)).\n\n**Impact**: Configurations with empty or invalid credential files will now fail at startup rather than silently continuing with no authentication.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"minor-changes-vtorc\"/>VTOrc</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"aggregated-discovery-metrics-api-removed\"/>Aggregated Discovery Metrics HTTP API removed</a>\n\nVTOrc's undocumented `/api/aggregated-discovery-metrics` HTTP API endpoint was removed ([PR #18672](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18672)). The list of documented VTOrc APIs can be found [here](https://vitess.io/docs/current/reference/vtorc/ui_api_metrics/#apis).\n\nWe recommend using the standard VTOrc metrics to gather the same metrics.

If you rely on this functionality often, for example in automation, this may be signs of an anti-pattern. If so, please open an issue to discuss supporting your use case natively in VTOrc.**\n\nThe new `vtctldclient` RPC `SetVtorcEmergencyReparent` was introduced ([PR #17985](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17985)) to allow VTOrc recoveries involving `EmergencyReparentShard` actions to be disabled on a per-keyspace and/or per-shard basis. Previous to this version, disabling EmergencyReparentShard-based recoveries was only possible globally/per-VTOrc-instance. VTOrc will now consider this keyspace/shard-level setting that is refreshed from the topo on each recovery. The disabled state is determined by first checking if the keyspace, and then the shard state. Removing a keyspace-level override does not remove per-shard overrides.\n\nTo provide observability of keyspaces/shards with EmergencyReparentShard-based VTOrc recoveries disabled, the `EmergencyReparentShardDisabled` metric was added. This metric label can be used to create alerting to ensure EmergencyReparentShard-based recoveries are not disabled for an undesired period of time.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\n# Disable ERS recoveries for a keyspace\nvtctldclient SetVtorcEmergencyReparent --keyspace commerce --enabled=false\n\n# Disable ERS recoveries for a specific shard\nvtctldclient SetVtorcEmergencyReparent --keyspace commerce --shard 80- --enabled=false\n\n# Re-enable ERS recoveries\nvtctldclient SetVtorcEmergencyReparent --keyspace commerce --enabled=true\n```\n\n#### <a id=\"recoveries-stats-keyspace-shard\"/>Recovery stats to include keyspace/shard</a>\n\nThe following recovery-related stats now include labels for keyspaces and shards ([PR #18304](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18304)):\n1. `FailedRecoveries`\n2. `PendingRecoveries`\n3. `RecoveriesCount`\n4. `SuccessfulRecoveries`\n\nPrevious to this release, only the recovery \"type\" was included in labels. See [Modified Metrics](#modified-metrics) for more details.\n\n#### <a id=\"replication-analysis-api-deprecation\"/>`/api/replication-analysis` HTTP API deprecation</a>\n\nThe `/api/replication-analysis` HTTP API endpoint is now deprecated and is replaced with `/api/detection-analysis` ([PR #18615](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18615)), which currently returns the same response format.\n\n**Timeline**: The `/api/replication-analysis` endpoint will be removed in a future version. Users should migrate to `/api/detection-analysis`.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"minor-changes-vttablet\"/>VTTablet</a>\n\n#### <a id=\"api-changes\"/>API Changes</a>\n\n- **Added** `RestartReplication` method to `TabletManagerClient` interface ([PR #18628](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18628)). This new RPC allows stopping and restarting MySQL replication with semi-sync configuration in a single call, providing a convenient alternative to separate `StopReplication` and `StartReplication` calls.\n\n- **Added** `GetMaxValueForSequences` and `UpdateSequenceTables` gRPC RPCs ([PR #18172](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18172)) for VReplication sequence management during `SwitchWrites` operations.\n\n#### <a id=\"flags-vttablet\"/>CLI Flags</a>\n\n- `--skip-user-metrics` flag if enabled, replaces the username label with \"UserLabelDisabled\" to prevent metric explosion in environments with many unique users ([PR #18085](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18085)).\n\nSee [New CLI Flags](#new-cli-flags) for complete list of new flags.\n\n#### <a id=\"mysql-caching-sha2-password\"/>Managed MySQL configuration defaults to caching-sha2-password</a>\n\nThe default authentication plugin for MySQL 8.0.26 and later is now `caching_sha2_password` instead of `mysql_native_password` ([PR #18010](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18010)). This change is made because `mysql_native_password` is deprecated and removed in future MySQL versions. `mysql_native_password` is still enabled for backwards compatibility.\n\nThis change specifically affects the replication user. If you have a user configured with an explicit password, it is recommended to make sure to upgrade this user after upgrading to v23 with a statement like the following:\n\n```sql\nALTER USER 'vt_repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'your-existing-password';\n```\n\nIn future Vitess versions, the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin will be disabled for managed MySQL instances.\n\n#### <a id=\"mysql-timezone-env\"/>MySQL timezone environment propagation</a>\n\nFixed a bug where environment variables like `TZ` were not propagated from mysqlctl to the mysqld process ([PR #18561](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18561)).\nAs a result, timezone settings from the environment were previously ignored. Now mysqld correctly inherits environment variables.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Deployment Impact**: Deployments that relied on the old behavior and explicitly set a non-UTC timezone may see changes in how DATETIME values are interpreted. To preserve compatibility, set `TZ=UTC` explicitly in MySQL pods.\n\n#### <a id=\"grpctmclient-err-changes\"/>gRPC `tabletmanager` client error changes</a>\n\nThe `vttablet` gRPC `tabletmanager` client now returns errors wrapped by the internal `go/vt/vterrors` package ([PR #18565](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18565)). External automation relying on google-gRPC error codes should now use `vterrors.Code(err)` to inspect the code of an error, which returns `vtrpcpb.Code`s defined in [the `proto/vtrpc.proto` protobuf](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/vtrpc.proto#L60).\n\nSee [Breaking Changes](#grpc-error-codes) for migration guidance.\n\n---\n\n### <a id=\"docker\"/>Docker</a>\n\n[Bullseye went EOL 1 year ago](https://www.debian.org/releases/), so starting from v23, we will no longer build or publish images based on debian:bullseye ([PR #18609](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18609)).\n\nBuilds will continue for Debian Bookworm, and add the recently released Debian Trixie. v23 explicitly does not change the default Debian tag to Trixie.\n\n------------\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/23.0/23.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 246 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @Arshdeep54, @BenjaminLockhart, @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @HenryCaiHaiying, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @bantyK, @beingnoble03, @canoriz, @chapsuk, @chrisplim, @corbantek, @davidpiegza, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @derekperkins, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @jdoupe, @jeefy, @leejones, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @mhamza15, @morgo, @mounicasruthi, @nickvanw, @notfelineit, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shlomi-noach, @siddharth16396, @stankevich, @stutibiyani, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @twthorn, @vitess-bot, @wukuai, @yoheimuta\n", "created_at": "2025-11-04T14:36:03Z", "project": "Vitess", "repo": "vitessio/vitess", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-11-19T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "MooseFS 4.58.2", "tag_name": "v4.58.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs/releases/tag/v4.58.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs", "body": "This is a maintenance release focused on improving master-to-master timeout handling, fixing client-side read-ahead behavior, and correcting minor typos.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Master\r\n\r\n- **Changed timeouts used in master-to-master connections (Pro only)**  \r\n  Handling of timeouts between Master and Follower processes has been improved.\r\n  \r\n  Previously, when the Master used a large amount of RAM (around 500 GiB), the fork operation (used for metadata writes or replication to Followers) could take longer than 10 seconds, which caused failures because the metadata fetch module had a hardcoded 10 second limit.  \r\n\r\n  Changes include:\r\n  \r\n  - Unified variable naming: `MATOMA_TIMEOUT` now replaces `MASTER_TIMEOUT` in Master configuration, consistent with other timeout variables.\r\n  - The metadata download module now respects configured timeout values.\r\n  - The leader measures fork duration and, if it takes too long, instructs Followers to use a higher timeout automatically.  \r\n    This prevents timeout errors during metadata synchronization, even when `MATOMA_TIMEOUT` is set too low.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Important Upgrade Recommendation\r\n\r\nWe **strongly recommend upgrading** for all users running Master instances that use large amounts of memory (around 500 GiB or more). Older versions carry a risk that, if a follower becomes desynchronized for any reason, it may fail to resynchronize due to timeout loops. In such cases, recovery would require an emergency upgrade instead of a planned one.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a smooth upgrade:\r\n\r\n1. Follow the standard upgrade procedure, **starting with Followers**.\r\n2. Before upgrading Followers, **set the config variable** `MATOMA_TIMEOUT` **to a value higher than 10 seconds** (e.g., 30 seconds is very safe).\r\n3. After upgrading the leader, you may reduce the timeout again (e.g., back to 10 seconds) and monitor logs.  \r\n   - If log messages indicate that a fork takes longer than the timeout, increase it as suggested in the logs.\r\n\r\nNote: The **old leader version** does not automatically enforce longer timeouts, so **manually increasing `MATOMA_TIMEOUT` during the upgrade is essential**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n\r\n- **Fixed test for overlapping requests in the read-ahead algorithm**  \r\n  (Pull request by @chuandew)\r\n  \r\n  A typo in a variable might have caused overlapping chunk reads in the read-ahead cache. While it worked correctly, the behavior was slightly inefficient. The fix ensures that overlapping reads are avoided and the cache now behaves as originally intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n## All\r\n\r\n- **Fixed typos and spelling errors**  \r\n  Various minor textual corrections contributed by community members, especially @onlyjob and @tianon).", "created_at": "2025-11-03T14:42:05Z", "project": "MooseFS", "repo": "moosefs/moosefs", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v20.2.0", "html_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ceph/ceph/commits/69f84cc2651aa259a15bc192ddaabd3baba07489", "repo_url": "https://github.com/ceph/ceph", "body": "20.2.0\n\nSigned-off-by: Ceph Release Team <ceph-maintainers@ceph.io>", "created_at": "2025-10-30T15:22:24Z", "project": "Ceph", "repo": "ceph/ceph", "type": "Storage", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "1.11.2 / 2025-10-30", "tag_name": "v1.11.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/releases/tag/v1.11.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway", "body": "* [BUGFIX] Update dependencies to pull in possibly relevant bugfixes.\r\n", "created_at": "2025-10-30T11:50:19Z", "project": "Pushgateway", "repo": "prometheus/pushgateway", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.20.0", "tag_name": "knative-v1.20.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.20.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/knative/serving", "body": "## \ud83d\udea8 Breaking or Notable Changes\r\n\r\n#### Metrics and Tracing\r\n\r\nIn v1.19 we've dropped support for OpenCensus (which has been deprecated for a while) in favour of OpenTelemetry. This is a breaking change and details are documented here in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQ_ubc0RjeZbRHdN4rQR85Z7RZfTSjz4GoKsE0dZ2Z0/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.n8a530nnrb=). and the website (https://knative.dev/docs/serving/observability/metrics/collecting-metrics/)\r\n\r\n#### Secure Pod Defaults  (#16042, @nader-ziada)\r\n\r\nWe've introduce `secure-pod-defaults` in an earlier release but this release includes a new setting `AllowRootBounded` that offers a better security posture for your workloads but balances the compatibility with images that require/expect you to run as root. \r\n\r\nFor `v1.20` release the `secure-pod-defaults` default will remain `disabled` but in a future release (most likely `v1.21`) we will switch this default to `AllowRootBounded`. \r\n\r\n_If you're unsure whether your workloads will support this new setting you should explicitly set this option to `disabled` prior to upgrading to `v1.21`._\r\n\r\nFor more information see the [documentation](https://knative.dev/development/serving/configuration/secure-pod-defaults/) and reach out if you foresee issues in your testing.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcab New Features & Changes\r\n\r\n* Create a new value for `secure-pod-defaults`: `AllowRootBounded`\r\n    - when AllowRootBounded, defaults SeccompProfile and Capabilities if nil\r\n    - when enabled sets RunAsNonRoot to true if not already specified (#16042, @nader-ziada)\r\n* Made it possible to configure the `httputil.ReverseProxy` or add `http.Handler`s to queue-proxy in out-of-tree builds.

Changes\r\n\r\n## Distroless Envoy image\r\n\r\nThe Envoy image used in the example manifests and as the default image in the Gateway Provisioner has been switched to the [distroless](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/install#image-variants) variant.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was based on Ubuntu and included a minimal OS with a package manager.\r\nThe distroless variant contains only the files required to run Envoy, improving security.\r\n\r\n(#7170, @tsaarni)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Update to Gateway API v1.3.0\r\n\r\nGateway API CRD compatibility has been

Update to Go 1.25.1. See the [Go release notes](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.25.minor) for more information. (#7211, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates Envoy to v1.35.2.

users can now perform a global fuzzy search on the key and value of configuration items, making it easier to locate where the configuration is being used across applications, environments, clusters, and namespaces. See [Configuration queries (administrator privileges)](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_17-configuration-queries-administrator-privileges).\r\n\r\n### Observer Mode for Application AccessKey \r\nBefore officially enabling application keys, you can configure Application AccessKeys in observation mode to only log without intercepting configuration retrieval.\r\n\r\n### Limitation on the Number of Namespaces and Configuration Items\r\nUsers can now limit the number of namespaces and also the number of configuration items in a single namespace. See [Parameter settings for limiting the number of namespaces in the appld+cluster dimension](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_64-parameter-settings-for-limiting-the-number-of-namespaces-in-the-appldcluster-dimension) and [Limitation on the number of configuration items in a single namespace](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_65-limitation-on-the-number-of-configuration-items-in-a-single-namespace).\r\n\r\n### Cluster-Level Permission Control Support\r\nUsers can now configure editing and publishing permissions for namespaces based on cluster granularity. [Configuring permissions for different dimensions](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/portal/apollo-user-guide?id=_123-configuring-permissions-for-different-dimensions).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n*
