Thanks to @Coffeeri for the contribution (#3074)\r\n\r\n### Improved:\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - KeyValue memory store performance for history of 1 (#3081)\r\n    - A check was done twice (per message) for max_msg_per_subject and discard_new policy, which is the case for KV stores (#3101)\r\n    - Reduce the number of RAFT warnings to 1 per second (for exact same log line) (#3100)\r\n    - Bumped the default file store block size (#3102)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - When reaching the max number of pull requests, the server would evict existing pending requests (with a `408 Request Canceled`) instead of sending a `409 Exceeded MaxWaiting` to the new request (#3099) \r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Step-down timing for consumers or streams. When becoming leader a consumer's stream sequence number could be reset (#3079)\r\n    - Not able to recover a consumer if a source based stream which housed the consumer filter subject was removed. Also made updates to the `/healthz` behavior (#3080)\r\n    - File store compaction would not work well for blocks with small messages and lots of interior deletes. The index file was also written too often (#3087)\r\n    - Subject transforms and delivery subjects (#3088)\r\n    - Lock inversion, but no known situations that would have triggered it (#3092)\r\n    - Possible panic when checking for RAFT group leaderless status (#3094)\r\n    - A pull consumer with a MaxWaiting of 1 would not send the notification that the request timed-out (#3099)\r\n    - RAFT and clustering issues that may have contributed to repeated warnings about inability to store an entry to WAL and expected first catchup entry to be a snapshot and peer state (#3100)\r\n- Permissions:\r\n    - Queue subscription's deny subjects were not always enforced. CVE-2022-29946 (#3090)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-05-04T19:12:16Z", "project": "NATS", "repo":

Per-queue memory footprint was reduced for some\r\nworkloads. Queue operations produce less runtime GC pressure.\r\n\r\nQuorum queues now support [message TTL](https://rabbitmq.com/ttl.html), at-most-once and at-least-once\r\nstrategies for dead-lettering, an operationally safer re-queue operation behavior,\r\nand can be used for durable MQTT subscriptions in new clusters.\r\n\r\n3.10.0 is the first release to introduce Erlang 25 support ([at RC stage](https://www.erlang.org/news/156) at the time of writing)\r\nwhich includes JIT support for 64-bit ARM processors.\r\n\r\nClassic queues now ship a new message store and queue index implementation known as CQv2.\r\nThe operator must opt in to use them, CQv1 is still used by default.\r\n\r\nDefinition re-import on node restart now can be skipped if the source (a file, directory or a file retrieved over HTTPS)\r\nhas not changed. Queue and exchange re-import is now more efficient, the speed-up is over two orders of magnitude\r\nin some environments.\r\n\r\nThe OAuth 2 plugin provides a way to map \"non-standard\" or \"alias\" scopes\r\nto a set of RabbitMQ permissions.\r\n\r\n## Obtaining Packages\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/), and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\nThis release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. Erlang 24 is recommended as it [offers 20%-50% throughput improvements](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) for many workloads.\r\n\r\n[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 23.3.x and 24.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrading to 3.10\r\n\r\nSee the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ 3.10.0 nodes can run alongside `3.9.x` nodes. `3.10.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster\r\nupgrade to 3.10.0 or any other patch release in the series.\r\n\r\nWhile operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.\r\nOnce all nodes are upgraded to 3.10.0, these irregularities will go away.\r\n\r\nMixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended\r\nperiods of time (no more than a few hours).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility Notes\r\n\r\n### Client Library Compatibility\r\n\r\nClient libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.9.x` will be compatible with `3.10.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Upgrading to Erlang 24.x\r\n\r\nRabbitMQ `3.8.16` and later require Erlang `23.2` and support Erlang `24` (recommended).\r\nUsers of RabbitMQ versions that [do not support Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) should first upgrade to the latest `3.8.x` patch release on Erlang 23.2,\r\nthen upgrade to `3.10.0`, and ideally Erlang 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\n\r\nAny questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes Worth Mentioning\r\n\r\nRelease notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.10.x/release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Core Server\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Reduced memory footprint of quorum queues. Quorum queues now move enqueues messages to disk as quickly as\r\n   possible, ignoring the `x-max-in-memory-length` and `x-max-in-memory-bytes` policy keys. This reduces per-queue memory footprint\r\n   and makes throughput and latency less variable.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3898](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3898)\r\n\r\n * New classic queue index and message store implementations. This makes memory footprint of classic queues less variable\r\n   and on average, lower than before. Consumer delivery is more efficient, potentially increasing throughput for workloads\r\n   where consumers do keep up with producers.\r\n\r\n   This implementation is not enabled by default. It can be enabled using a policy:\r\n\r\n   ``` shell\r\n   rabbitmqctl set_policy cq_version \"^cq\\.\" '{\"queue-version\": 2}' --priority 1 --apply-to queues\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   or set via `rabbitmq.conf`:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   classic_queue.default_version = 2\r\n   ```\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3029](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3029)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues now support [message TTL](https://rabbitmq.com/ttl.html).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3121](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3121)\r\n\r\n * Reduced per-queue garbage collection.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4110](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4110)\r\n\r\n * Stream replication connections now adopt [TLS settings configured for inter-node communication links](https://rabbitmq.com/clustering-ssl.html).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3553](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3553)\r\n\r\n * Quorum queues now support two [dead lettering](https://rabbitmq.com/dlx.html) strategies, at-most-once (the 3.9 quorum queue and classic queue behavior)\r\n   and at-least-once.\r\n\r\n   To use at-least-once the user must opt-in.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3100](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3100)\r\n\r\n * Messages delivered by a quorum queue and negatively acknowledged with a requeue will be added to the back of the queue\r\n   until the queue has redelivery limit set. With a redelivery limit, requeueing will use the original position of the message\r\n   if possible.\r\n\r\n   This improves operational safety: consumers that get stuck or requeue deliveries at a high rate will not indefinitely\r\n   grow quorum queue Raft log, potentially driving the node out of disk space.\r\n\r\n   ![Breaking change](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Breaking%20change-red) This is a **potentially breaking change**.\r\n   Applications can make sure quorum queues have a redelivery limit\r\n   set if the original behavior is important to keep.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3776](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3776)\r\n\r\n * [Boot time definition sync](https://rabbitmq.com/definitions.html#import-on-boot) now can be skipped if definition source (e.g. file or directory) contents\r\n   have not changed:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   definitions.skip_if_unchanged = true\r\n\r\n   definitions.import_backend = local_filesystem\r\n   definitions.local.path = /path/to/definitions/defs.json\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4062](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4062)\r\n\r\n * Classic mirrored queues peak eager sync throughput now can be limited.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @thuandb (AWS).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3925](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3925)\r\n\r\n * [Optional queue arguments](https://rabbitmq.com/queues.html#optional-arguments) are now more strictly validated at queue\r\n   declaration time, as are optional consumer arguments when new consumers subscribe.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4572](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4572)\r\n\r\n * Headers exchanges (AMQP 0-9-1) now support a new matching strategy, `\"any-with-x\"`,\r\n   which works the same way as `\"any\"` but also considers headers that begin with\r\n   an `\"x-\"`.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4143](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4143)\r\n\r\n * Queues can no longer be created in a vhost while deletion of that vhost is in progress\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @tomyouyou.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4260](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4260)\r\n\r\n * rabbitmqctl encode/decode can now accept more values via standard input\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4258](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4258)\r\n\r\n * rabbitmq_tracing now uses local time for timestamps\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4277](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4277)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Internal API and Other Changes\r\n \r\n * Two rarely used classic queue metrics have been removed. Their removal reduces pressure\r\n   on internal table writes and boosts classic queue v1 throughput by 10 to 20 percent.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @felixhuettner.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4431](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4431)\r\n\r\n * Tracing and `idle_since` timestamps now reflect local time in RFC 3339 format. Previously\r\n   a custom format was used for these timestamps and they always reflected UTC time.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4276](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4276)\r\n   \r\n * Inter-node message transfer is optimized for the case where a message is only routed to one queue.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @tomyouyou.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3865](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3865)\r\n\r\n * Definition import now can be extended to support arbitrary sources. This is done\r\n   by providing a module that implements three functions: `is_enabled/0`, `load/1`, `load_with_hashing/3`.\r\n   The module can then should be specified as the `definitions.import_backend` value:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   definitions.import_backend = rabbit_definitions_import_our_custom_backend\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3311](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3311)\r\n\r\n\r\n * Elixir 1.13 is now supported at build time.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4108](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4108)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\nThis release includes all applicable [bug fixes that shipped in `3.9.x` releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html).\r\n\r\n * Addressed a performance regression for large fanouts when streams were not enabled.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4073](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4073)\r\n\r\n * Stream delivery rate could drop if concurrent stream consumers consumed in a way\r\n   that made them reach the end of the stream often.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4371](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4371)\r\n\r\n * Channels could confirm a subset of messages published as mandatory in some cases.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3870](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3870)\r\n\r\n * Direct Erlang client initialisation had a race condition with earlier boot steps,\r\n   which could lead plugins that depend on it to fail to open connections.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3685](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3685)\r\n\r\n * Exclusive queues are always placed on local node.\r\n\r\n   [Exclusive queues](https://rabbitmq.com/queues.html#exclusive-queues) are by definition node-local because they are tied to the lifecycle of\r\n   their declaring connection, which is node-local.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3341](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3341)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prometheus Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Prometheus collector could run into an exception early on node's\r\n   schema database sync.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4376](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4376)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Management Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * `idle_since` field now uses RFC 3339 format.\r\n\r\n   ![Breaking change](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Breaking%20change-red) This is a **potentially breaking change**.\r\n   Sample value with the previous format: `2022-03-22 11:39:37`.

Enabling this setting in a cluster with existing\r\n   durable subscription data of MQTT clients will make it impossible for them to\r\n   subscribe without **explicit queue deletion** by the cluster operator.\r\n\r\n   To opt in to use quorum queues for durable MQTT subscriptions, use the `mqtt.durable_queue_type`\r\n   configuration key in `rabbitmq.conf`:\r\n\r\n   ``` ini\r\n   mqtt.durable_queue_type = quorum\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4401](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4401)\r\n\r\n\r\n### OAuth 2 AuthN and AuthZ Backend Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n*  The plugin now supports scope aliases. In some environments, it's unrealistic to\r\n   adopt JWTs that follow the `scope` convention assumed by the plugin. Instead,\r\n   identity services fill `scope` or `claims` field with a \"role name\" or \"role alias\"\r\n   that implicitly maps to a set of scopes/permissions.\r\n\r\n   With this feature, RabbitMQ operators can map those values to a set of\r\n   scopes that can be translated to RabbitMQ permissions.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4588](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4588)\r\n\r\n * Improvements to JKW support and new HTTPS settings.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @anhanhnguyen (Erlang Solutions).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3887](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3887)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Shovel Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n * Dynamic Shovels can be deleted or restarted from any cluster node\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @kostakal.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4242](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4242)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Shovels with automatic deletion threshold of `0` are now correctly deleted immediately.\r\n\r\n   Contribited by @luos (Erlang Solutions).\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4098](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4098)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Consul Peer Discovery Plugin\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n * Handle a response code change in Consul 1.11.\r\n\r\n   Contributed by @maestroes.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#4149](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4149)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependency Changes\r\n\r\n * `ra` upgraded from [`2.0.0` to `2.0.9`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.9)\r\n * `osiris` upgraded from [`1.0.0` to `1.2.6`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/compare/v1.0.0...v1.2.6)\r\n * `ranch` upgraded from [`2.0.0` to `2.1.0`](https://github.com/ninenines/ranch/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0)\r\n * `prometheus` upgraded from [`4.8.1` to `4.8.2`](https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus.erl/compare/06425c21a39c1564164f1cc3fe5bdfa8b23b1f78...v4.8.2)\r\n * `eetcd` upgraded from [`0.3.3` to `0.3.5`](https://github.com/zhongwencool/eetcd/compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.5)\r\n * `observer_cli` upgraded from [`1.6.2` to `1.7.3`](https://github.com/zhongwencool/observer_cli/compare/1.6.2...1.7.3)\r\n * `gen_batch_server` upgraded from [`0.8.6` to `0.8.7`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/gen-batch-server/compare/38191672ee0f22a8d5291c6c09f8c07178d565ca...v0.8.7)", "created_at": "2022-05-03T12:03:46Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "8.5.2 (2022-05-03)", "tag_name": "v8.5.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v8.5.2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana", "body": "\n[Download page](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.5.2)\n[What's new highlights](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/)\n\n\n### Features and enhancements\n\n- **Alerting:** Add safeguard for migrations that might cause dataloss.

([#5648](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5648))\n\n### Changes\n\n- Update the supported OLM versions to 0.18.3, 0.19.1, 0.20.0. ([#5684](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5684))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix: channel naming validator check and move it for the Good Practices validator. You are able to check it by running `operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle --select-optional name=good-practices` or `$ operator-sdk bundle validate ./bundle --select-optional suite=operatorframework` ([More info](https://github.com/operator-framework/api/pull/231)). ([#5552](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5552))\n- For ansible-based operators, this change fixes an issue that caused finalizers to fail to run if the watched resource (CR) is deleted during reconciliation. ([#5678](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pull/5678))\n- The related image discovery feature currently only reads environment variables from the manager container. This was causing an error when the deployment labels or container name that was expected were not present. This fixes that by collecting related images from all containers across all deployments.\nThis change also enables users to use related images in other containers since related images from everywhere will be considered.

Both built-in and non-built-in functions can be mocked:\r\n\r\n    package authz\r\n    import data.jwks.cert\r\n    import data.helpers.extract_token\r\n\r\n    allow {\r\n        [true, _, _] = io.jwt.decode_verify(extract_token(input.headers), {\"cert\": cert, \"iss\": \"corp.issuer.com\"})\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    test_allow {\r\n        allow\r\n          with input.headers as []\r\n          with data.jwks.cert as \"mock-cert\"\r\n          with io.jwt.decode_verify as [true, {}, {}] # mocked built-in\r\n          with extract_token as \"my-jwt\"              # mocked non-built-in\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor further information about policy testing with data and function mock, see [the Policy Testing docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.40.0/policy-testing/#data-and-function-mocking). All details about `with` can be found in its [Policy Language section](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.40.0/policy-language/#with-keyword).\r\n\r\nThis has been a much-requested feature, but it's @rmetcalf9's issue [#4449](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4449) that nudged this feature ahead.\r\n\r\n### Assignments with `:=`\r\n\r\nRemaining restrictions around the use of `:=` in rules and functions have been lifted ([#4555](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4555)). These constructs are now valid:\r\n\r\n    check_images(imgs) := x { # function\r\n      # ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    allow := x { # rule\r\n      # ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    response[key] := object { # partial object rule\r\n      # ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the wake of this, rules may now be \"redeclared\", i.e. you can use `:=` for more than one rule body:\r\n\r\n    deny := x {\r\n      # body 1\r\n    }\r\n    deny := x {\r\n      # body 2\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis was forbidden before, but didn't serve a real purpose: it would catch trivial-to-catch errors\r\nlike\r\n\r\n    p := 1\r\n    p := 2 # redeclared\r\n\r\nBut it would do no good in more difficult to debug \"multiple assignment\" problems like\r\n\r\n    p := x {\r\n      some x in [1, 2, 3]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Tooling, SDK, and Runtime\r\n\r\n- Status Plugin: Remove activeRevision label on all but one Prometheus metric ([#4584](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4584)) reported and authored by @costimuraru\r\n- Status: Include bundle type (\"snapshot\" or \"delta\") in status information\r\n- `opa capabilities`: Expose capabilities through CLI, and allow using versions when passing `--capabilities v0.39.0` to the various commands ([#4236](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4236)) authored by @IoannisMatzaris <!-- FC -->\r\n- Logging: Log warnings at WARN level not ERROR, authored by @damienjburks\r\n- Runtime: Persist activated bundle Etag to store ([#4544](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4544))\r\n- `opa eval`: Don't use source locations when formatting partially evaluated output ([#4609](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4609))\r\n- `opa inspect`: Fixing an issue where some errors encountered by the inspect command aren't properly reported\r\n- `opa fmt`: Fix a bug with missing whitespace when formatting multiple `with` statements on one indented line ([#4634](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4634))\r\n\r\n#### Experimental OCI support\r\n\r\nWhen configured to do so, OPA's bundle and discovery plugins will retrieve bundles from **any OCI registry**. Please see [the Services Configuration section](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.40.0/configuration/#services) for details.\r\n\r\nNote that at this point, it's best considered a \"feature preview\". Be aware of this:\r\n- Bundles are not cached, but re-retrieved and activated periodically.\r\n- The persistence directory used for storing retrieved OCI artifacts is not yet managed by OPA,\r\n  so its content may accumulate. By default, the OCI downloader will use a temporary file location.\r\n- The documentation on how to push bundles to an OCI repository currently only exists in the development\r\n  docs, see [OCI.md](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/v0.40.0/docs/devel/OCI.md).\r\n\r\nThanks to @carabasdaniel for starting the work on this!\r\n\r\n### Rego and Topdown\r\n\r\n- Builtins: Require prefix length for IPv6 in `net.cidr_merge` ([#4596](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4596)), reported by @alexhu20\r\n- Builtins: `http.send` can now parse and cache YAML responses, analogous to JSON responses\r\n- Parser: Guard against invalid domains for \"some\" and \"every\", reported by @doyensec\r\n- Formatting: Don't add 'in' keyword import when 'every' is there ([#4606](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4606))\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Policy Language: Reorder Universal Quantification content, stress `every` over other constructions ([#4603](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4603))\r\n- Language pages: Use assignment operator where it's allowed.\r\n- SSH Tutorial: Use bundle API\r\n- Annotations: Update \"Custom\" annotation section\r\n- Cloudformation: Fix markup and add warning related to booleans\r\n- Blogs: mention OAuth2 and OIDC blog posts\r\n\r\n### Website + Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Redirect previous patch releases to latest patch release ([#4225](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4225))\r\n- Add playground button to navbar\r\n- Add SRI to static html files\r\n- Remove right margin on sidebar (#4529) (authored by @orweis)\r\n- Show yellow banner for old version (#4533)\r\n- Remove unused variables to avoid error in strict mode(#4534) (authored by @panpan0000)\r\n- Ecosystem:\r\n  - Add AWS CloudFormation Hook\r\n  - Add GKE policy automation\r\n  - Add permit.io (authored by @ozradi)\r\n  - Add Magda (authored by @t83714) \r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Workflow: no content permissions for GitHub action 'post-release', authored by @naveensrinivasan\r\n- Various dependency bumps, notably:\r\n  - OpenTelemetry-go: 1.6.1 -> 1.6.3\r\n  - go.uber.org/automaxprocs: 1.4.0 -> 1.5.1\r\n- Binaries and Docker images are now built using Go 1.18.1.\r\n- Dockerfile: add source annotation (#4626)", "created_at": "2022-04-28T09:41:03Z", "project": "Open Policy Agent", "repo": "open-policy-agent/opa", "type": "Policy", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.23.6+k3s1", "tag_name": "v1.23.6+k3s1", "html_url": "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.23.6%2Bk3s1", "repo_url": "https://github.com/rancher/k3s", "body": "<!-- v1.23.6+k3s1 -->\r\nThis release updates Kubernetes to v1.23.6, and fixes a number of issues.\r\n\r\nFor more details on what's new, see the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1235).\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.23.5+k3s1:\r\n\r\n* Fixed etcd URL in case of IPv6 address [(#5325)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5325)\r\n* The flannel configuration passed to `--flannel-conf` may now use the flannel backend type \"wireguard\".

implementation for minimal `TaskRun` and `Run` statuses within `PipelineRun` statuses. \r\n\r\n* :sparkles: TEP-0090:  -  (#4707)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  Consuming `Results` in `Matrix` is invalid - will be supported soon to allow dynamic fan out.\r\n-  Consuming `Results` from fanned out `PipelineTasks` is invalid - will be revisited soon after array and object `Results` are supported. \r\n\r\n* :sparkles: TEP-0090:  -  (#4704)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`Parameters` in `Matrix`:\r\n- must be of type `Array`\r\n- must not be in `Params` field as well\r\n- must be declared in the `Parameters` in `Pipeline` specification\r\n\r\nNote that `Matrix` is not yet fully functional.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Promote Graceful termination to stable (#4668)\r\n\r\nPromoting graceful termination of pipelinerun to beta and keeping `PipelineRunCancelled` as deprecated, it will be removed after 3 releases\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Add pipelineRef remote resolution (#4596)\r\n\r\nInitial integration with tektoncd/resolution project, allowing pipelineRefs to be resolved directly from public git repos.\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: Use fields from PodTemplate when creating affinity-assistant pod (#4348)\r\n\r\n- A default pod template for affinity-assistant pods can now be set by the `default-affinity-assistant-pod-template` field in `config-defaults` ConfigMap. Template merge rules is the same as the generic Pod templates (the template specified in the `PipelineRun` or  `TaskRun` takes precedence over the one in the defaults).\r\n- The affinity-assistant Pod template now supports `ImagePullSecrets`.\r\n* :sparkles: [TEP-0100] Add new `updatePipelineRunStatusFromChildRefs` function (#4760)\r\n* :sparkles: [TEP-0100] Add functionality to be used in supporting minimal embedded status (#4757)\r\n\r\n# Deprecation Notices\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: Deprecating full embedded status in pipelineRun\r\n\r\nThe `PipelineRun.Status.TaskRuns` and `PipelineRun.Status.Runs` fields are deprecated and will be removed in January, 2023. Please find more details in the proposal - [TEP-0100](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0100-embedded-taskruns-and-runs-status-in-pipelineruns.md).\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: pipelineRunCancelled will be removed in v0.38\r\n\r\nWith 0.35, graceful termination of PipelineRuns is now a stable feature and is no longer behind alpha feature flag. For more information related to graceful cancellation, you can refer to [TEP-0058](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0058-graceful-pipeline-run-termination.md). Now, what this means is that the existing status PipelineRunCancelled which was deprecated in 0.25.0 release of Tekton Pipelines will be removed after 3 releases, i.e., in 0.38.0 release it will be removed completely and replaced by Cancelled in case of completely cancelling the PipelineRuns.\r\n\r\nNo changes need to be made to your Pipelines and Tasks. If you have tools to cancel the running pipeline, those tools will have to be updated in 0.38.0. This change also affects the tools such as Dashboard, CLI, IDE extensions,  etc. as they now need to start supporting the new PipelineRun statuses. Tekton CLI has already made the following changes and will be available in the new release 0.24.0.\r\n\r\n# Backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\nIn current release:\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: Removed feature flag - scope-when-expressions-to-task (#4715)\r\n\r\nIn [TEP-0007: Conditions Beta](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0007-conditions-beta.md), we introduced when expressions to guard execution of Tasks in Pipelines. To align with Conditions, we set scope of when expressions to the guarded Task and its dependent Tasks.\r\n\r\nIn [TEP-0059: Skipping Strategies](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/teps/0059-skipping-strategies.md), we proposed changing the scope of when expressions to the guarded Task only. This was implemented in https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4085. We provided a feature flag, scope-when-expressions-to-task, to support migration. It defaulted to false for 9 months per our [Beta API compatibility policy](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/api_compatibility_policy.md), meaning that we continued to guard the Task and its dependent Tasks. Then in https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4580, we flipped the flag to true to guard the Task only by default.\r\n\r\nIn this change, we remove the scope-when-expressions-to-task flag and complete the migration.\r\n\r\n* :rotating_light: Removed pullrequest-init-build-base (#4709)\r\n\r\nThe pullrequest-init-build-base seemed to include a root and nonroot user to account for the fact that PR directories and files may have been written by a different (possibly non-root) user, and needed to be read by the pullrequest-init container image. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, the image no longer needed to be based on a custom-built base image -- it seems like the rootful gcr.io/distroless/static base image is sufficient so removing pullrequest-init-build-base.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n* :bug: Fix git-init for Git 2.35.2 (#4756)\r\n\r\nFixed git-init behavior to work with Git 2.35.2 changes.\r\n\r\n* :bug: Avoid panic in PipelineRun reconciler for Runs with no owner refs (#4733)\r\n\r\nFix panic when reconciling PipelineRun with indirectly-created custom tasks.\r\n\r\n* :bug: Allow tasks to retry when PipelineRun stops (#4651)\r\n\r\n[Bug fix]: Allow TaskRuns/Runs to complete retries when PipelineRun is stopped, including graceful stopping\r\n\r\n* :bug: Add listType annotations (#4402)\r\n\r\n* :bug: Don't wait for TaskRun to be observed Running. (#4773)\r\n* :bug: Fix TestReconcileOnCompletedTaskRun (#4695)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Switch the franken-image to use  for linux images. (#4763)\r\n\r\nLinux builds for windows-compatible images now use gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot instead of gcr.io/distroless/base:debug-nonroot (drops glibc and busybox)\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Switch to  for  (#4762)\r\n\r\nThe default shell image is now nonroot by default, and much smaller.\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Use a new base image for the  image. (#4758)\r\n\r\nThe git-init image is now based on ghcr.io/distroless/git with fewer unused packages installed! \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n* :hammer: Bump to K8s 23 libs. (#4712)\r\n\r\nTekton Pipelines now uses k8s 23 libs\r\n* :hammer: migrate yaml package to sigs.k8s.io/yaml (#4754)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* :hammer: PullRequest PipelineResource expects root (#4718)\r\n\r\nThe pullrequest PipelineResource is updated to explicitly set its runAsUser to 0. PipelineResources aren't tested as anything other than the root user and this change makes that explicit.\r\n\r\nThe pullrequest-init base image also no longer uses the root user by default. It now defaults to using UID 65532.\r\n\r\n* :hammer: Update build pipeline to golang 1.17.8 (#4700)\r\n\r\nTekton build with golang 1.17.8\r\n* :hammer: A few minor cleanups in pkg/reconciler/pipelinerun/pipelinerun_test.go (#4785)\r\n* :hammer: Instrument e2e pipelinerun_test.go files for logstream (#4782)\r\n* :hammer: Instrument the kaniko test for logstream.

By default, kOps will set ShutdownGracePeriod to 30 seconds and ShutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods to 10 seconds if the Kubernetes version is above 1.21.\r\n\r\n* By enabling the [pod identity webhook](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/#pod-identity-webhook), you no longer need to modify your Pod specs to assume IAM roles.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The Weave CNI is not supported for Kubernetes 1.23 or later.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now has `disable-cnp-status-updates: true` by default. Set this to false if you rely on the CiliumNetworkPolicy status fields.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.19 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.25.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* The `kops create cluster` command has a new `--discovery-store` flag for specifying a public store for the OIDC-compatible discovery documents.\r\nIf this flag is used in AWS, it will enable IRSA.\r\n\r\n* If `externalDns.provider` is `external-dns`, then `externalDns.watchIngress` will now default to `true`.\r\n\r\n* This release introduces a `v1alpha3` API version. This API version is a work in progress and is likely to be replaced in kOps 1.24.\r\nIt is recommended to keep using the `v1alpha2` API version.\r\n\r\n* IPv6 pod subnets is in a working state using public IPv6 addresses for the Pod network. This works with both Cilium and Calico. IPv6 is still behind a feature flag until service controllers and addons implement support for IPv6. See [the IPv6 documentation](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/networking/ipv6/).\r\n\r\n* The `kops rolling-update cluster` command has a new `--drain-timeout` flag for specifying the maximum amount of time to wait when attempting to drain a node. Previously, rolling-updates would attempt to drain a node for an indefinite amount of time. If `--drain-timeout` is not specified, a default of 15 minutes is applied.\r\n\r\n* Fix inconsistent output of `kops get clusters -ojson`. This will now always return a list (irrespective of a single or multiple clusters) to keep the format consistent.

For more information see: [CVE-2021-36784](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-jwvr-vv7p-gpwq).\r\n- Fixed an issue that granted write permissions on `CatalogTemplates` or `CatalogTemplateVersions` to regular users when `restricted-admin` is enabled as default user in Rancher. For more information see: [CVE-2021-4200](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-hx8w-ghh8-r4xf).\r\n- Updated version of external `go-getter` library used in Fleet to avoid leaking SSH private keys in Rancher UI and in Fleet's deployment pod logs. For more information see: [GHSA-wm2r-rp98-8pmh](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-wm2r-rp98-8pmh).\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the [security advisories page](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- When an auth group is assigned to the Restricted Admin global role, not all permissions are properly applied and the Rancher logs are spammed with the error `RoleBinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io \"my-role-name\" is invalid`. See [#36621](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36621).\r\n- Equinix Metal driver version updated. See [#34742](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34742).\r\n- Cannot create a backup in Cluster Explorer after switching the interface language to Simplified Chinese. See [#33654](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33654).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/requirements/).\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** \r\n  - We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/).\r\n- **Helm version:** \r\n  - Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.17+ before installing Rancher 2.5+.\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution that uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air-gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air-gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air-gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** \r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) for information on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/).\r\n  - When installing in an air-gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and works as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n- **RKE requirements:** \r\n  - For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)`, please note that Edit and Save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit, and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).  \r\n- **EKS requirements:** \r\n  - There was a setting for Rancher versions prior to 2.5.8 that allowed users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: eks-refresh-cron. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: eks-refresh. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **Fleet-agent:** \r\n  - When upgrading `<=v2.5.7` to `>=v2.5.8`, you may notice that in Apps & Marketplace, there is a fleet-agent release stuck at uninstalling. This is caused by migrating fleet-agent release name. It is safe to delete fleet-agent release as it is no longer used, and doing so should not delete the real fleet-agent deployment since it has been migrated. See [#362](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/362).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Upgrades and Rollbacks:** \r\n  - Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback. Please note the version you would like to upgrade or roll back to change the Rancher version.\r\n  - Please be aware when upgrading to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher-launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n  - Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have an HA install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/) on how to upgrade cert-manager.\r\n  - Existing GKE clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n  - The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. Refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/#rolling-back-to-rancher-v2-5-0) for the new instructions.\r\n- **Important**: \r\n  - When rolling back, we are expecting you to roll back to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post-upgrade would not be reflected.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off:** \r\n  - In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. Access to the local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to **true** from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see the documentation.\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.5.13\r\n- rancher/rancher-agent:v2.5.13\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.4.11](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.4.11)\r\n- RKE - [v1.2.16](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.2.16)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- 1.20.14 (Default)\r\n- 1.19.16\r\n- 1.18.20\r\n- 1.17.17\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n\r\n |Feature | Justification |\r\n  |---|---|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Monitoring** | Monitoring in Cluster Manager UI has been replaced with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Alerts and Notifiers**| Alerting and notifiers functionality is now directly integrated with a new monitoring chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer.  |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Logging** | Functionality replaced with a new logging solution using a new logging chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - MultiCluster Apps**| Deploying to multiple clusters is now recommended to be handled with Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer.|\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Kubernetes CIS 1.4 Scanning**|  Kubernetes CIS 1.5+ benchmark scanning is now replaced with a new scan tool deployed with a cis benchmarks chart available in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Rancher Pipelines**|  Git-based deployment pipelines is now recommend to be handled with  Rancher Continuous Delivery powered by Fleet available in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Istio v1.5**| The Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5 and has recommended all users upgrade. Newer Istio versions are now available as a chart in the Apps & Marketplace in Cluster Explorer. |\r\n|**Cluster Manager - Provision Kubernetes v1.16 Clusters** | We have ended support for Kubernetes v1.16. Cluster Manager no longer provisions new v1.16 clusters. If you already have a v1.16 cluster, it is unaffected. |\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in v2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being rewritten and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Duplicated Features in Cluster Manager and Cluster Explorer\r\n- Only one version of the feature may be installed at any given time due to potentially conflicting CRDs.\r\n- Each feature should only be managed by the UI that it was deployed from.\r\n- If you have installed a feature in Cluster Manager, you must uninstall it in Cluster Manager before attempting to install the new version in Cluster Explorer dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Cluster Explorer Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n\r\n- **General:**\r\n  - Not all new features are currently installable on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - New features are expected to be deployed using the Helm 3 CLI and not with the Rancher CLI.\r\n- **UI Shell:**\r\n  - After closing the shell in the Rancher UI, be aware that the corresponding processes remain running indefinitely for each shell in the pod. See [#16192](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16192).\r\n- **Continuous Delivery:**\r\n  - Restricted admins are not able to create git repos from the Continuous Delivery option under Cluster Explorer; the screen will become stuck in a loading status. See [#4909](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4909).\r\n- **Rancher Backup:**\r\n  - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location; it must continue to use the same URL.\r\n- **Monitoring:**\r\n  - Monitoring sometimes errors on installation because it can't identify CRDs. See [#29171](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29171).\r\n- **Istio:**\r\n  - Be aware that when upgrading from Istio v1.7.4 or earlier to any later version, there may be connectivity issues. See [upgrade notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#connectivity-issues-among-your-proxies-when-updating-from-1-7-x-where-x-5) and [#31811](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31811).\r\n  - Starting in v1.8.x, [DNS is supported natively](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/upgrade-notes/#istio-coredns-plugin-deprecation). This means that the additional addon component `istioCoreDNS` is deprecated in v1.8.x and is not supported in v1.9x. If you are upgrading from v1.8.x to v1.9.x and you are using the `istioCoreDNS` addon, it is recommended that you disable it and switch to the natively supported DNS prior to upgrade. If you upgrade without disabling it, you will need to manually clean up your installation as it will not get removed automatically. See [#31761](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31761) and [#31265](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31265).\r\n  - Istio v1.10 and earlier versions are now End-of-life but are required for the upgrade path in order to not skip a minor version. See [#33824](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33824).\r\n\r\n### Cluster Manager Feature Caveats and Upgrades\r\n- **GKE:**\r\n  - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - When creating GKE clusters in Terraform, the `labels` field cannot be empty: at least one label must be set. See [#32553](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32553).\r\n- **EKS & GKE:**\r\n  - When creating EKS and GKE clusters in Terraform, string fields cannot be set to empty. See [#32440](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32440).\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).    \r\n    - After migrating from the in-tree vSphere cloud provider to the out-of-tree cloud provider, attempts to upgrade the cluster will not complete. This is due to nodes containing workloads with bound volumes before the migration failing to drain. Users will observe these nodes stuck in a `draining` state. Follow this [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102#issuecomment-943493870) to continue with the upgrade. See [#35102](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35102).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#35940](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35940) for more information.  \r\n- **Cluster Tools**\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** \r\n    - Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster. \r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring V2 on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n    - Monitoring V2 fails to scrape ingress-nginx pods on any nodes except for the one Prometheus is deployed on, if the security group used by worker nodes blocks incoming requests to port 10254. The workaround for this issue is to open up port 10254 on all hosts. See [#32563](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32563).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Logging (Cluster Explorer): Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing Helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio v1.5 is not supported in air-gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio v1.5.\r\n    - [Istio v1.10 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.10-eol-final/) on January 7th, 2022. \r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - In air-gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring, also called Monitoring V1, which is compatible with Kubernetes 1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes 1.15 clusters in an air-gapped environment, and you want to either install Monitoring V1 or upgrade Monitoring V1 to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes 1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart.\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use.\r\n  - **Installation requirements:**\r\n    - Importing a Kubernetes v1.21 cluster might not work properly and is unsupported.\r\n  - **Backup and Restore:**\r\n    - Reinstalling Rancher 2.5.x on the same cluster may fail due to a lingering `rancher.cattle.io.` MutatingWebhookConfiguration object from a previous installation. Manually deleting it will resolve the issue.  \r\n  - **Docker installs:** \r\n    - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. \r\n    - Users may receive an error message when logging in for the first time. See [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800).\r\n    - Users may be redirected to the login screen before a password and default view have been set.

These errors should stop after all the `vmselect` and `vmstorage` nodes are updated to new release. It is safe to downgrade to previous releases.\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): add support for `alert_relabel_configs` option at `-notifier.config`. This option allows configuring relabeling rules for alerts before sending them to configured notifiers. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html#notifier-configuration-file) for details.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): allow passing StatefulSet pod names to `-promscrape.cluster.memberNum` command-line flag. In this case the member number is automatically extracted from the pod name, which must end with the number in the range `0 ... promscrape.cluster.membersCount-1`. For example, `vmagent-0`, `vmagent-1`, etc. See [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2359) and [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#scraping-big-number-of-targets).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [VictoriaMetrics cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html): properly propagate limits at `-search.max*` command-line flags from `vminsert` to `vmstorage`. The limits are `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries`, `-search.maxSeries`, `-search.maxFederateSeries`, `-search.maxExportSeries`, `-search.maxGraphiteSeries` and `-search.maxTSDBStatusSeries`. They weren't propagated to `vmstorage` because of the bug. These limits were introduced in [v1.76.0](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html#v1760). See [this bug](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2450).\r\n* BUGFIX: fix goroutine leak and possible deadlock when importing invalid data via [native binary format](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#how-to-import-data-in-native-format). See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2423).\r\n* BUGFIX: [Graphite Render API](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#graphite-render-api-usage): properly calculate [hitCount](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.hitcount) function. Previously it could return empty results if there were no original samples in some parts of the selected time range.\r\n* BUGFIX: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): allow overriding built-in function names inside [WITH templates](https://play.victoriametrics.com/promql/expand-with-exprs). For example, `WITH (sum(a,b) = a + b + 1) sum(x,y)` now expands into `x + y + 1`. Previously such a query would fail with `cannot use reserved name` error. See [this bugreport](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metricsql/issues/5).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): properly display values greater than 1000 on Y axis. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2409).\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run

However, there might be problems in concurrent situations. With the new `DeletedAt` columns, unique indices are added for most of the tables. There are some manual steps for existing users to upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nAs was discussed in #3896, apollo-client drops java 1.7 support since the 2.0.0 release.

Cosign signs OCI artifacts and pushes the generated signature into Harbor. This signature is stored as an artifact accessory along side the signed artifact. Harbor manages a link between the signed artifact and cosign signature, allowing you to apply things like tag retention rules and immutable rules to a signed artifact, and it will extend to both the signed artifact and the signature. This allows you to use Harbor's built in functionality to manage signed artifacts and Cosign signature accessories. Cosign signatures are also subject to Harbor's replication rules and will be replicated at the same time as their signed artifact.\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n   - Improved performance for concurrent pull requests.\r\n   - Improved failure tolerance for garbage collection which is now able to continue deleting subsequent artifacts when an errors occurs trying to removing the current artifact.\r\n   - Replication now supports skipping artifacts in a proxy cache project.\r\n   - Activated distribution upload purging to remove orphaned files from the upload directories. \r\n   - Harbor is now built using Golang v1.17.7.\r\n   - Harbor now uses Distribution v2.8.0 and Trivy v0.22.0.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n   - As of Harbor v2.5, only PostgreSQL **>= 10** is supported for external databases. Before upgrading, you should make sure that your external databases are using a supported version of PostgreSQL.\r\n   \r\n## Deprecations\r\n   - The Harbor team is planning for the deprecation of Chartmuseum in a future release. You should consider using Helm v3.8+ to work with Harbor to manage the OCI compatible charts. Please note that Chartmuseum related feature request or bug reports may not be prioritized going forward. For more information about this deprecation see [this GitHub discussion topic](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/discussions/15057).\r\n\r\n## Resolved Issues \r\n- [Full list of issues fixed in v2.5.0](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atarget%2F2.5.0+is%3Aclosed)", "created_at": "2022-04-07T07:34:07Z", "project": "Harbor", "repo": "goharbor/harbor", "type": "Registry", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "pack v0.25.0", "tag_name": "v0.25.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/tag/v0.25.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack", "body": "# pack v0.25.0\r\n> This is a **beta** release of the Cloud Native Buildpack local CLI.

This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners. The status of the various components as of v3.2.0 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CSI Drivers \r\n    - [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/mayastor) 1.0.1 (beta)\r\n    - [cStor](https://github.com/openebs/cstor-operators) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Jiva](https://github.com/openebs/jiva-operator) 3.2.0 (beta) \r\n    - [Local PV ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv) 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV LVM](https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv) 0.9.0 (stable)\r\n    - [Local PV Rawfile](https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv) 0.6.0 (beta)\r\n    - [Local PV Partitions](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv) 0.6.0 (alpha)\r\n- Out-of-tree provisioners \r\n  - [Local PV hostpath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Local PV device](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) 3.2.0 (stable)\r\n  - [Dynamic NFS Volume](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner) 0.9.0 (beta)\r\n- Other components\r\n  - [NDM](https://github.com/openebs/node-disk-manager) 1.9.0 (beta)\r\n  - [CLI](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl) 0.5.0 (beta)\r\n  - [Dashboard](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring) 0.4.10 (beta)\r\n\r\n### Change Summary\r\n\r\nA detailed Changelog is available under the component repositories listed above.  The focus was to close on the refactoring and maintenance-related activities and a few bug fixes that were required for some of the components to be declared GA or beta. Here is a quick summary of what has changed since the last release. \r\n\r\n* [Data populator](https://github.com/openebs/data-populator) (alpha)\r\n* Add support for log and log streams for upgrade jobs for Jiva\r\n* added manager errors for Jiva for better debuggability \r\n* fixed Jiva controller issue where service does not select controller pods\r\n* fixed NDM issue where disk partition cannot be released after creating lvm\r\n* fixed concurrent map write issue in cstor-csi\r\n* fixed OpenEBS security vulnerablility in github action\r\n* added node selector and toleration to ndm exporter\r\n* fixed xfs quota issue for LVM volumes in dynamic-localpv\r\n* made ZFS-LocalPV aware of pool import\r\n* fixed cstor-csi to avoid simultaneous creation and deletion of resource\r\n* enahanced LVM-LocalPV to pick the node for provisioning the volume where there is enough free space available\r\n* honor klog logging options for dynamic-localpv\r\n\r\nIn-Progress items \r\n\r\n* shared volume group support for LVM-LocalPV (https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/pull/184)\r\n* CNCF infra migration (https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3511)\r\n \r\n### Show your Support\r\n\r\nThank you @RytisLT(Rytis Ilciukas) for sharing your [OpenEBS Adoption story](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/adopters/users/RytisLT/README.md). \r\n\r\nAre you using or evaluating OpenEBS?

[#6300](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/6300)\r\n- Git LFS client (with version >= 2.5.0) wasn't able to upload files with known format (e.g. PNG, JPEG), and the server is expecting the HTTP Header `Content-Type` to be `application/octet-stream`. The server now tells the LFS client to always use `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` when upload files.\r\n\r\n## 0.12.2\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- _Regression_: Pages are correctly rendered when requesting ?go-get=1 for subdirectories. #6314\r\n- _Regression_: Submodule with a relative path is linked correctly. #6319\r\n- Backup can be processed when --target is specified on Windows. #6339\r\n- Commit message contains keywords look like an issue reference no longer fails the push entirely. #6289\r\n\r\n## 0.12.1\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- The `updated_at` field is now correctly updated when updates an issue. [#6209](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/6209)\r\n- Fixed a regression which created `login_source.cfg` column to have `VARCHAR(255)` instead of `TEXT` in MySQL.

Plugin maintainers who may be using the packer-plugin-check as part of their release pipeline are encouraged to move to the packer-sdc command. As an alternative, maintainers can continue to use the packer-plugin-check by pinning the command to Packer 1.7.10.

The env argument \r\n    is an alternative to using environment_vars for setting environment variables, \r\n    which has the added ability to read from Packer datasources.
