1.17.6: Both release executables and Docker images are built with this Go release.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Ability to get per-subject details via `StreamInfo` responses. The request needs to include a `subjects_filter:<subject>` for the server to include the list. The `StreamInfo` structure now has `NumSubjects` that will always be set, but optionally `Subjects` which contains the list of distincts subjects present in the stream with the count of messages per subject (#2833)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Dynamic account behaviors. The server option `AllowNewAccounts` and function `NewAccountsAllowed()` have been removed. Note that the option could only be set for applications embedding the NATS Server since configuration parsing was not parsing this option (#2840)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- JetStream:\r\n    - Adding streams may fail with \"insufficient resources\" in some cases (#2824)\r\n    - Possible panic when attempting to update a push consumer by removing the deliver subject (#2829)\r\n    - Consumer updates were not updated on disk and would be reverted after a server restart. Thanks to @oliverpool for the report (#2830)\r\n    - Behavior of a stream when `MaxMsgsPerSubject` is set along with `DiscardNew` discard policy. Unless the stream is reaching a limit, old messages will be removed on a per-subject basis (#2831)\r\n    - A pull request `no_wait:true` without expiration was not considering redeliveries (#2832)\r\n    - `BackOff` redeliveries would always use the first delay from the list if the consumer's sequence was not matching the stream sequence (#2834)\r\n    - Under certain scenarios, the number of pending messages (unprocessed messages reported by the NATS CLI) for a consumer could appear to get stuck at 0 (#2835) \r\n    - When a consumer had no filtered subject and was attached to an interest policy retention stream, the server could incorrectly drop messages (#2838)\r\n\r\n### Complete Changes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/compare/v2.7.1...v2.7.2\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2022-02-04T21:57:59Z", "project": "NATS", "repo": "nats-io/nats-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Release v1.31.0", "tag_name": "v1.31.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases/tag/v1.31.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger", "body": "### Backend Changes\r\n#### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements\r\n\r\n* Bump Go compiler in CI to 1.17.6 ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [#3516](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/3516))\r\n* Add support for ES index aliases / rollover to the dependency store (Resolves #2143) ([@frittentheke](https://github.com/frittentheke) in [#2144](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/2144))\r\n* Use existing functions from xdg-go/scram pkg ([@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro) in [#3481](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/3481))\r\n\r\n### UI Changes\r\n\r\n* UI pinned to version 1.20.1.

This would never allow the value of \r\nzero to be set. Users can set the value to be -1 which will represent disabling \r\nthe retry count. If not specified or set to zero, then the Envoy default value \r\nof 1 is used.\r\n\r\n(#4117, @stevesloka)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: implement PathPrefix matching\r\n\r\nContour now implements Gateway API v1alpha2's \"path prefix\" matching for `HTTPRoutes`.\r\nThis is now the only native form of prefix matching supported by Gateway API, and is a change from v1alpha1.\r\nPath prefix matching means that the prefix specified in an `HTTPRoute` rule must match entire segments of a request's path in order to match it, rather than just be a string prefix.\r\nFor example, the prefix `/foo` would match a request for the path `/foo/bar` but not `/foobar`.\r\nFor more information, see the [Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.PathMatchType).\r\n\r\n(#4119, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Add Envoy Deployment Example\r\n\r\nThe examples now include a way to deploy Envoy as a Deployment vs a Daemonset.\r\nThis can assist in allowing Envoy to drain connections cleanly when the Kubernetes cluster size is scaled down.\r\n\r\n(#4126, @stevesloka)\r\n\r\n## Default status on HTTPProxy resources\r\n\r\nWhen a new HTTPProxy is created, if Contour isn't yet running or\r\nfunctioning properly, then no status is set on the resource. \r\nDefaults of \"NotReconciled/Waiting for controller\" are now applied \r\nto any new object until an instance of Contour accepts the\r\nobject and updates the status.\r\n\r\n(#4133, @stevesloka)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: support ReferencePolicy\r\n\r\nContour now supports the `ReferencePolicy` CRD in Gateway API v1alpha2.\r\n`ReferencePolicy` enables certain cross-namespace references to be allowed in Gateway API.\r\nThe primary use case is to enable routes (e.g. `HTTPRoutes`, `TLSRoutes`) to reference backend `Services` in different namespaces.\r\nWhen Contour processes a route that references a service in a different namespace, it will check for a `ReferencePolicy` that applies to the route and service, and if one exists, it will allow the reference.\r\n\r\n(#4138, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Source IP hash based load balancing\r\n\r\nContour users can now configure their load balancing policies on `HTTPProxy` resources to hash the source IP of a client to ensure consistent routing to a backend service instance. Using this feature combined with header value hashing can implement advanced request routing and session affinity. Note that if you are using a load balancer to front your Envoy deployment, you will need to ensure it preserves client source IP addresses to ensure this feature is effective.\r\n\r\nSee [this page](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.20.0/config/request-routing/#load-balancing-strategy) for more details on this feature.\r\n\r\n(#4141, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Gateway API: set Gateway Listener status fields\r\n\r\nContour now sets the `.status.listeners.supportedKinds` and `.status.listeners.attachedRoutes` fields on Gateways for Gateway API.\r\nThe first describes the list of route groups/kinds that the listener supports, and the second captures the total number of routes that are successfully attached to the listener.\r\n\r\n(#4160, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## TLS Certificate validation updates\r\n\r\nContour now allows non-server certificates that do not have a CN or SAN set, which mostly fixes\r\n[#2372](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/2372) and [#3889](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/3889).\r\n\r\nTLS documentation has been updated to make the rules for Secrets holding TLS information clearer.\r\n\r\nThose rules are:\r\n\r\nFor certificates that identify a server, they must:\r\n- be `kubernetes.io/tls` type\r\n- contain `tls.crt`, and `tls.key` keys with the server certificate and key respectively.\r\n- have the first certificate in the `tls.crt` bundle have a CN or SAN field set.\r\n\r\nThey may:\r\n- have the `tls.crt` key contain a certificate chain, as long as the first certificate in the chain is the server certificate.\r\n- add a `ca.crt` key that contains a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate or certificates.\r\n\r\nCertificates in the certificate chain that are not server certificates do not need to have a CN or SAN.\r\n\r\nFor CA secrets, they must:\r\n- be `Opaque` type\r\n- contain only a `ca.crt` key, not `tls.crt` or `tls.key`\r\n\r\nThe `ca.crt` key may contain one or more CA certificates, that do not need to have a CN or SAN.\r\n\r\n(#4165, @youngnick)\r\n\r\n## HTTPProxy TCPProxy service weights are now applied\r\n\r\nPreviously, Contour did not apply any service weights defined in an HTTPProxy's TCPProxy, and all services were equally weighted.\r\nNow, if those weights are defined, they are applied so traffic is weighted appropriately across the services.\r\nNote that if no TCPProxy service weights are defined, traffic continues to be equally spread across all services.\r\n\r\n(#4169, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## Leader Election Configuration\r\n\r\n`contour serve` leader election configuration via config file has been deprecated.\r\nThe preferred way to configure leader election parameters is now via command line flags.\r\nSee [here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.20.0/configuration/#serve-flags) for more detail on the new leader election flags.\r\n\r\n*Note:* If you are using the v1alpha1 ContourConfiguration CRD, leader election configuration has been removed from that CRD as well.\r\nLeader election configuration is not something that will be dynamically configurable once Contour implements configuration reloading via that CRD.\r\n\r\n(#4171, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## Set Gateway listener conditions\r\n\r\nContour now sets various Gateway listener conditions as it processes them, including the \"Ready\", \"Detached\", and \"ResolvedRefs\" condition types, to provide more visibility to the user as to whether their listeners are defined correctly or not.\r\n\r\n(#4186, @skriss)\r\n\r\n## HTTP Request Redirect Policy \r\n\r\nHTTPProxy.Route now has a HTTPRequestRedirectPolicy which allows for routes to specify a RequestRedirectPolicy.\r\nThis policy will allow a redirect to be configured for a specific set of Conditions within a single route.\r\nThe policy can be configured with a `Hostname`, `StatusCode`, `Scheme`, and `Port`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Services on a Route are now optional when a request redirect is defined.\r\n\r\n(#4201, @stevesloka)\r\n\r\n## Transition to controller-runtime managed leader election\r\n\r\nContour now utilizes [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) Manager based leader election and coordination of subroutines.\r\nWith this change, Contour is also transitioning away from using a ConfigMap for leader election.\r\nIn this release, Contour now uses a combination of ConfigMap and Lease object.\r\nA future release will remove usage of the ConfigMap resource for leader election.\r\n\r\nThis change should be a no-op for most users, however be sure to re-apply the relevant parts of your deployment for RBAC to ensure Contour has access to Lease and Event objects (this would be the ClusterRole in the provided example YAML).\r\n\r\n(#4202, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n\r\n## HTTPRedirectPolicy allows for Path rewriting\r\n\r\nAdds a `Path` & `Prefix` field to the `HTTPProxy.Spec.Route.RequestRedirectPolicy` which allows\r\nfor redirects to also specify the path or prefix to redirect to. When specified, an\r\nHTTP 302 response will be sent to the requestor with the new path or prefix specified.\r\n\r\n_Note: Only one of path or prefix can be specified on a single route._\r\n\r\nSample HTTPProxy: \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1\r\nkind: HTTPProxy\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: redirect-path\r\nspec:\r\n  virtualhost:\r\n    fqdn: redirect.projectcontour.io\r\n  routes:\r\n    - conditions:\r\n        - prefix: /blog\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: blogservice\r\n          port: 80\r\n      requestRedirectPolicy:\r\n        path: /blog/site\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequest: \r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -i http://redirect.projectcontour.io/blog                                                                                                \r\n\r\nHTTP/2 302 \r\nlocation: http://redirect.projectcontour.io/blog/site\r\nvary: Accept-Encoding\r\ndate: Wed, 15 Dec 2021 20:42:04 GMT\r\nserver: envoy\r\n```\r\n\r\n(#4244, @stevesloka)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n- Sets conditions of \"Accepted: false\" and \"ValidBackendRefs: false\" on `TLSRoutes` when all backend refs have a weight of 0 explicitly set.

(#4120, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: adds support for the \"RequestRedirect\" HTTPRoute filter type at the rule level. (#4123, @skriss)\r\n- Update to using Envoy bootstrap Admin [`access_log` field](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/accesslog/v3/accesslog.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-accesslog-v3-accesslog) instead of deprecated `access_log_path` (deprecated in Envoy v1.18.0) (#4142, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Update to using Envoy [XFF Original IP Detection extension](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/http/original_ip_detection/xff/v3/xff.proto) instead of HTTPConnectionManager `xff_num_trusted_hops` field (deprecated in Envoy v1.19.0) (#4142, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- HTTPProxy resources now support wildcard fqdn's in the form `*.projectcontour.io`. (#4145, @stevesloka)\r\n- Adds a new field, `withRequestBody`, within HTTPProxy's `authorizationServer` to allow client request body to be sent to the external authorization server. See [External Authorization Configuration Overview](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_authz/v3/ext_authz.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-extensions-filters-http-ext-authz-v3-extauthz) for more information. (#4148, @abhide)\r\n- Timeout for upstream network connection timeout increased from 250 msec to 2 seconds. (#4151, @tsaarni)\r\n- Fix accidental negation of disableAllowChunkedLength configuration flag. (#4152, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Replaces the use of the dynamic Kubernetes client with the controller-runtime client. (#4153, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: Contour no longer sets up RBAC for TCPRoutes and UDPRoutes or watches them, since they are not supported. (#4166, @skriss)\r\n- Very long (~100 characters) Ingress path prefix matches should now no longer be rejected by Envoy. See [this issue](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/4191) for context. (#4197, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Removes spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished from certgen job in versioned releases, as immediately deleting it upon completion will not be useful for most consumers. (#4200, @lrewega)\r\n- Gateway API: set an HTTPRoute condition of \"ValidMatches: false\" when a path match does not start with '/' or contains consecutive '/' characters. (#4209, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: allow Gateways to reference TLS certificates in other namespaces when an applicable ReferencePolicy is defined. See [the Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/guides/tls/#cross-namespace-certificate-references) for more information. (#4212, @skriss)\r\n- Gateway API: \"core\" is no longer allowed as a magic string to reference the core Kubernetes API group. Instead, the empty string should be used to align with the Gateway API spec. (#4219, @skriss)\r\n- Updates Go version to 1.17.5, which includes fixes for CVE-2021-44716 and CVE-2021-44717.

(#4236, @skriss)\r\n- Contour has been updated to run on Kubernetes 1.23. It is now tested against Kubernetes 1.21 through 1.23. (#4261, @skriss)\r\n- Update Gateway API to v0.4.1 (#4268, @skriss)\r\n- Adds a new Ingress annotation, `projectcontour.io/tls-cert-namespace`, to allow [TLS Certificate Delegation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/tls-delegation/) to be used with Ingress v1. (#4271, @pablo-ruth)\r\n- Bump Envoy to v1.21.0. See [release notes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.21.0/version_history/current). (#4273, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Fixes bug in certgen error handling when writing certs to kubernetes. (#4281, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Fixes a bug where the global headers policy `ApplyToIngress` field was being ignored, causing Ingresses never to have the global headers policy applied. (#4287, @skriss)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Docs Changes\r\n- Pare down docs versions available in site dropdown. (#4020, @sunjayBhatia)\r\n- Updates the cert-manager guide to use the latest versions of Contour and cert-manager as well as Ingress v1 resources. (#4115, @skriss)\r\n- The [Contour deprecation policy](https://projectcontour.io/resources/deprecation-policy/) for Alpha APIs has been updated to be explicitly more lenient in regards to behavior changes and field removal.

"https://github.com/rancher/rancher", "body": "> It is important to review the Install/Upgrade Notes below before upgrading to any Rancher version.\r\n\r\n**Upgrading to Rancher v2.6.3-patch1:**\r\n- For Helm, use the following command. Take note of the additional `rancherImageTag` parameter and be sure to change `namespace` and `hostname` as needed for your configuration:\r\n\r\n    helm upgrade rancher rancher-latest/rancher \\\r\n      --namespace cattle-system \\\r\n      --set hostname=rancher.my.org \\\r\n      --set rancherImageTag=v2.6.3-patch1\r\n\r\n- For Docker, use the standard upgrade command:\r\n\r\n    docker run -d --privileged --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher:v2.6.3-patch1\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rancher v2.6.3-patch1 addresses additional issues including, but not limited to:**\r\n\r\n- On upgrade, any namespaces created with resource quotas should either be deleted or edited again (which will correct the invalid resource quotas). Failure to do so will result in resource quotas failing to apply to all other namespaces in the same project. See [#4804](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4804).\r\n- Fixed an issue where a broken websocket connection would redirect users to the login page when accessing the Cluster Explorer. See [#32934](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32934).\r\n- Cluster health checks no longer fail from random downstream clusters becoming unreachable. See [#36191](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36191).\r\n- Downstream clusters are no longer missing from Docker installations of Rancher after upgrading when volumes are bound. See [#36178](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36178).\r\n- New and existing rancher-webhook deployments will automatically renew their TLS certificates when the expiration date is 30 days or less. See [#36177](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/36177).\r\n# Features and Enhancements\r\n\r\n### New Experimental Features\r\n\r\nKubernetes v1.22 is being introduced in Rancher v2.6.3 as an experimental feature. As such, Rancher doesn't support provisioning 1.22 clusters or having Rancher run on 1.22 clusters at this time. Support will become available at a later time.\r\n\r\n### New in Harvester\r\n\r\n- Harvester v1.0.0 is GA and is only supported by Rancher v2.6.3.\r\n- Harvester v0.3.0 is not supported by Rancher v2.6.3. You must delete your Harvester v0.3.0 cluster from Rancher before upgrading Rancher.\r\n- Virtualization Management\r\n  - Importing a Harvester cluster no longer needs the manual `kubectl` command. Refer [here](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/virtualization-management/) for details.\r\n- RKE1\r\n  - Rancher provisioned RKE1 clusters now support installing Harvester Cloud Provider Chart and CSI Driver Chart.  No more manual configuration is needed.\r\n  - Additional UI enhancement has been added to the RKE1 Load Balancer page to support the Harvester Load Balancer configuration. No more manual annotation is needed.\r\n  - Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/cloud-provider/) for more details.\r\n- RKE2\r\n  - Rancher provisioned RKE2 clusters will have Harvester Load Balancer and CSI driver installed automatically.\r\n  - Additional UI enhancement has been added to the RKE2 Load Balancer page to support the Harvester Load Balancer configuration.\r\n  - Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/rancher/cloud-provider/) for more details.\r\n\r\n### UI Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Scaling up or down of a workload is now enabled in the Rancher UI. See [#4328](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4328).\r\n- The scale and health status of a workload is now visible in workload view. See [#4329](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4329).\r\n- Added ability to pause orchestration for workloads. See [#4331](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4331).\r\n- Added dashboards for workload metrics into the Rancher UI. See [#1879](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/1879).\r\n- Support added to Azure node driver to use images from Apps & Marketplace. See [#33518](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33518).\r\n- UI page load times improved. See [#34721](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34721).\r\n\r\n### Security Enhancements\r\n\r\n- By default, only passwords with at least 12 characters are accepted per new password policy in Rancher. See [#34851](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34851).\r\n- Starting with v1.22, RKE1 no longer rewrites SELinux labels on container volume mounts. Please see the [security docs](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/security/selinux/) for information on how to install the rancher-selinux RPM to ensure SELinux policies are configured. See [#2541](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2541) for reference.\r\n\r\n### Other New Features\r\n\r\n- Authorized Cluster Endpoint can now be enabled on downstream imported RKE2/K3s clusters. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/registered-clusters/#authorized-cluster-endpoint-support-for-rke2-and-k3s-clusters) and [#35161](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35161) for details.\r\n- The Rancher Monitoring chart has been upgraded to match the upstream `kube-prometheus-stack` version 19.0.3. See [#34577](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34577).\r\n\r\n# Major Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue in which RKE1 and RKE2 Clusters were becoming stuck in Removing state. See [#35180](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35180).\r\n- Rancher-related namespaces are now removed after cluster agents are removed on imported provider clusters. See [#34990](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34990).\r\n- Fixed issue in which cluster failed to communicate with API server after etcd role node is removed. See [#34488](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34488).\r\n- Downstream clusters behind a proxy are now supported when RKE2 cluster is upgraded. See [#32633](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32633).\r\n- The API Server has been updated to fix slow consumers causing deadlocks. See [#34906](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/pull/34906).\r\n- When in installed apps under Apps & Marketplace in a cluster, navigating to workloads after selecting namespace works. See [#4428](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4428).\r\n\r\n# Install/Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n> - If you are installing Rancher for the first time, your environment must fulfill the [installation requirements.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/)\r\n> - The namespace where the local Fleet agent runs has been changed to `cattle-fleet-local-system`. This change does not impact GitOps workflows.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Creating backups:** We strongly recommend creating a backup before upgrading Rancher. To roll back Rancher after an upgrade, you must back up and restore Rancher to the previous Rancher version. Because Rancher will be restored to its state when a backup was created, any changes post upgrade will not be included after the restore. For more information, see the [documentation on backing up Rancher.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/back-up-rancher/)\r\n- **Helm version:** Rancher install or upgrade must occur with Helm 3.2.x+ due to the changes with the latest cert-manager release. See [#29213](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29213).\r\n- **Kubernetes version:**\r\n  - The local Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher server should be upgraded to Kubernetes 1.18+ before installing Rancher 2.6+.\r\n  - When using Kubernetes v1.21 with Windows Server 20H2 Standard Core, the patch \"2019-08 Servicing Stack Update for Windows Server\" must be installed on the node. See [#72](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/72).\r\n- **CNI requirements:**\r\n  - For Kubernetes v1.19 and newer, we recommend disabling firewalld as it has been found to be incompatible with various CNI plugins. See [#28840](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28840).\r\n  - If upgrading or installing to a Linux distribution which uses nf_tables as the backend packet filter, such as SLES 15, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.10, Debian 10, or newer, users should upgrade to RKE1 v1.19.2 or later to get Flannel version v0.13.0 that supports nf_tables. See [Flannel #1317](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/issues/1317).\r\n  - For users upgrading from `>=v2.4.4` to `v2.5.x` with clusters where ACI CNI is enabled, note that upgrading Rancher will result in automatic cluster reconciliation. This is applicable for Kubernetes versions `v1.17.16-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher1-1`, `v1.17.17-rancher2-1`, `v1.18.14-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.15-rancher1-1`, `v1.18.16-rancher1-1`, and `v1.18.17-rancher1-1`. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002#issuecomment-818374779) BEFORE upgrading to `v2.5.x`. See [#32002](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32002).\r\n- **Requirements for air gapped environments:**\r\n  - For installing or upgrading Rancher in an air gapped environment, please add the flag `--no-hooks` to the `helm template` command to skip rendering files for Helm's hooks. See [#3226](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/3226).\r\n  - If using a proxy in front of an air gapped Rancher, you must pass additional parameters to `NO_PROXY`. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/behind-proxy/install-rancher/) and [#2725](https://github.com/rancher/docs/issues/2725#issuecomment-702454584).\r\n- **Cert-manager version requirements:** Recent changes to cert-manager require an upgrade if you have a high-availability install of Rancher using self-signed certificates. If you are using cert-manager older than v0.9.1, please see the documentation on how to upgrade cert-manager. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/upgrading-cert-manager/).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs:**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n  - When upgrading a Docker installation, a panic may occur in the container, which causes it to restart. After restarting, the container comes up and is working as expected. See [#33685](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33685).\r\n\r\n### Rancher Behavior Changes\r\n\r\n- **Legacy features are gated behind a feature flag.** Users upgrading from Rancher <=v2.5.x will automatically have the `--legacy` feature flag enabled. New installations that require legacy features need to enable the flag on install or through the UI.\r\n- **Users must manually remove legacy services.** When workloads created using the legacy UI are deleted, the corresponding services are not automatically deleted. Users will need to manually remove these services. A message will be displayed notifying the user to manually delete the associated services when such a workload is deleted.  See [#34639](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34639).\r\n- **Charts from library and helm3-library catalogs can no longer be launched.** Users will no longer be able to launch charts from the library and helm3-library catalogs, which are available through the legacy apps and multi-cluster-apps pages. Any existing legacy app that was deployed from a previous Rancher version will continue to be able to edit its currently deployed chart. Note that the Longhorn app will still be available from the library for new installs but will be removed in the next Rancher version. All users are recommended to deploy Longhorn from the Apps & Marketplace section of the Rancher UI instead of through the Legacy Apps pages.\r\n- **The local cluster can no longer be turned off.** In older Rancher versions, the local cluster could be hidden to restrict admin access to the Rancher server's local Kubernetes cluster, but that feature has been deprecated. The local Kubernetes cluster can no longer be hidden and all admins will have access to the local cluster. If you would like to restrict permissions to the local cluster, there is a new [restricted-admin role](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) that must be used. The access to local cluster can now be disabled by setting `hide_local_cluster` to true from the v3/settings API. See the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) and [#29325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/29325). For more information on upgrading from Rancher with a hidden local cluster, see [the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#upgrading-from-rancher-with-a-hidden-local-cluster)\r\n- **Users must log in again.** After upgrading to `v2.6+`, users will be automatically logged out of the old Rancher UI and must log in again to access Rancher and the new UI. See [#34004](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34004).\r\n- **Fleet is now always enabled.** For users upgrading from `v2.5.x` to `v2.6.x`, note that Fleet will be enabled by default as it is required for operation in `v2.6+`. This will occur even if Fleet was disabled in `v2.5.x`. During the upgrade process, users will observe restarts of the `rancher` pods, which is expected. See [#31044](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31044) and [#32688](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32688).\r\n- **The Fleet agent in the local cluster now lives in `cattle-fleet-local-system`.** Starting with Rancher v2.6.1, Fleet allows for two agents in the local cluster for scenarios where \"Fleet is managing Fleet\". The _true_ local agent runs in the new `cattle-fleet-local-system` namespace. The agent downstream from another Fleet management cluster runs in `cattle-fleet-system`, similar to the agent _pure_ downstream clusters. See [#34716](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34716) and [#531](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/531).\r\n- **Editing and saving clusters can result in cluster reconciliation.** For users upgrading from `<=v2.4.8 (<= RKE v1.1.6)` to `v2.4.12+ (RKE v1.1.13+)`/`v2.5.0+ (RKE v1.2.0+)` , please note that Edit and save cluster (even with no changes or a trivial change like cluster name) will result in cluster reconciliation and upgrading `kube-proxy` on all nodes [because of a change in `kube-proxy` binds](https://github.com/rancher/rke/pull/2214#issuecomment-680001568). This only happens on the first edit and later edits shouldn't affect the cluster. See [#32216](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32216).\r\n- **The EKS cluster refresh interval setting changed.** There is currently a setting allowing users to configure the length of refresh time in cron format: `eks-refresh-cron`. That setting is now deprecated and has been migrated to a standard seconds format in a new setting: `eks-refresh`. If previously set, the migration will happen automatically. See [#31789](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/31789).\r\n- **System components will restart.** Please be aware that upon an upgrade to v2.3.0+, any edits to a Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster will cause all system components to restart due to added tolerations to Kubernetes system components. Plan accordingly.\r\n- **New GKE and AKS clusters will use Rancher's new lifecycle management features.** Existing GKE and AKS clusters and imported clusters will continue to operate as-is. Only new creations and registered clusters will use the new full lifecycle management.\r\n- **New steps for rolling back Rancher.** The process to roll back Rancher has been updated for versions v2.5.0 and above. New steps require scaling Rancher down to 0 replica before restoring the backup. Please refer to the [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/rollbacks/) for the new instructions.\r\n- **RBAC differences around Manage Nodes for RKE2 clusters.** Due to the change of the provisioning framework, the `Manage Nodes` role will no longer be able to scale up/down machine pools. The user would need the ability to edit the cluster to manage the machine pools [#34474](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34474).\r\n- **New procedure to set up Azure cloud provider for RKE2.** For RKE2, the process to set up an Azure cloud provider is different than for RKE1 clusters. Users should refer to the [documentation]({{<baseurl>}}//rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/cloud-providers/azure/) for the new instructions. See [#34367](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34367) for original issue.\r\n- **Machines vs Kube Nodes.** In previous versions, Rancher only displayed Nodes, but with v2.6, there are the concepts of `machines` and `kube nodes`. Kube nodes are the Kubernetes node objects and are only accessible if the Kubernetes API server is running and the cluster is active. Machines are the cluster's machine object which defines what the cluster *should* be running.\r\n- **Rancher's External IP Webhook chart no longer supported in v1.22.** In v1.22, upstream Kubernetes has enabled the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips) to reject usage of external IPs. As such, the `rancher-external-ip-webhook` chart that was created as a workaround is no longer needed, and support for it is now capped to Kubernetes v1.21 and below. See [#33893](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33893).\r\n- **Requirements for Docker installs.**\r\n  - When starting the Rancher Docker container, the privileged flag must be used. [See the documentation.](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/other-installation-methods/single-node-docker/)\r\n  - When installing in an air gapped environment, you must supply a custom `registries.yaml` file to the `docker run` command as shown in the [K3s documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). If the registry has certs, then you will need to also supply those. See [#28969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28969#issuecomment-694474229).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Legacy Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the legacy Rancher UI is now 2000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n- **Increased memory limit for Monitoring.** The default value of the Prometheus memory limit in the new Rancher UI is now 3000Mi to prevent the pod from restarting due to a OOMKill. See [#34850](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34850).\r\n\r\n# Versions\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [README](https://github.com/rancher/rancher#latest-release) for latest and stable versions.\r\n\r\nPlease review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/choosing-version/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n- rancher/rancher:v2.6.3\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- CLI - [v2.6.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.6.0)\r\n- RKE - [v1.3.3](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v1.3.3)\r\n\r\n### Kubernetes Versions\r\n- v1.22.4 (Experimental)\r\n- v1.21.7 (Default)\r\n- v1.20.13\r\n- v1.19.16\r\n- v1.18.20\r\n\r\n### Rancher Helm Chart Versions\r\n\r\nStarting in 2.6.0, many of the Rancher Helm charts available in the Apps & Marketplace will start with a major version of 100. This was done to avoid simultaneous upstream changes and Rancher changes from causing conflicting version increments. This also brings us into compliance with semver, which is a requirement for newer versions of Helm. You can now see the upstream version of a chart in the build metadata, for example: `100.0.0+up2.1.0`. See [#32294](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32294).\r\n\r\n# Other Notes\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\nFeature flags introduced in 2.6.0 and the Harvester feature flag introduced in 2.6.1 are listed below for reference:\r\n\r\nFeature Flag | Default Value | Description\r\n---|---|---\r\n`harvester` | `true` | Used to manage access to the Harvester list page where users can navigate directly to Harvester host clusters and have the ability to import them.\r\n`fleet`| `true` | The previous `fleet` feature flag is now required to be enabled as the fleet capabilities are leveraged within the new provisioning framework. If you had this feature flag disabled in earlier versions, upon upgrading to Rancher, the flag will automatically be enabled.\r\n`gitops` | `true` | If you want to hide the \"Continuous Delivery\" feature from your users, then please use the newly introduced `gitops` feature flag, which hides the ability to leverage Continuous Delivery.\r\n`rke2` | `true` | \tWe have introduced the ability to provision RKE2 clusters as tech preview. By default, this feature flag is enabled, which allows users to attempt to provision these type of clusters.\r\n`legacy` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | There are a set of features from previous versions that are slowly being phased out of Rancher for newer iterations of the feature. This is a mix of deprecated features as well as features that will eventually be moved to newer variations in Rancher. By default, this feature flag is disabled for new installations. If you are upgrading from a previous version, this feature flag would be enabled.\r\n`token-hashing` | `false` for new installs, `true` for upgrades | Used to enable new token-hashing feature. Once enabled, existing tokens will be hashed and all new tokens will be hashed automatically using the SHA256 algorithm. Once a token is hashed it cannot be undone. Once this feature flag is enabled it cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Features\r\n\r\nRancherD was introduced in 2.5 as an easy-to-use installation binary. With the introduction of RKE2 provisioning, this project is being re-written and will be available at a later time. See [#33423](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33423).\r\n\r\n### Legacy Features\r\n\r\nLegacy features are features hidden behind the `legacy` feature flag, which are various features/functionality of Rancher that was available in previous releases. These are features that Rancher doesn't intend for new users to consume, but if you have been using past versions of Rancher, you'll still want to use this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you first start 2.6, there is a card in the Home page that outlines the location of where these features are now located.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated features from v2.5 are now behind the `legacy` feature flag. Please review our [deprecation policy](https://rancher.com/support-matrix/) for questions.\r\n\r\nThe following legacy features are no longer supported on Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Logging\r\n* CIS Scans\r\n* Istio 1.5\r\n* Pipelines\r\n\r\nThe following legacy feature is no longer supported past Kubernetes v1.21+ clusters:\r\n\r\n* Monitoring V1\r\n\r\n### Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n- **Kubernetes Cluster Distributions:**\r\n  - **RKE:**\r\n    - Rotating encryption keys with a custom encryption provider is not supported. See [#30539](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/30539).\r\n    - Actions that can\u2019t be performed by a cluster member, `Download KubeConfig` and `Take Snapshot`, are being shown as available on RKE1 clusters in a Rancher setup. See [#35828](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35828).\r\n  - **RKE2 - Tech Preview:** There are several known issues as this feature is in tech preview, but here are some major issues to consider before using RKE2.\r\n    - Amazon ECR Private Registries are not functional. See [#33920](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33920).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support Rancher Apps & Marketplace. See [#34405](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34405).\r\n    - Windows clusters do not yet support upgrading RKE2 versions. See Windows [#76](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/76).\r\n    - Rancher v2.6.3 cannot deploy RKE2 Windows clusters with versions 1.21.6+rke2r1 and below due to system agent updates. Note that RKE2 clusters with v1.21.7rc2 and higher are compatible with Rancher v2.6.3. See [#122](https://github.com/rancher/windows/issues/122).\r\n    - When provisioning using a RKE2 cluster template, the `rootSize` for AWS EC2 provisioners does not currently take an integer when it should, and an error is thrown. To work around this issue, wrap the EC2 `rootSize` in quotes. See [#3689](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/3689).\r\n    - RKE2 clusters are not able to be provisioned using the AWS cloud provider in Kubernetes v1.22. Note that RKE2 clusters in v1.21 function as expected. See [#35618](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35618).\r\n    - Standard users will not be able to create a cluster after clicking the `Edit as YAML` button. They will receive an error even if attempting to then `Edit as a Form`. To work around this issue, start over and create the cluster without clicking the `Edit as YAML` button. See [#35868](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35868).\r\n  - **AKS:**\r\n    - When editing or upgrading the AKS cluster, do not make changes from the Azure console or CLI at the same time. These actions must be done separately. See [#33561](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33561).\r\n    - Windows node pools are not currently supported. See [#32586](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32586).\r\n    - Azure Container Registry-based Helm charts cannot be added in Cluster Explorer, but do work in the Apps feature of Cluster Manager. Note that when using a Helm chart repository, the `disableSameOriginCheck` setting controls when credentials are attached to requests. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/#repositories) and [#34584](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34584) for more information.\r\n  - **GKE:**\r\n    - Basic authentication must be explicitly disabled in GCP before upgrading a GKE cluster to 1.19+ in Rancher. See [#32312](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32312).\r\n  - **AWS:**\r\n    - In an HA Rancher server on Kubernetes v1.20, ingresses on AWS EC2 node driver clusters do not go through and result in a `failed calling webhook` error. Please refer to the [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754#issuecomment-995566492) and [#35754](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35754).\r\n- **Infrastructures:**\r\n  - **vSphere:**\r\n    - The vSphere CSI Driver does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to unsupported v1beta1 CRD APIs. Support will be added in a later release, but in the meantime users with the `CSIMigrationvSphere` feature enabled should not\r\n    upgrade to Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33848](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33848).\r\n    - `PersistentVolumes` are unable to mount to custom vSphere hardened clusters using CSI charts. See [#35173](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35173).\r\n- **Harvester:**\r\n  - Upgrades from Harvester v0.3.0 are not supported.\r\n  - Deploying Fleet to Harvester clusters is not yet supported. Clusters, whether Harvester or non-Harvester, imported using the Virtualization Management page will result in the cluster not being listed on the Continuous Delivery page. See [#35049](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35049).\r\n- **Cluster Tools:**\r\n  - **Fleet:**\r\n    - Multiple `fleet-agent` pods may be created and deleted during initial downstream agent deployment; rather than just one. This resolves itself quickly, but is unintentional behavior. See [#33293](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33293).\r\n  - **Hardened clusters:** Not all cluster tools can currently be installed on a hardened cluster.\r\n  - **Rancher Backup:**\r\n    - When migrating to a cluster with the Rancher Backup feature, the server-url cannot be changed to a different location. It must continue to use the same URL.\r\n    - When running a newer version of the rancher-backup app to restore a backup made with an older version of the app, the `resourceSet` named `rancher-resource-set` will be restored to an older version that might be different from the one defined in the current running rancher-backup app. The workaround is to edit the rancher-backup app to trigger a reconciliation. See [#34495](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34495).\r\n    - Because Kubernetes v1.22 drops the apiVersion `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, trying to restore an existing backup file into a v1.22 cluster will fail because the backup file contains CRDs with the apiVersion v1beta1. There are two options to work around this issue: update the default `resourceSet` to collect the CRDs with the apiVersion v1, or update the default `resourceSet` and the client to use the new APIs internally. See [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/backups/migrating-rancher/#2-restore-from-backup-using-a-restore-custom-resource) and [#34154](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34154).\r\n  - **Monitoring:**\r\n    - Deploying Monitoring on a Windows cluster with win_prefix_path set requires users to deploy Rancher Wins Upgrader to restart wins on the hosts to start collecting metrics in Prometheus. See [#32535](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32535).\r\n    - Monitoring fails to upgrade when CRD is in a failed state. To work around this issue, use Helm to install the `rancher-monitoring` chart into the cluster directly, rather than using the Rancher UI. In order to set nodeSelector or tolerations to the `rancher-monitoring-crd` chart, you need to install the `rancher-monitoring-crd` and `rancher-monitoring` chart by using the Helm command via command line. Rancher UI will add support soon. See [#35744](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35744).\r\n    - When deploying a cluster on v1.22, the pod `rancher-monitoring-admission-patch` fails and times out, which causes the Monitoring install to fail. To deploy the rancher-monitoring chart successfully in RKE1/RKE2 1.22.x, please see [workaround](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35571#issuecomment-991140220). See also [#35571](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35571).\r\n  - **Logging:**\r\n    - Windows nodeAgents are not deleted when performing helm upgrade after disabling Windows logging on a Windows cluster. See [#32325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32325).\r\n  - **Istio versions:**\r\n    - Istio 1.5 is not supported in air gapped environments. Please note that the Istio project has ended support for Istio 1.5.\r\n    - [Istio 1.9 support ended](https://istio.io/latest/news/support/announcing-1.9-eol-final/) on October 8th, 2021.\r\n    - The Kiali dashboard bundled with 100.0.0+up1.10.2 errors on a page refresh. Instead of refreshing the page when needed, simply access Kiali using the dashboard link again. Everything else works in Kiali as expected, including the graph auto-fresh. See [#33739](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33739).\r\n    - In Istio v1.10.4, Kubernetes IP service is set to default IP, which does not work for all environments. To work around this issue, install Istio version 100.1.0+up1.11.4 in the downstream cluster, and installation will complete successfully. Note that the new install will not include the Kiali CRD. See [#35339](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35339).\r\n    - Istio 100.1.0+up1.11.4 no longer installs the Kiali CRD because it was removed from the upstream Helm chart starting in Kiali version 1.36. If you have upgraded from a previous version of rancher-istio installed to 100.1.0+up1.11.4, you will need to manually delete the `rancher-kiali-server-crd` found on the installed apps page, since it is no longer in use after the upgrade completes. See [#35686](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35686) for more information.\r\n    - A `failed calling webhook \"validation.istio.io\"` error will occur in air-gapped environments if the `istiod-istio-system` `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` exists, and you attempt a fresh install of Istio 1.11.x and higher. To work around this issue, run the command `kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration istiod-istio-system` and attempt your install again. See [#35742](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35742#issuecomment-994801502).\r\n    - Deprecated resources are not automatically removed and will cause errors during upgrades. Manual steps must be taken to migrate and/or cleanup resources before an upgrade is performed. See [#34699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34699).\r\n  - **Legacy Monitoring:**\r\n    - The Grafana instance inside Cluster Manager's Monitoring is not compatible with Kubernetes v1.21. To work around this issue, disable the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature in Kubernetes v1.21 and above. Note that this workaround will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.22. See [#33465](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/33465).\r\n    - In air gapped setups, the generated `rancher-images.txt` that is used to mirror images on private registries does not contain the images required to run Legacy Monitoring which is compatible with Kubernetes v1.15 clusters. If you are running Kubernetes v1.15 clusters in an air gapped environment, and you want to either install Legacy Monitoring or upgrade Legacy Monitoring to the latest that is offered by Rancher for Kubernetes v1.15 clusters, you will need to take one of the following actions:\r\n      - Upgrade the Kubernetes version so that you can use v0.2.x of the Monitoring application Helm chart\r\n      - Manually import the necessary images into your private registry for the Monitoring application to use\r\n    - When deploying any downstream cluster, Rancher logs errors that seem to be related to Monitoring even when Monitoring is not installed onto either cluster; specifically, Rancher logs that it `failed on subscribe` to the Prometheus CRs in the cluster because it is unable to get the resource `prometheus.meta.k8s.io`. These logs appear in a similar fashion for other Prometheus CRs (namely Alertmanager, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules), but do not seem to cause any other major impact in functionality. See [#32978](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/32978).\r\n    - Legacy Monitoring does not support Kubernetes v1.22 due to the `feature-gates` flag no longer being supported. See [#35574](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35574).\r\n    - After performing an upgrade to Rancher v2.6.3 from v2.6.2, the Legacy Monitoring custom metric endpoint stops working. To work around this issue, delete the service that is being targeted by the servicemonitor and allow it to be recreated; this will reload the pods that need to be targeted on a service sync. See [#35790](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35790).\r\n- **Docker installs:**\r\n  - UI issues may occur due to a longer startup time. User will receive an error message when launching Docker for the first time [#28800](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28800), and user is directed to username/password screen when accessing the UI after a Docker install of Rancher [#28798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/28798).\r\n  - On a Docker install upgrade and rollback, Rancher logs will repeatedly display the messages \"Updating workload `ingress-nginx/nginx-ingress-controller`\" and \"Updating service `frontend` with public endpoints\". Ingresses and clusters are functional and active, and logs resolve eventually. See [#35798](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/35798).\r\n- **Login to Rancher using ActiveDirectory with TLS:** See [#34325](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/34325).\r\n  - Upon an upgrade to v2.6.0, authenticating via Rancher against an ActiveDirectory server using TLS can fail if the certificates on the AD server do not support SAN attributes. This is a check enabled by default in Golang v1.15.\r\n  - The error received is \"Error creating ssl connection: LDAP Result Code 200 \"Network Error\": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\"\r\n  - To resolve this, the certificates on the AD server should be updated or replaced with new ones that support the SAN attribute. Alternatively this error can be ignored by setting \"GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0\" as an environment variable to Rancher server container.\r\n- **Rancher UI:**\r\n  - After clicking on the header of an expanded navigation group, the navigation group remains unchanged. See [#4368](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/4368).\r\n- **Legacy UI:**\r\n  - When using the Rancher v2.6 UI to add a new port of type ClusterIP to an existing Deployment created using the legacy UI, the new port will not be created upon saving. To work around this issue, repeat the procedure to add the port again. Users will notice the Service Type field will display as `Do not create a service`. Change this to ClusterIP and upon saving, the new port will be created successfully during this subsequent attempt.

When removing servers with etcd from the cluster, ensure that the k3s service is stopped before using `kubectl delete` to remove the node from the Kubernetes and etcd cluster. You should do this one node at a time to ensure that your cluster does not lose quorum. Failure to follow this process may result in K3s on the deleted node crashing, restarting, and rejoining the cluster.\r\n\r\n## Changes since v1.23.2+k3s1:\r\n* Update to v1.23.3 [(#5027)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5027)\r\n* Move containerd wait into exported function [(#5021)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5021)\r\n* Add Rocket.Chat to list of adopters [(#5017)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/5017)\r\n<!-- https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/compare/v1.23.2+k3s1...v1.23.3+k3s1 -->\r\n\r\n## Embedded Component Versions\r\n| Component | Version |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| Kubernetes | [v1.23.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#v1233) |\r\n| Kine | [v0.8.1](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine/releases/tag/v0.8.1) |\r\n| SQLite | [3.36.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_36_0.html) |\r\n| Etcd | [v3.5.1-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.1-k3s1) |\r\n| Containerd | [v1.5.9-k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.9-k3s1) |\r\n| Runc | [v1.0.3](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.3) |\r\n| Flannel | [v0.15.1](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/tag/v0.15.1) |\r\n| Metrics-server | [v0.5.2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.5.2) |\r\n| Traefik | [v2.5.6](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.5.6) |\r\n| CoreDNS | [v1.8.6](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.8.6) |\r\n| Helm-controller | [v0.11.7](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/releases/tag/v0.11.7) |\r\n| Local-path-provisioner | [v0.0.21](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/releases/tag/v0.0.21) |\r\n\r\n## Helpful Links\r\nAs always, we welcome and appreciate feedback from our community of users.

v3.8.0\r\n\r\nHelm v3.8.0 is a feature release. This release, we focused on OCI registries, support for Kubernetes 1.23, and more. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.\r\n\r\nThe community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there!\r\n\r\n- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\r\n  -  for questions and just to hang out\r\n  -  for discussing PRs, code, and bugs\r\n- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/696660622)\r\n- Test, debug, and contribute charts: [ArtifactHub/packages](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0)\r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n\r\n- OCI registry support for charts is now generally available. It has graduated out of being an experiment. Some changes over Helm 3.7 include:\r\n  - When setting a chart in the dependencies as OCI the version can be set to a range, like other dependencies\r\n  - SemVer tags that include build information can be pushed and used. OCI registries don't support `+` as a tag character. Helm translates the `+` to `_` when stored as a tag\r\n  - `helm registry login` now follows the same structure as the Docker CLI for storing credentials. The same location for registry configuration can be passed to both Helm and the Docker CLI\r\n- A `--list-repo-url` flag has been added to `helm search hub` to quickly show the repositories URL.\r\n- Release names are validated during installation\r\n- Added support for installing Helm on Windows via Cygwin\r\n- Added support for Kubernetes 1.23\r\n\r\n## Installation and Upgrading\r\n\r\nDownload Helm v3.8.0.

This way imported quorum queues will have a desired\r\n   number of replicas from the start.\r\n\r\n   GitHub issue: [#3986](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3986)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency Upgrades\r\n\r\n* Osiris was [upgraded to `1.2.4`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4)\r\n\r\n## Source Code Archives\r\n\r\nTo obtain source code of the entire distribution, please download the archive named `rabbitmq-server-3.9.13.tar.xz`\r\ninstead of the source tarball produced by GitHub.\r\n", "created_at": "2022-01-18T22:47:22Z", "project": "RabbitMQ", "repo": "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server", "type": "Message", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v1.72.0", "tag_name": "v1.72.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.72.0", "repo_url": "https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "body": "### Changes\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): add support for `@` modifier, which is enabled by default in Prometheus starting from [Prometheus v2.33.0](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/10121). See [these docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#modifier) and [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1348). VictoriaMetrics extends `@` modifier with the following additional features:\r\n  * It can contain arbitrary expression. For example, `foo @ (end() - 1h)` would return `foo` value at `end - 1 hour` timestamp on the selected time range `[start ... end]`. Another example: `foo @ (now() - 10m)` would return `foo` value 10 minutes ago from the current time.\r\n  * It can be put everywhere in the query. For example, `sum(foo) @ start()` would calculate `sum(foo)` at `start` timestamp on the selected time range `[start ... end]`.\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): add support for optional `keep_metric_names` modifier, which can be applied to all the [rollup functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#rollup-functions) and [transform functions](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html#transform-functions). This modifier prevents from deleting metric names from function results. For example, `rate({__name__=~\"foo|bar\"}[5m]) keep_metric_names` leaves `foo` and `bar` metric names in `rate()` results. This feature provides an additional workaround for [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/949).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add support for Kubernetes service discovery in the current namespace in the same way as [Prometheus does](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/9881). For example, the following config limits pod discovery to the namespace where vmagent runs:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  scrape_configs:\r\n  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'\r\n    kubernetes_sd_configs:\r\n    - role: pod\r\n      namespaces:\r\n        own_namespace: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): add `__meta_kubernetes_node_provider_id` label for discovered Kubernetes nodes in the same way as [Prometheus does](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/9603).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): log error message when remote storage returns 400 or 409 http errors. This should simplify detection and debugging of this case. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1911).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): expose `promscrape_stale_samples_created_total` metric for monitoring the total number of created stale samples when scraping Prometheus targets. See [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) for the information on when stale samples (aka staleness markers) can be created.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmrestore](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html): store `restore-in-progress` file in `-dst` directory while `vmrestore` is running. This file is automatically deleted when `vmrestore` is successfully finished. This helps detecting incompletely restored data on VictoriaMetrics start. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1958).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): print the last sample timestamp when the data migration is interrupted either by user or by error. This helps continuing the data migration from the interruption moment. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1236).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): expose `vmalert_remotewrite_total` metric at `/metrics` page. This makes possible calculating SLOs for error rate during writing recording rules and alert state to `-remoteWrite.url` with the query `vmalert_remotewrite_errors_total / vmalert_remotewrite_total`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2040). Thanks to @afoninsky .\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): add `stripPort` template function in the same way as [Prometheus does](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/10002).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html): add `parseDuration` template function in the same way as [Prometheus does](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/8817).\r\n* FEATURE: [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html): add `stale_samples_over_time(m[d])` function for calculating the number of [staleness marks](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#prometheus-staleness-markers) for time series `m` over the duration `d`. This function may be useful for detecting flapping metrics at scrape targets, which periodically disappear and then appear again.\r\n* FEATURE: [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html): add support for `extra_filters` option. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1863).\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): improve UX according to [this feature request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1960). Thanks to @Loori-R .\r\n* FEATURE: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): limit the number of requests sent to VictoriaMetrics during zooming / scrolling. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2064).\r\n\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): make sure that `vmagent` replicas scrape the same targets at different time offsets when [replication is enabled in vmagent clustering mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#scraping-big-number-of-targets). This guarantees that the [deduplication](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication) consistently leaves samples from the same `vmagent` replica.\r\n* BUGFIX: return the proper response stub from `/api/v1/query_exemplars` handler, which is needed for Grafana v8+. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/1999).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmctl](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmctl.html): fix a few edge cases and improve migration speed for OpenTSDB importer. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2019).\r\n* BUGFIX: fix possible data race when searching for time series matching `{key=~\"value|\"}` filter over time range covering multipe days. See [this pull request](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/2032). Thanks to @waldoweng for the provided fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): do not send staleness markers on graceful shutdown. This follows Prometheus behavior. See [this comment](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2013#issuecomment-1006994079).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html): properly set `__address__` label in `dockerswarm_sd_config`. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2038). Thanks to @ashtuchkin for the fix.\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix incorrect calculations for graph limits on y axis. This could result in incorrect graph rendering in some cases. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2037).\r\n* BUGFIX: [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#vmui): fix handling for multi-line queries. See [this issue](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/2039).\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [full changelog](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/CHANGELOG.html).\r\n\r\n### How to run VictoriaMetrics\r\n\r\nUnpack the `victoria-metrics-*.tar.gz` archive and read [these docs](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics#operation).\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*.tag.gz` archive contains the following tools:\r\n\r\n* [vmagent](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmagent/README.md)\r\n* [vmalert](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmalert/README.md)\r\n* [vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmauth/README.md)\r\n* [vmbackup](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmbackup/README.md)\r\n* [vmctl](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmctl/README.md)\r\n* [vmrestore](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/app/vmrestore/README.md)\r\n\r\n`vmutils-*-enterprise.tar.gz` archive contains the following additional [enterprise tools](https://victoriametrics.com/enterprise.html):\r\n\r\n* [vmbackupmanager](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackupmanager.html)\r\n* [vmgateway](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmgateway.html)\r\n\r\nThe corresponding docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/victoriametrics/).\r\nCluster version is available [here](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/cluster).", "created_at": "2022-01-18T21:28:10Z", "project": "VictoriaMetrics", "repo": "VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics", "type": "Db", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v0.7.4", "tag_name": "v0.7.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/releases/tag/v0.7.4", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary", "body": "## 0.7.4 (2022/01/18)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In newly-created scopes, if default role creation is not disabled, the roles\n  will now contain a grant to allow listing targets.

refactoring along with some critical bug fixes and user enhancements.  This release includes fixes for user-reported critical bugs as well as fixes and enhancements to improve the E2e test coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Deprecation Notice**:  Jiva and cStor `out-of-tree external` provisioners are deprecated now in favor of the corresponding CSI Drivers. The out of tree provisioners for Jiva and cStor will stop working from Kubernetes 1.22 and forward as the version of the custom resources used by those provisioners will be deprecated. We strongly recommend you plan for migrating your volumes to [cStor CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md) or [Jiva CSI](https://github.com/openebs/upgrade/blob/master/docs/migration.md#migrating-jiva-external-provisioned-volumes-to-jiva-csi-volumes-experimental) as early as possible.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help with the migration please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Upgrade and Backward Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nPlease review this list prior to deciding to upgrade:\r\n\r\n- Kubernetes 1.18 or higher release is recommended as this release uses features of Kubernetes that will not be compatible with older Kubernetes releases. Some of the engines might require you to have a higher Kubernetes version as the CSI drivers have been upgraded to the latest versions. For example, Kubernetes 1.19.12 or higher is recommended for using Rawfile Local PV. \r\n- OpenEBS has deprecated arch-specific container images in favor of multi-arch container images. For example, images like `cstor-pool-arm64:x.y.x` should be replaced with corresponding multi-arch image `cstor-pool:x.y.x`.\r\n- The non-csi provisioners for cstor and jiva are not included by default with 3.0 helm chart or operator.yaml. You can still continue to use them. The older provisioners are released with the v2.12.2 version at the moment and only patch releases (to fix severe security vulnerabilities) will be supported going forward. If you need help making a decision on upgrading or migrating, please reach out to us on our Kubernetes Community slack channel [#openebs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CUAKPFU78).\r\n\r\n### Component versions\r\n\r\nOpenEBS is a collection of data engines and operators to create different types of replicated and local persistent volumes for Kubernetes Stateful workloads. Kubernetes volumes can be provisioned via CSI Drivers or using Out-of-tree Provisioners.

In addition, the following max hop limits will be set by default:\r\n\r\n * worker and API server Nodes, and bastions, will have a limit of 1 hop.\r\n * control plane nodes will have a limit of 3 hops to accommodate for controller Pods without host networking that need to assume roles.\r\n\r\nThis will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  instanceMetadata:\r\n    httpTokens: optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External ServiceAccountPermissions\r\n\r\nMany of kOps addons can now make direct use of external permissions.\r\nThis can be enabled by adding the following to the Cluster spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  iam:\r\n    useServiceAccountExternalPermissions: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this is only available using the AWS cloud provider.\r\n\r\n## Managed nvidia instances\r\n\r\nkOps can now provision instances with nvidia GPUs and configure it for container workloads without the need of hooks and operators. See [GPU support](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/gpu/)\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n* New clusters on AWS will no longer provision an SSH public key by default. To provision\r\n  an SSH public key on a new cluster, use the `--ssh-public-key` flag to `kops create cluster`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. This defers changes to these files until the time of `terraform apply`.\r\n  This feature may be temporarily disabled by turning off the `TerraformManagedFiles` feature flag\r\n  using `export KOPS_FEATURE_FLAGS=\"-TerraformManagedFiles\"`.\r\n\r\n* kOps now implements graceful rotation of its Certificate Authorities and the service\r\n  account signing key. See the documentation on [How to rotate all secrets / credentials](../operations/rotate-secrets.md)\r\n\r\n* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* kOps now supports Debian 11 (Bullseye).\r\n\r\n* kOps can now use [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/) as a drop-in replacement for dns-controller.\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n\r\n## Control plane pods no longer mount /srv/kubernetes\r\n\r\n For security reasons, `/srv/kubernetes` is no longer mounted in the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager Pods. This also means the files in the default file assets path will be unavailable. If you have file assets or other files needed by kube-apiserver, you must put these into `/srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/` or `/srv/kubernetes/kube-controller-manager`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor file assets, it means adding an explicit path as shown below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  fileAssets:\r\n  - name: audit-policy-config\r\n    path: /srv/kubernetes/kube-apiserver/audit-policy-config.yaml # make sure you add the path\r\n    roles:\r\n    - Master\r\n    content: |\r\n      apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1\r\n      kind: Policy\r\n      rules:\r\n      - level: Metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other breaking changes\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.\r\n\r\n* The legacy addons from `https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons` have been deprecated and will not be available in Kubernetes 1.23+. Use [managed addons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons) instead.\r\n\r\n* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.\r\n\r\n* The `assets` phase of `kops update cluster` has been removed. It is replaced by the new `kops get assets --copy` command.\r\n\r\n* Support for importing and converting kubeup clusters has been removed.\r\n\r\n* Support for Cilium and RHEL 8 has been removed. Cilium users will need to migrate to a distribution with a newer Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n# Required actions\r\n\r\n* Amazon Linux 2 users are encouraged to use the AMIs based on the 5.10 Linux kernel. See [the documentation](../operations/images.md#amazon-linux-2) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Terraform support now requires Terraform >=0.15.0.\r\n  Users on older versions must follow Terraform's recommended upgrade path of applying one minor version at a time prior to running `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* The kOps Terraform support now renders managed files through the Terraform configuration instead \r\n  of writing them to S3 directly. If, after upgrading kOps and applying a new Terraform plan,\r\n  you subsequently downgrade to an earlier version of kOps, the generated plan will delete these\r\n  files, breaking the cluster. Prior to applying the plan, you will need to orphan all the\r\n  `aws_s3_bucket_object` objects the plan wants to destroy. Use `terraform state rm` on each of them.\r\n  Then re-run `terraform plan` until there are no such objects in the plan.\r\n  \r\n  If you applied the plan without first orphaning all of these objects, fix the cluster by re-running\r\n  `kops update cluster --target terraform`.\r\n\r\n* Terraform users of clusters with names beginning with digits will need to move resources prior to upgrading to kOps 1.22. Some of the following commands will need to be run depending on the particular cluster configuration. Confirm the Terraform plan doesn't destroy any of these resources before running `terraform apply`.\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # View the existing terraform resource names for the exact value to use\r\n  HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME=123-cluster-example-com\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_internet_gateway.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_internet_gateway.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_route_table.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_route_table.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  terraform state mv \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\" \"aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association.prefix_${HYPHENATED_CLUSTER_NAME}\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Lyft CNI is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for CentOS 8 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Debian 9 (Stretch) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for RHEL 7 is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of kOps.\r\n\r\n* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).\r\n\r\n* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.\r\n\r\n* The `TerraformJSON` feature flag is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23. Only native HCL2 Terraform output will be supported.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.\r\n\r\n* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.\r\n\r\n# Other changes of note\r\n\r\n* Support for shell completion has been substantially improved. kOps has added support for shell completion in `fish` and `PowerShell`.\r\n\r\n* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.\r\n\r\n* There is a new command `kops get assets` for listing image and file assets used by a cluster.\r\n  It also includes a `--copy` flag to copy the assets to local repositories.\r\n  See the documentation on [Using local asset repositories](../operations/asset-repository.md) for more information.\r\n  \r\n* kOps now provisions TLS server certificates signed by the Kubernetes general CA to kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler.\r\n  The previous behavior of using self-signed certs may be restored by setting `kubeControllerManager.tlsCertFile` and/or\r\n  `kubeScheduler.tlsCertFile` to `\"\"` in the cluster spec.\r\n\r\n* Cilium now supports the wireguard protocol for transparent encryption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1.22.2 to 1.22.3\r\n\r\n* Release 1.22.2 [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#12797](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12797)\r\n* Add support for etcd v3.5.1 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12826](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12826)\r\n* Update Calico and Canal to v3.20.3 for kOps 1.22 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12836](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12836)\r\n* Add support for --dns flag in Docker config [@jwolski2](https://github.com/jwolski2) [#12789](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12789)\r\n* Reissue client keypairs on issuer change [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#12846](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12846)\r\n* Add gofumpt scripts [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12867](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12867)\r\n* Update Go to v1.16.11 [@hakman](https://github.com/hakman) [#12897](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12897)\r\n* Fix external-dns service name [@johngmyers](https://github.com/johngmyers) [#12893](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/12893)\r\n* pkg/apis/kops: Allow configuring dockerd --max-* upload and download concurrency and retry options.

Thank you!\r\n\r\nA broad range of improvements, including support for cloud services such as Memcached auto-discovery and Amazon SNS.\r\n\r\n## Cortex\r\n\r\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Expose default configuration values to the command line options. Note that setting these explicitly to zero will no longer cause the default to be used. If the default is desired, then do set the option. The following are affected: #4276\r\n  - `-memberlist.stream-timeout`\r\n  - `-memberlist.retransmit-factor`\r\n  - `-memberlist.pull-push-interval`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-interval`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-nodes`\r\n  - `-memberlist.gossip-to-dead-nodes-time`\r\n  - `-memberlist.dead-node-reclaim-time`\r\n* [CHANGE] `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` previously applied to chunks from ingesters and store separately; now the two combined should not exceed the limit. #4260\r\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the metric `memberlist_kv_store_value_bytes` has been removed due to values no longer being stored in-memory as encoded bytes. #4345\r\n* [CHANGE] Some files and directories created by Cortex components on local disk now have stricter permissions, and are only readable by owner, but not group or others. #4394\r\n* [CHANGE] The metric `cortex_deprecated_flags_inuse_total` has been renamed to `deprecated_flags_inuse_total` as part of using grafana/dskit functionality. #4443\r\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: Add new `-ruler.query-stats-enabled` which when enabled will report the `cortex_ruler_query_seconds_total` as a per-user metric that tracks the sum of the wall time of executing queries in the ruler in seconds. #4317\r\n* [FEATURE] Query Frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_series_total` and `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` per-user counters to expose the number of series and bytes fetched as part of queries. These metrics can be enabled with the `-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). #4343\r\n* [FEATURE] AlertManager: Add support for SNS Receiver. #4382\r\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add label `status` to metric `cortex_distributor_ingester_append_failures_total` #4442\r\n* [FEATURE] Queries: Added `present_over_time` PromQL function, also some TSDB optimisations. #4505\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add timeout for waiting on compactor to become ACTIVE in the ring. #4262\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce memory used by streaming queries, particularly in ruler. #4341\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow experimental configuration of disabling of heartbeat timeouts by setting the relevant configuration value to zero. Applies to the following: #4342\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow heartbeats to be explicitly disabled by setting the interval to zero. This is considered experimental. This applies to the following configuration options: #4344\r\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ingester.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: optimized receive path for processing ring state updates, to help reduce CPU utilization in large clusters. #4345\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: expose configuration of memberlist packet compression via `-memberlist.compression=enabled`. #4346\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Go version to 1.16.6. #4362\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated Prometheus to include changes from prometheus/prometheus#9083. Now whenever `/labels` API calls include matchers, blocks store is queried for `LabelNames` with matchers instead of `Series` calls which was inefficient. #4380\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: performance improvements in socket and memory handling. #4429 #4377\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Exemplars are now emitted for all gRPC calls and many operations tracked by histograms. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New options `-server.http-listen-network` and `-server.grpc-listen-network` allow binding as 'tcp4' or 'tcp6'. #4462\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rulers: Using shuffle sharding subring on GetRules API. #4466\r\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support memcached auto-discovery via `auto-discovery` flag, introduced by thanos in https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/4487. Both AWS and Google Cloud memcached service support auto-discovery, which returns a list of nodes of the memcached cluster. #4412\r\n* [BUGFIX] Fixes a panic in the query-tee when comparing result. #4465\r\n* [BUGFIX] Frontend: Fixes @ modifier functions (start/end) when splitting queries by time. #4464\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: compactor will no longer try to compact blocks that are already marked for deletion. Previously compactor would consider blocks marked for deletion within `-compactor.deletion-delay / 2` period as eligible for compaction. #4328\r\n* [BUGFIX] HA Tracker: when cleaning up obsolete elected replicas from KV store, tracker didn't update number of cluster per user correctly. #4336\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed counting of PromQL evaluation errors as user-errors when updating `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`. #4335\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: When using block storage, prevent any reads or writes while the ingester is stopping. This will prevent accessing TSDB blocks once they have been already closed. #4304\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed ingester stuck on start up (LEAVING ring state) when `-ingester.heartbeat-period=0` and `-ingester.unregister-on-shutdown=false`. #4366\r\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: panic during shutdown while fetching batches from cache. #4397\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: After query-frontend restart, querier may have lower than configured concurrency. #4417\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: forward only changes, not entire original message. #4419\r\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: don't accept old tombstones as incoming change, and don't forward such messages to other gossip members. #4420\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed panic when querying exemplars and using `-distributor.shard-by-all-labels=false`. #4473\r\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: honor querier minT,maxT if `nil` SelectHints are passed to Select(). #4413\r\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed panic while collecting Prometheus metrics. #4483\r\n* [BUGFIX] Update go-kit package to fix spurious log messages #4544\r\n", "created_at": "2021-11-25T15:16:47Z", "project": "Cortex", "repo": "cortexproject/cortex", "type": "Monitor", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-15T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "Flux 1.24.3", "tag_name": "1.24.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/releases/tag/1.24.3", "repo_url": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux", "body": "### [Flux v1 is in maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320)\r\n\r\nAll users are encouraged to migrate to Flux v2 or begin planning their migration, and to continue filing issues if migrations are blocked.\r\n\r\n# 1.24.3 (2021-11-24)\r\n\r\nThis release includes the [new host keys][github.blog-2021-09-01] for GitHub, changes effective on November 16, that could be important for users of Flux.\r\n\r\nThis release also includes a base image upgrade to the Alpine 3.14.3 upstream that mitigates low and medium severity CVE warnings from the base image.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Add fingerprints for new github.com host keys [fluxcd/flux#3571][]\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to @kingdonb, @stefanprodan, @squaremo, and @hiddeco for their contributions to this release.\r\n\r\n[fluxcd/flux#3571]: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/pull/3571\r\n[github.blog-2021-09-01]: https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/", "created_at": "2021-11-24T13:50:00Z", "project": "Flux", "repo": "fluxcd/flux", "type": "Ci", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2019-09-16T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "", "tag_name": "v2.2.19", "html_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/commit/379dd20cf91865c97f8dd5bb2c8e7f69fd1c00f2", "repo_url": "https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant", "body": "Release 2.2.19", "created_at": "2021-11-05T21:15:44Z", "project": "Vagrant", "repo": "hashicorp/vagrant", "type": "Infrastructure", "hosting": "github", "add_time": "2020-11-01T11:11:37Z"}, {"name": "v3004", "tag_name": "v3004", "html_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt/releases/tag/v3004", "repo_url": "https://github.com/saltstack/salt", "body": "WARNING: The tarball generated by GitHub will not have the correct version information when using a version not ending in .0 .
